As a result, working at Odoo in USA feels like working on a moon base that is totally separate. You never know why the company makes its decisions, where things are headed, what the goals are, what it stands for... For example, odoo just released a brand new version, but there was literally ZERO marketing about it. Instead they just sent out a ton of emails and push notifications to people in the us, canada, mexico and latin america about going to their annual event in BELGIUM. This is the kind of thing they do, because the strategy is not including this part of the globe.\n\nIt might not feel like a very bad job if it were not here in san francisco- but it simply does not even compare to other tech companies in the area, in terms of standards like salary, vacation time, WFH policy, equity, 401k, offsite company events, meal service, etc. They say they are growing all the time, but that just seems to mean that they are hiring more and more underpaid people instead of ppaying their current employees what they deserve. People are normally disappointed with their annual reviews and raises, THIS is why the job hunt tends to start at month 13 of the odoo carreer.\n\nthe partner system has flaws, we recruit partners but we are encouraged to just sign up anyone that might want to be a partner- it doesn't matter if they are going to be good at it or not. we try not to let really bad ones in, but still, the system leads to bad partners, and bad partners get disappaointed when they don't do well, and this spreads the word in a bad way. or, the partners don't do a good job of setting up the system for their customers and so their customers get disatisfied with odoo. Either way it's not good for spreading the word and getting a repuatation.\n\nAlso- if you are in any of the sales teams here (there are 3 plus a customer success team) then you will find yourself gradually getting fewer and few leads because of a few issues mostly involving overhiring and a tiny marketing budget. Seriously- do a google search on ERP SYSTEM ( which is what odoo is) and you will not find Odoo. The company does not spend money to advertise.\n\nOn top of the daily frustrations with the company and trying to do your job right, the vacation policy is really bad- it is two weeks maximum per year, and if you try to use sick time for something the company thinks is actually vacation, they will punish you for it , change your request to \"no pay time off\" and make the decision right when they cut your paycheck without even letting you talk to HR about it.

We could get the place clean by 10:45, all right--if we broke the health and corporate rules about when to tear things down. And of course if that was ever found out we were in deep. And if we went over 10:45 we were also in trouble. Management sometimes has some very unrealistic ideas about what the job actually entails and what rules and boundaries should go with that.\n\nThe pay in my state starts near minimum wage. The ceiling for a barista is $10/hr, which you hit when you've been there about five years. But tips help, and some high-volume affluent stores will have tips up to $4/hr.\n\nThere's also a tendency to have fanatical management.

Lack of transparency: A number of folks were let go without due explanation to the rest of the company. In multiple (too many) cases the reasons listed were completely fabricated and did not convey the truth, just what was convenient for the founders to say - this is after hearing the other side of the story.\n2. Low retention rate: Folks are constantly quitting Shippo. Ask why.\n3. Poor hiring decisions: In 2017 ten new hires were let go before completing a full year at Shippo. A lot of the remaining new hires from that year ended up quitting/being let go the year after.\n4. Gossip culture: The founders constantly engage in gossip culture, once they hear something negative about an employee, they will use it as leverage against them.\n5. Not feedback-oriented: One of the main reasons many quit at Shippo is that the founding team does not take well to feedbak nor do they improve on it. So folks are either asked to leave or independently decide to quit after a long period of being frustrated.\n6. Blame culture: Founders typically blame their shortcomings on one of the departments, or individuals, that report to them. (They will probably try to blame this review on someone else).\n7. Brain drain: Due to the low retention rate, little knowledge is accumulating in the team and past mistakes are constantly repeating. When folks attempt to point out that mistakes are being repeated and attempt to offer a solution, they are singled out as bringing down the team spirit.\n8. Unfit CEO: The CEO never showed any real, leadership or otherwise, skills at Shippo - constantly engaging in blaming others and lashing out when someone disagrees with her. She seems too busy building her own personal brand and taking unexplicably long vacations. Her, otherwise admirable, public opinions/statements rarely translate to actual wisdom/leadership in handling difficult situations. After working at Shippo for some time, one is only left to question the authenticity of those public remarks.\n9. Unfit President: The President has chronic management issues - he is a big part of why Shippo has a blame culture. He very rarely takes responsibility for his own mistakes or admits his negative influence on teams' productivity and accountability. He constantly gives the impression that he wants to know he's the smartest one in the room. Presidents usually compliment a CEO, not this one; he takes equaly long vacations and does not seem to stand up to the CEO. Every department he has ever managed has failed: Engineering (big layoffs), product (big layoffs), design (big layoffs).\n10. Founders in denial: CEO & President have often said nice-sounding things like \"if and when the company outgrows us, we will step down and find better-equipped leadership\". Funny thing is, they've been holding back the company for a long time, and it was brought to their attention, yet they are still there and in denial.\n\nShippo founders lucked out with hiring good folks, so don't be fooled if your interviews go well. In many cases those interviewers themselves might be quitting soon, as evidenced by the low retention rate. Of course they cannot disclose that in the interview, so don't expect them to.\n\nIMO most folks quit at Shippo because the founders constantly turn their back on those who built the business for them as soon as they ask for improvements that would inconvenience the founders or diminish their role, even if said improvements would help the company overall.\n\nI recommend you do not join if you're currently considering this for a full time role. You will quickly reach a ceiling where you need either the CEO's or President's approval for everything that you do, and you'll have to decide between quitting and leaving what you worked on behind or putting up with two inexperienced first-time finders who are not willing to follow your lead in your area of expertise. This applies even to executive positions - you will quickly realize you are expendable the moment you disagree with the founders, simply because they can.", "I had considered writing a longer review than this to share feedback about the executive leadership team, primarily the co-founders, but the review from 3/29 titled \u201cImmature Founding Team\u201d does an excellent job at summing up many of the pervasive issues crippling this organization.\n\nFor the most part, my experience working at Shippo was defined by many talented, competent, and empathetic colleagues I had the opportunity to work with on a daily basis.\n\nUnfortunately, executive leadership had and continues to have no interest investing in their people professionally. They anticipate that you\u2019ll come in and do the work asked of you with little to no guidance or vision-based leadership. Retention rate, because of this, is incredibly low and it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone within the organization that talented people are leaving on a fairly regular basis.\n\nThe co-founders operate from a very closed door, \u201ctop-down\u201d approach, with the assumption employees will make up for their managerial shortcomings through hard work and a general lack of appreciation for that hard work.\n\nLack of product-market fit is another puzzle piece this leadership team has been unable to solve for some time. It\u2019s unclear how they see this organization growing in the long term if they continue failing to understand where their business fits into the shipping ecosystem.\n\nIn general, there is great promise for both this team of people and the business they\u2019ve built, but executive leadership needs to develop pretty significant self-awareness if they want to see Shippo succeed.\n\nThat success will require different people who understand how to lead, motivate, and innovate for significant future growth to be possible."], "cloudreach": ["- Colleagues travel for projects a lot, so sometimes it can seem like people are coming and going\n- Growing pains that come with every org growing at this rate, but leadership is working hard to implement processes that help the org scale", "New people fundamentala seemed rushed new levels were all over the place\nFinance and expense operations need work should be better for a consulting company where majority of us have to travel on a weekly basis and are the bread and butter of the organization\nvision is all over the place\nLeadership is disconnected", "used to be fresh and bold, now just feels like we are trying to be every other giant boring corporation. too by the book. new people from big corps with no understanding of what made cloudreach special seem to be the only ones with a say on anything anymore which is a shame.", "The leadership team does not know how to lead.

Culture- This company is ran like an elementary school or a dysfunctional summer camp. There is an ongoing joke about how we're surprised we don't have to raise our hands to use the restroom. I totally understand things like being mindful of breaks and your phone, but there have been times were I took my phone out to check on a family emergency and got publicly called out for it. The culture at Yelp is shoving it down your throat that you LOVE Yelp and you are SO LUCKY to be working at Yelp. Our monthly meetings would involve bashing other companies (ex., the head of the office mocked Google's walk out against sexual harassment) and avoiding obvious issues within the company. You are HIGHLY encouraged to attend happy hours frequently and majority of the well performing teams, such as the one I was on, go out multiple times a month. Most of it comes out of YOUR pocket and can fall on weekends and Friday nights. Successful managers at Yelp consider Yelp their life (date within the company, have only friends within the company, etc.) I know more about my managers sex life than I ever should.\n2. Job Itself - It's cold calling, you know that when you apply so that shouldn't really be a con, HOWEVER, it's how they approach cold calling. At exactly 8:30 you need to be at your desk ready to go. At exactly 12:00 everyone takes lunch (HR says you can take it anywhere between 11-2 but good luck trying to tell your manager that). They have no flex when it comes to a sales cycle. If it's the day before Christmas or the day before Memorial Day weekend they expect the same despite the obvious fact that sales globally decrease. Your managers get on your calls and feed you line for line what you should be saying. Essentially you are a puppet to your manager. It takes zero skill. (For reference, I was putting up 30k a month which is 10k higher than quota.) No matter how much you do in a day/month/week/etc. it isn't enough and even when you do well, no one is happy there, they just can't tell you that. I know several people who have won the most esteemed awards at Yelp and all HAVE QUIT. You're forced to stand and your desk and \"bring the energy\" like we're 12 year old cheerleaders. The \"rewards\" they give you for closing deals is hilarious. Sometimes it's things like \"dare your manager to do a push up!\" or \"one free breakfast sandwich!\" Again, elementary school. There is also nowhere to go up. You can either cold call, manage people who cold call, do higher volume cold calling, or pray to get into Mid Market/National. I quit the leadership development program because the mission of it is to teach you how to brainwash employees and use what they say against them. Why should managers be asking me questions like \"Are you closer with your mom or your dad?\" \"How is your current relationship going?\"\n3. Management - Possibly the worst part of this job. It's amazing how they haven't been sued yet because not only is management known for being incredibly unprofessional, but there is NO DIVERSITY. Every single director (in my time I've seen 8 different) is white. Every. Single. One. This is a company of 1200+ employees and you're telling me there isn't ONE POC you can promote? Managers are the same and they're all 23-25. They promote people into management extremely early and they are managers for training classes so you're forced to learn from someone who doesn't even know how to do their job. In addition, management is incredibly immature, power hungry and an overall mess. I went though 4 different managers, all equally problematic. One time there was a bad snowstorm and they were closing down Port Authority and suspending trains. I was told I should \"stay at a friends house\" or use my PTO if I wanted to leave. I wound up staying, it was extremely dangerous getting home and I didn't get back to my house until 2AM with work the next day. Another time I was in the bathroom with a stomachache for FIVE minutes (sorry TMI) and my manager texted me \"Hey where are you?\" I've been told by countless people in power that we should 'of course' take our LEGAL 10 minute breaks, but make sure we earned them. This has been said to me at the end of a week where I've closed 21k. Seems like I earned it. Oh, and one more thing, keep an eye on your managers and directors because they're sleeping with reps and doing obscene amounts of Adderall.\n4.

What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, \"You have to work on weekends/vacations\" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am. It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.\n\n2) Poor management. I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence. Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too \"difficult.\" People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into. So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because \"emotional intelligence\" or \"adaptive leadership\" are not taken seriously.\n\n3) Jerks. Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same). Years ago, that wasn't the case. I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.\n\n4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.

It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.\n* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.", "I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day.

You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.\n\nYou'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.
