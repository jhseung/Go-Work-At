In fact, the directors had my back throughout. When I needed support, they were there, and did their absolute best to do whatever they could to help. They set the strongest possible example, always thinking of their employees first - and by the way, such strong examples are what really sets a company's culture. At all times, I was empowered, supported, and (maybe most importantly) trusted.

The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.\n- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.\n\nGranted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.", "Creative, enthusiastic, efficient, appreciative, inventive", "I love meeting new people.

In practice, not true.\n\n6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a \"con\" to that, too (see below).", "* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).\n* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.\n* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.\n* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.\n* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).\n* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.\n* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.\n\nNeither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.\n* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.\n* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance \"even at Google\" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.", "You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.\n\nYou'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world\n\nYou'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.\n\nYou'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing\n\nYou'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.\n\nThere are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.\n\nYour pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.\n\nGoogle cares about how it treats its employees.\n\nThe campus is like an academic campus in many ways.\n\nThere are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.\n\nYou'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.\n\nIf and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume.

There is a lot of transparency around strategy and how we are growing. I'm particularly impressed by the amount of focus on professional development at Honor. There is a lot of coaching and feedback available. I feel like my manager is a partner in my growth and is expanding the job opportunities available to me.\n\nThe team is fun, supportive, and everyone challenges each other to be better.", "Honor is trying to change an industry that needs more light to be shined on it."], "Liventus": ["Great company to work for!", "Great company environment. Great support from peers. H1B sponsorship", "Have been working here for over 10 years. Nice and friendly co-workers with a great management team all striving for one goal. Definitely an environment for those who love challenges and the opportunity to learn.", "Liventus is a amazing place to work. The job is constantly challenging and the work environment is pretty friendly. If you aren't comfortable with the volatility, job security and salary a start up would provide but at the same time isn't sure if the aggressive and competitive enviroment a big company would have, Liventus has that good balance of a mid-size company with the pros of both worlds. Your input will be heard and many of the developers are always pushing to use new and exciting technologies.\n\nThey are very flexible when it comes to vacation days and sick leaves so that's a plus as well. The company culture is very friendly, I recommend checking the Facebook page to see a glimpse of the many events thrown by the company.", "Liventus is a great place to work if you are a real go-getter type of person. This is not a place for anyone that just wants do a regular 9-5 job. You will a have a job title, but the responsibilities will go above and beyond that. So people that like challenges will really enjoy working here. The company is always looking to grow and become better. Which is proven with how much the staff has grown and the addition of remote offices in the past few years."]}
