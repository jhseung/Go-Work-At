I've worked for other scribe companies as a pre-medical student, but Robin was by far the best.

Although management oversees the scribes, we mostly worked independently and on our own schedule. We were free to take on as many tasks as we'd like, and opportunities to move up or engage in a new project were always there.\n\nSome of the closest relationships I've built with physicians was at Robin as well.\n\nYou definitely get what you put in, and because this is a startup company, there are many opportunities for scribes to grow.", "-A real startup experience.

They will not tap you on the shoulder and ask if you would like a promotion, but if you tell them that you have higher aspirations and you want to expand your role, they will give you more responsibilities. You must be a self-starter to reap this benefit!!! At bigger, more established companies, you may have to work for years to be promoted, but there is a lot of room to grow here as the company is still young.\n-It's a medical scribe AND a tech company, so you can grow in either direction if one interests you more\n-Close proximity to campus\n-Motivated coworkers who are excited about healthcare. It's a diverse group of college students, those who are in their gap year, and those who have worked at various scribe or tech companies before\n-Higher pay than other scribe companies\n-Monthly socials = fun team bonding", "I've been in the medical scribe industry for almost a decade. Robin is so different (for the better) that my experience hardly plays a role in my day-to-day. Most scribe companies are staffing firms that have created some medical scribe training. We're a bad a** tech company who happens to provide a great remote medical scribe service. I moved halfway across the country and left my old life behind for this opportunity. I haven't regretted a moment of the journey.\n\nFor scribes - We're simply offering more for our employees than any other company out there. More money? Sure. More opportunity for advancement? Early and often. Scheduling flexibility? By far the best in the industry. But that's just the beginning. Our scribes have a legitimate voice and make a legitimate impact in a rapidly growing and evolving healthcare tech company. The culture is laid back. Robin throws more money at food, drinks, and company socials/events in a month than other companies do in a year. We're also about to start offering CLINICAL ROTATIONS to our scribes as we add more specialties. That's just unheard of in the industry. With some budding partnerships and big clients on the horizon, we're just scratching the surface here.\n\nFor clients - Plug in the device and start seeing patients. That's about as complicated as it gets. This site is more for prospective employees, but it's worth pointing out just how easy it is for our providers as well.\n\nI've never been surrounded by such a passionate, intelligent, and effective team. We just analyze problems and craft solutions differently than anyone else I've encountered. Robin truly has a chance to make a positive impact on healthcare as a whole and I feel incredibly lucky to be at the center of that effort. It's going to be a wild ride, but I'm loving every moment!", "Valuable healthcare experience: This is the main reason I sought out a scribing job to begin with, and it gave me a lot to talk about in med school interviews. Within my first 6 months at Robin, I was able to scribe for at least a half dozen different doctors. I don\u2019t believe you get that kind of variety in a traditional scribing job. Robin currently only works with orthopedists for now (with plans to expand to other specialties in the next few months), and a variety of subspecialties such as hand and wrist vs sports medicine. I\u2019ve now seen many different doctors in clinics across the country and I learn something new with each one, which is part of what keeps me interested in what I do.\n\nLots of opportunity for upward movement: They recently rolled out a new pay structure and outlined promotional roles and how to move up. Management is pretty transparent about the whole thing and is really honest if you ask questions. I've been promoted a few times in less than a year of working at Robin, which I also don\u2019t believe is very common with traditional scribing jobs or really most jobs. And although most of us are pre-med and plan to go to medical school, I\u2019ve seen some of my coworkers have opportunities to turn this job into a career. They really seem to invest in their employees and want them to succeed. Also, I saw many people listing the wage as a con, but starting pay is comparable to any other scribing job I\u2019ve seen and is even higher than what a few of my friends make with on-campus jobs. That on top of bonuses and opportunities for promotions/raises makes me put pay in the pros section.\n\nFlexible scheduling: I started working here when I was a student and was able to work around my class schedule easily. You\u2019re asked for your availability up-front, so as long as you\u2019re honest from the beginning about when you can work then there are no surprises. After graduating, I was able to get time off for last-minute interviews or even work over the weekends or get overtime when I wanted to. They have really wide hours of operation so it\u2019s easy to get your hours in even if you\u2019re available at weird times.\n\nTons of perks: Free snacks and drinks that they restock every couple of days. All of the La Croix you could ever want. They recently switched to a healthier snack vendor at the request of the employees. They also have monthly lectures from people in the healthcare field including some of the doctors we scribe for, which I think is really great because we get the chance to interact with them and ask questions. Lastly, they host monthly social events for employees and have started opening up planning discussions to everyone and having polls for which event to pick. It feels very inclusive and I can tell they\u2019ve been trying to further develop the company culture.", "You could maybe say you're a medical scribe on a medical school application, but anyone reviewing your application with half a brain will be able to tell you never even saw a single doctor in person your entire career at this place."], "salesforce": ["Great Benefits, people, and the culture is amazing", "Salesforce is a destination company and there are few places where you will find so many truly interesting and gifted people in one firm.

In practice, not true.\n\n6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a \"con\" to that, too (see below).", "* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).\n* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.\n* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.\n* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.\n* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).\n* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.\n* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.\n\nNeither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.\n* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.\n* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance \"even at Google\" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.", "You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.\n\nYou'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world\n\nYou'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.\n\nYou'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing\n\nYou'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable.\n\nThere are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.\n\nYour pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.\n\nGoogle cares about how it treats its employees.\n\nThe campus is like an academic campus in many ways.\n\nThere are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.\n\nYou'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.\n\nIf and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors.\n\nThe company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT.
