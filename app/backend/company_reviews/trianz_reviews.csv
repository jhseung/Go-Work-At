Best package for the newly joining people if they know their market value.
When Trianz asks you to leave after blame game, they will still respect you with the notice period applicable per offer letter.
I had a learning curve when I got onsite opportunity where I have got exposure to lot of challenges roles and responsibilities.","Policies will be written on document and when it comes to action, lots of impendences than expected benefits.
Blame game is waiting for you anytime.
If you are in bench for 1 month or more, you will be expected to leave if you won't get into any other technology irrespective of your skill set.
H1/L1 contract is bait, where you have to stay offshore until end of contract and if you are lucky, you will get opportunity by then. Hike won’t be impressive out of your performance when signed contract.
There won't be any recognition for the value added to project or Trianz being at client place, but it limits to A4 sheet with your records.
Least hikes from later on till last day at Trianz for 90% or human resources.
Trianz doesn't have a view at employee benefit, whatever Infosys implements against employee benefits will be implemented in Trianz.
Lots of politics with Directors at managers who work at clients place as reporting manager, due to lack of visibility to organization.
One will get screwed if he communicated any without carbon-copy in the mails; it advantages the others to claim the credit of our fellowships work.
Finally, Trianz is looking at Fresher’s only to handle all project works and experienced people will be laid-off later once KT to fresher’s is done and completed, which is already in the implementation.
One rotten mango is enough to spoil all the other ones, like wise, one Wiproite indiscipline director is enough to spoil the Trianz environment.
Requirement from NetApp is bait; requirement is one technology and deployment happens into irrespective technologies.
Trianz has failed in addressing/listening people issues where the Directors just ask us directly to just simple leave/walk-out.
Trianz lacks in maintaining minimum information like intention of policies defined, maintaining appraisal data filled-in for review and while shutting door to any, they won't even check for gratuity payments if any are eligible in turn will expects us to remind after F&F settlements.
The policies defined for the current year will go through many changes very frequently in a year and this gets applied not for the upcoming future but from the last 1 year from date too. I am not sure whose failure is this.","Few of my experiences through-out my career;
I have been into this organization for more than 5.5 years, I have worked at both the offshore and onsite models, have noticed many thing where some are acceptable and some are not, but few of them are worst without any humanity at all.

You will be recruited for a specific technology and a skill set, if you are lucky enough to work, you will get the sufficient project, if company fails to bag it, then the resource have to sit idle for some time and should work on an entirely different technology/platform leaving behind the core skill set irrespective of people interest/feedback on the same. If you reject from working on the irrelevant project, you will see the director who will then ask you to take-up the project or simply walk-out from the organization. It's the same case even when someone has picked and tried his best besides lack of KT/information provided who will becomes bait for the reporting manager at clients place where we do take-up really challenging tasks and stabilizes it, and that’s where we will be blamed for something for their mistakes and they want to take advantage over it in securing their manager position.

In this company if you work under a manager who really takes care of the team, you are lucky. If not, there comes the managers and directors to start blaming you for nothing which reflects the hikes besides imposing a credit on you such as irresponsible, attitude issue, lack of communication, behavioral problem, etc.

Believe me, I worked for such a long period and I haven't seen my appraisal rating not even once besides after continuous communication with managers and directors. At the end of 2 or 3 months, Trianz fires the manager first and then the director so that the people salary issues won’t get addressed and the work will gets continued assuming the new managers/directors might help us where the will then be fired after 1.2 years leaving us in the same situation again.

You will be offered onsite trip and will ask to sign the contract, if it’s B1, no loss or no gain, Trianz will get visa done and its one's luckiness to get the trip. If L1/H1, contract is mandatory and if any signs it, then one has to wait till end of contract which is 2 years and once they feel that Trianz still needs the resource after 2 years from signing the contract, then they will process and will send you. Which means one will get eligibility after 1 year of staying in Trianz and then have to wait 2 years as part of contract and at the end of it, Trianz will think about you. The benefit is; hike will be low/below normal, he has to work for whatever has been told and if he wants to leave, the break the contract pay up the money 2+ lacs and leave. This is how the Trianz takes advantage over contract.

I worked both at offshore and onsite, having client's recommendations, I have travelled multiple times on a short trip. Later I have worked with NetApp where I had to face a different management entirely where the reporting manager from Trianz behaves like holding kerchief awaiting for the moment when client will sneeze to wipe of his nose.. One will be provided no environment information, KT or not even will be introduced to the team with whom we have to work with.. Besides expects the task to be completed in time provided no access. And when we provide any update accordingly, the client manager under whom I have worked is like Gazini who remembers nothing at all, who first makes an escalation and then will invites for a meeting. when we prove the issue is not because of us or there is no issue at all, its client's responsibility to clear the escalation off or the Trianz reporting manager who has to take care of it when asked for, who will just ignores it leaving our credit image to get damaged. NetApp is bait for people to join Trianz and out of 3 people who joins, only 1 might get a chance to work with NetApp. Rest of them will be on bench for around 6 months or so which degrades ones technical skills.

There is no value for resources in Trianz, when the person is into billing they will be untouched. And once you come to bench and company doesn't wants to continue with you, they will start the favorite BLAME game first, if you win or the newly joined HR wins, you have to resign by end of the day or you will be blackmailed by termination which seized any employee benefits. Later after a week or few days, Trianz asks you to stop coming to office after some particular day where you can stay back at home by offering a favor of not driving to office to and fro, irrespective of notice period which is still okay. Later next day, they will come to you taking all the office accessories like, laptop, access id, others and asks not to visit office any more where the notice period still continues although our mail, access, everything will be deleted. Trianz plans in such a way that you won't even get a chance to take backup of any personal information as they asks you to hand-over everything and leave office.

Besides all of the above, the approach how the HR does is the worst of it all; it literally felt me to think like, ""Is this the organization I have been working since all along"". They made my Full & Final settlement in just 10 days after my official last working day, where they haven't settled few re-imbursements, gratuity. Upon a follow-up, in return I was asked by HR, since how long have I been working at Trianz, that’s how each system is running and it’s the same since 5 years, later upon multiple follow-up they paid re-imbursements after a 21 days and Gratuity after 1 month by issuing a FORGERY Cheque. Because of this, I again had to visit Trianz and got another FORGERY Cheque. Later after 3 months 20 days from last working day, I got the amount credited into my account. This will be the same case with any re-imbursements made where we need to get money from Trianz. They will first delay the process for 1 or 2 or even 3 months if you don't connect the team besides the internal portal communication to them. Later it will get processed upon follow-up by 1 more month. I am not sure if the Finance team is trying to generate interest based on the money that needs to paid out where the finance team can show it as their performance to the Organization for their appraisal irrespective of person's need who filed it.

It's a body shopping company and you will find ex-Wiproites as directors mostly at 99%, where I haven't seen any discipline or value to the people from their behavior and the way they talk to. The directors will simply tell you to walk-out of the organization when you find any issue instead of listening or addressing it by using a BLAME game on us.

If anybody wants to join here, go for a good package, where you won’t get it later, forget about the hike, you won't even get appraisal rating at first place, besides many will start feeling like ""why I have joined here and what am I doing here""

There are lots of gaps between management and people, where the Trianz will never show any interest in not even listening to, and if at all, forget about the response out of it, besides you will be cornered for favorite game - Blame game.

There are few employee benefit policies in the documents which has lots of conditions to meet the eligibility criteria and if you still get through it, the Finance team will apply breaks on it, you know cost-cutting.. All though you explain everything in the document, they still need more justification to cut down 30% to 50% of policy benefit to the employee.

Few Trianz reporting managers at NetApp location are very experts in managing one’s credit be given to others and you will be given no hike, which ends at Blame game, this is the general policy across. Be aware of it!!! Although you have all the proofs to justify who is at mistake, you are helpless.
I do have mails, status updates along with audio recordings too which they won’t expect that with us.

Think where you will be after 1 year before you join Trianz.",2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

2010-05-31, Technical Lead,Bengaluru (India),Former Employee ,Worst Management,,0,"Good for freshers, they can enjoy life.","Project management mean, squeeze life out of people who can work.
Have more than 50% freshers in every project, to increase billing value.
This directly impacts others, they have to spend more time.

Annual bonus is part of annual CTC. If you resign before bonus is announced, your bonus is either deducted by 50% or fully deducted.

I got performance award for slogging in a poorly staffed project. The performance award money is 2 thousand rupees, which less than 50$.

When I resigned, they deducted my 50% bonus (which is part of CTC). The bonus is name as performance bonus. Those who were on bench for last 12 months got full bonus. One who got performance award got 50% deduction.

By the way, there were more consultants on bench than in projects.

Management sets goals, which are unrealistic.

They had a Product engineering department. Whose last year revenue was approximately 5 mil..
There next year target was something close to 30 mil...

So, don't expect to meet the target, which in turn means no increment or performance bonus...
Even if u get any increment it will be projected as a favor from company.","Be fair to employees, even those who have resigned.

The company definetely is not as bad as has been projected in some of the reviews which really is not the case . We need to understand every Company goes through good and Bad times. I agree trianz did make some mistakes in recruiting sales people which did eat into their profitability as the sales didnt produce the desired results.

Trianz is a consulting firm with lot of high end projects. Trianz was a small firm where I had a good opportunity to get recognized and to grow in my career. As it an MNC, I had an opportunity to travel overseas.

Trianz gives equal opportunities for all and respect their employee thoughts. They recognize my hard work, even when it comes to salary hike they look into average Industry salaries, experience and other aspects.

Growth opportunities both professional and personal.
