2019-04-07, Customer Support,"Columbia, SC",Current Employee ,Great company with great people!!,More than 3 years,0,"Shippo is a company where you can learn a lot, while growing professionally, and you'll work with nice, smart, and very talented people! My experience has been that the executive team, not just the executive I report to directly, personally want to see me achieve both my personal and career goals. In my experience it's somewhat rare to find such an approachable executive team that sincerely cares about your growth and will help you achieve your goals in the way I've seen it play out at Shippo.","We are a startup, not a large well established company, so if you're not used to or excited about moving fast with things changing on a relatively consistent basis you may struggle some. Shipping isn't the easiest industry to disrupt so sometimes the job can be challenging, but on the other side of those challenges you'll often find that you walk away with a significant sense of accomplishment.","I've had a great experience in my time here with everyone on the executive team I've worked with or had meetings with throughout the years! Laura our CEO is inspiring, kind, and someone who doesn't take herself too seriously so she's definitely approachable. Our President Simon is very knowledgeable, polite, and sincerely cares about the people around him. The executive over Customer Support Jeff is down to earth, very approachable, sincerely cares about the personal and professional wellbeing of those around him, and he works hard to try to show the people who report to him that we're all in this together.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-04-05, Public Relations Director,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,A thoughtful group of people who care about employee well-being,More than 3 years,0,"There is a big market opportunity in an exciting space/industry. One of the biggest fears in PR and communications is fatigue in the media for your own industry segment. A major pro here (and challenge) is not only creating the category itself, from a communications perspective, itself but positioning the company as a leader in it. There is a TON of work to be done here.

With that said, the environment is suitable for people who want to create the playbook rather than ask for the playbook (there isn't one).

Shippo was a supportive employer throughout my pregnancy and maternity leave. The company is also supportive of working parents and ensures that team members feel comfortable taking care of personal and family matters-- flexible time off, etc.

One of the nicest most, collaborative group of people I've ever worked with. Has dexterously done away with bro-culture entirely.","There isn't a linear path upwards if that's what you're looking, for since the company is still quite small.","Take steps to ensure that the industry segment doesn't become commoditized, be bold about grabbing mindshare and market share through sustainable, long-term strategies.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2019-03-29,,,Former Employee ,Immature Founding Team,,0,"1. Good product/market fit
2. Good fun individual contributors, although the retention rate is so low they probably won't be there for long.","Plenty of problems you should know about before considering an offer the following about the founding team:
1. Lack of transparency: A number of folks were let go without due explanation to the rest of the company. In multiple (too many) cases the reasons listed were completely fabricated and did not convey the truth, just what was convenient for the founders to say - this is after hearing the other side of the story.
2. Low retention rate: Folks are constantly quitting Shippo. Ask why.
3. Poor hiring decisions: In 2017 ten new hires were let go before completing a full year at Shippo. A lot of the remaining new hires from that year ended up quitting/being let go the year after.
4. Gossip culture: The founders constantly engage in gossip culture, once they hear something negative about an employee, they will use it as leverage against them.
5. Not feedback-oriented: One of the main reasons many quit at Shippo is that the founding team does not take well to feedbak nor do they improve on it. So folks are either asked to leave or independently decide to quit after a long period of being frustrated.
6. Blame culture: Founders typically blame their shortcomings on one of the departments, or individuals, that report to them. (They will probably try to blame this review on someone else).
7. Brain drain: Due to the low retention rate, little knowledge is accumulating in the team and past mistakes are constantly repeating. When folks attempt to point out that mistakes are being repeated and attempt to offer a solution, they are singled out as bringing down the team spirit.
8. Unfit CEO: The CEO never showed any real, leadership or otherwise, skills at Shippo - constantly engaging in blaming others and lashing out when someone disagrees with her. She seems too busy building her own personal brand and taking unexplicably long vacations. Her, otherwise admirable, public opinions/statements rarely translate to actual wisdom/leadership in handling difficult situations. After working at Shippo for some time, one is only left to question the authenticity of those public remarks.
9. Unfit President: The President has chronic management issues - he is a big part of why Shippo has a blame culture. He very rarely takes responsibility for his own mistakes or admits his negative influence on teams' productivity and accountability. He constantly gives the impression that he wants to know he's the smartest one in the room. Presidents usually compliment a CEO, not this one; he takes equaly long vacations and does not seem to stand up to the CEO. Every department he has ever managed has failed: Engineering (big layoffs), product (big layoffs), design (big layoffs).
10. Founders in denial: CEO & President have often said nice-sounding things like ""if and when the company outgrows us, we will step down and find better-equipped leadership"". Funny thing is, they've been holding back the company for a long time, and it was brought to their attention, yet they are still there and in denial.

Shippo founders lucked out with hiring good folks, so don't be fooled if your interviews go well. In many cases those interviewers themselves might be quitting soon, as evidenced by the low retention rate. Of course they cannot disclose that in the interview, so don't expect them to.

IMO most folks quit at Shippo because the founders constantly turn their back on those who built the business for them as soon as they ask for improvements that would inconvenience the founders or diminish their role, even if said improvements would help the company overall.

I recommend you do not join if you're currently considering this for a full time role. You will quickly reach a ceiling where you need either the CEO's or President's approval for everything that you do, and you'll have to decide between quitting and leaving what you worked on behind or putting up with two inexperienced first-time finders who are not willing to follow your lead in your area of expertise. This applies even to executive positions - you will quickly realize you are expendable the moment you disagree with the founders, simply because they can.","Founders should give up control of the board, bring in someone more experienced. Shippo has no real chance otherwise.",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0
2019-04-06,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Significant Improvements Needed for Long-Term Success,More than a year,0,Promising business potential and plentiful opportunity to find a place among their competitors.,"I had considered writing a longer review than this to share feedback about the executive leadership team, primarily the co-founders, but the review from 3/29 titled “Immature Founding Team” does an excellent job at summing up many of the pervasive issues crippling this organization.

For the most part, my experience working at Shippo was defined by many talented, competent, and empathetic colleagues I had the opportunity to work with on a daily basis.

Unfortunately, executive leadership had and continues to have no interest investing in their people professionally. They anticipate that you’ll come in and do the work asked of you with little to no guidance or vision-based leadership. Retention rate, because of this, is incredibly low and it shouldn’t be surprising to anyone within the organization that talented people are leaving on a fairly regular basis.

The co-founders operate from a very closed door, “top-down” approach, with the assumption employees will make up for their managerial shortcomings through hard work and a general lack of appreciation for that hard work.

Lack of product-market fit is another puzzle piece this leadership team has been unable to solve for some time. It’s unclear how they see this organization growing in the long term if they continue failing to understand where their business fits into the shipping ecosystem.

In general, there is great promise for both this team of people and the business they’ve built, but executive leadership needs to develop pretty significant self-awareness if they want to see Shippo succeed.

That success will require different people who understand how to lead, motivate, and innovate for significant future growth to be possible.",See above.,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

- people team throws incredibly fun events for employees

- most of the leadership team isn't as clued in to what happens on the ground
- lack of a strong middle level management - engineers that are promoted to managers or leads often lack any managerial experience and aren't trained to be managers, leading to delays and lack of upward mobility, strong communication, issue resolution.
- non existent issue resolution process. Occurrences that should have a zero tolerance policy are let to slide depending on rank.","1. Pick and focus on one product/market strategy - not several. The more strategies you try simultaneously, the more your unresolved issues will amplify.
2. Make the tough decisions between conflicting values and ideologies
3. Hire more ""glues"" - people whose core strength is that they are determined to connect teams instead of those who (intentionally or unintentionally) create barriers.
4. Hire experienced engineering managers - those that have had at least 2+ years experiencing managing teams. Without this it'll be tough to hire and retain engineering talent that can independently think and solve problems, and train others to grow within the organization.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0
