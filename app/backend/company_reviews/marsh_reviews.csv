2018-07-30, Operations Specialist,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,"Solid for the short-term, predictably frustrating for the long-term.",More than 3 years,0,"• Work is stress-free and it's easy to maintain a life outside of work

• An *actually* diverse workplace

• Casual dress

• Office is in Round Rock (basically) which runs against traffic both ways (if you're coming from central Austin)

• Solid way to gain professional experience for a year or two if you've never had an office-level job

• Vacation time of 2 weeks, 80 hours sick time, and 401k contributions

• Nice office with a gym downstairs","• Once you're used to it, the work is boring and intellectually mind numbing.

• The new head of office is laughably bad. He gets managers names wrong, has little idea how the office functions (and shows no interest in learning), and is trying to restructure the center to be more like a call center so employees interact with their direct managers very little and teams are basically formalities. The only time he's made his presence known is the complain about the office's performance metrics via email while he works from home or to make passive aggressive comments to individuals on the floor. Because of this, workplace culture has plummeted (only 12 people went to the company picnic, for example), and morale is at an all time low. Whether this is an intentional or unintentional strategy to manage people out, it seems to be working.

• This company does very little to reward people who take on more responsibility or do more than the minimum. It takes way. too. long. to get any meaningful bump in pay and at this time (July 2018), team leads and senior level employees who take on most of the work make only slightly more money than entry level employees. I have seen people get screwed over for taking on more responsibilities than be rewarded for it. If your goal is to make a paycheck and go home, do not contribute more than you have to.

• The sick time is generous, but the ""absence"" system is broken. Without getting into the details, it's only beneficial to call out multiple days in a row, even if you're only sick for one and only need one sick day to recover. I've never been in a workplace that had so many ""sick"" people disappear for long periods of time which is a major problem.

• Once they're out of training, it takes SO. LONG. to fire people for performance issues. This is obnoxious for others who have to pick up the slack of a toxic or wholly incompetent individual, and it undermines the authority of everyone on all levels.","TALK TO YOUR EMPLOYEES. Cynicism, toxic behaviors, and low morale can all be solved with a little communication by either explaining the reasoning behind your decisions or asking your employees how they are.

2018-06-18, Operations Specialist,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,"Pay is NOT competitive, Operations NOT a priority to HQ, Promotions NOT based on merit.",More than a year,0,"Offices are kept nice and cool to combat the Texas heat. Plenty of parking. Fooda vendors onsite to sell their meals every day so you don't have to leave the office or go out in the heat to enjoy a variety of food-truck style meals. Attire is ""business casual"" which in the Austin office just means casual... coworkers are in yoga pants and flip flops on a daily basis. Brand new electric car charging stations outside make the office look cool and modern (tho seriously, who in our office can afford a car that can use them?).","In my time here, I've seen the pay increased twice (but it is still FAR below the Austin-area standard for work requiring critical thinking on this level). Comparable jobs in Austin begin at $18-20/hr. You will not make that here.

Both times I saw increases take place in this office, brand new hires received the pay increase, while the company continued paying all pre-existing employees the former rate for MONTHS, presumably hoping it would go undiscussed and therefore unnoticed? We have all learned to ask the new hires what they are making to determine when we're getting the shaft. What this means, is that seasoned employees regularly make $2/hr less than the trainees they are teaching. Additionally, when Marsh raised the bottom tier of employees up this spring, it brought entry-level employees up to the pay level of the Tier 2 and Team Lead positions, and those tiered employees were told that a tiered pay structure would be announced shortly later. However, after a few weeks, managers have let everyone know that right now, that's just the way it is, so all entry level employees make the same as the tier 2 and team lead employees who have 2 and 3 times as much work as they do, and are required to train and support those tier 1 employees. This didn't affect me personally, but I feel the pain of my coworkers, and we are losing valuable team members every single day. For Austin, specifically, this company-wide bump is not as helpful as it was likely to be in many of the brokerage offices around the country. You must develop your pay structure based on the cost of living in each office. This is not a one-size-fits-all country. Different cities have different norms.

Additionally, this week, a new employee (5 months) in an entry level position was promoted to a Team Lead position, without meeting the 6-months-in-your-position requirement or even being fluent in their entry level duties ----- being chosen over employees with several years of experience who were extremely qualified for the position. The employee base has come to find out that he has a family member in upper management, and the interviews were irrelevant because he was cherry picked by the office head ""to be groomed for management"" in the words of one of our more candid supervisors. Again, didn't affect me personally, but I sympathize with the disgruntled and now job-seeking collection of upset peers.

The most hilarious thing that the management has done lately is conduct ""Stay Interviews"" to collect information on what they are doing right and why the tenured few stay in their positions. The interviewees were handpicked by managers to ensure that only those who ""love their jobs"" were questioned, and well-known in-house managers conducted the interviews, so no one was going to be candid or comfortable sharing actual woes. If Marsh cares, what it should do is hire a 3rd party firm to come in and conduct interviews with employees chosen at random to find out what the issues are, and then anonymously share the data collected with our leadership. That would be the correct way to do it. Nobody tells someone in power above them what they hate about their job. Duh.

The amount of time Marsh Austin spends training new employees is insane, because new hires quit as soon as they are off the training wheels, and the revolving door never stops turning. Most of the employees hired are 22-25 year olds straight out of college. They beam about this job because it is their first corporate-with-benefits job that lets them wear jeans to work. In reality, Marsh Austin underpays and overworks its employees, and is desperately missing out on what could be SUCH A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO WORK if the pay was adequate and the growth/management was being maintained by some kind of checks and balances / anti-favoritism system.

I would argue that more of us are actively seeking alternative employment than are not, using Marsh only as a cushion to get to the next opportunity. Why am I still here? I need the cushion temporarily while I finish paying off student debt. This is a shared story among many of our members.","Start acting like you value your employees. A Living Wage in Austin Texas is not the same as a living wage in dozens of other cities because the cost of living is so astronomical here. If you're going to keep your United States operations office in this location, you're going to need to bring all pay up considerably more than you already have, and provide a tiered pay structure for the CS2s and Team Leads as well in order to retain talent.

2018-04-18, Insurance Specialist,,Former Employee ,Some departments are better than others.,More than a year,0,"Marsh is a large company that belongs to the MMC umbrella of companies. There are over 60,000 colleagues in the operating companies together. This creates lots of opportunities to meet some great people that could possibly open doors in the future. Salaries are reasonable- not much different than typical market value. Their 401k program is generous, as they give you a standard 4% contribution on your base salary (without you even needing to contribute!). Job security was better in the past, however as things are changing within the organization we've seen layoffs and stream lining of operations. Other than this, it's a standard work environment. The culture is neutral, not overpowering but not lacking.","HR is truly a mess. I was offered an internal transfer verbally, and was subsequently dragged along for almost 6 months before I pulled the plug and found another job outside of the company. Raises are almost non-existent. Don't expect anything more than 2%, and in most cases 1% is lucky.

Some departments are better than others. I won't elaborate much more on this, but be careful when accepting a position and do your research.","Value your employees. Understand that people need to make more money in order to stay in a position. HR should really get themselves together, I can say the main reason I left the company is because of how mishandled my experience with the internal transfer was, as well as the bad increases. Outside talent seems to get priority, which is strange. Marsh attracts top talent within the industry and one would assume that they would favor their own before outside candidates.

Upper Management presence is sufficient and communicates effectively with office","Pay & Workload - have noticed many employees choose to leave the Marsh to work for competitors in order to receive any kind of sufficient pay increase and to seek more manageable workloads. Marsh states that they offer annual ""merit"" based pay increases but this is not the case. Often when you finally are deemed worthy of one it can be less than a 1% increase despite offices exceeding annual revenue growth goals and new business goals. Marsh doesn't seem to reinvest any of their profits into the non-incentive based employees yet the pressure to do more work with less help grows year over year. Work can be very stressful and often the expectations seem completely out of reach. Hiring is always a slow process if it happens at all and any extra workload left by a departing colleague is just placed on the shoulders of the remaining team who are already managing extremely overwhelming workloads. There seems to be a lot of turnover due to burnout of employees.
Insurance: expensive for being such a large company. Low ded plans are very expensive and the high ded plans offer mediocre coverage and no co-pays (so its all out of pocket until you reach your high annual ded). Costs rise year over year yet deductibles are increased and coverage is decreased.
Training: There is none. It's a learn as you go kind of industry. Can be quite intimidating but definitely makes you pay attention and learn fast. You must be able to adapt quickly, be willing to ask questions, work independently with little to no instruction, and not feel overwhelmed easily.",Don't forget about the non-incentive employees... day to day they keep your business running smoothly and are vital to the success of each office.

Redundant request from management, poor communication from senior management but also within smaller (10-20) teams, and severe lack of time management skills/organization on nearly all parties in finance. Resulting in unnecessary fire drills and long hours.
