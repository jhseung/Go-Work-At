Significant gap in compensation between the highest and lower-level (levels 2-5) employees. Bonuses awarded only to levels 6+ (director level and higher) ; all employees regardless of level seem to receive an annual 3% merit/cost-of-living adjustment. Growth is stifled by senior executives, going 'above and beyond' ones role is not met with opportunities for promotion, which breeds a culture of apathy among those who have been there for many years and pushes talent out the door where they will be recognized. They are trying to diversify their staff, but there is still significant room for improvement, especially at the most senior level. Differences of opinion are not as welcomed as they would initially have you believe. Very meeting heavy, more often than not too many cooks in the kitchen, takes a long time for ideas and decisions to make their way through the proper channels.","HR should not rely solely on experience to be the determining factor of compensation. Salary should not only be commensurate with experience, but with ability, work ethic and prior performance. Senior executives should not stifle growth: employees who go above and beyond their roles, disrupt the status quo, take on challenges, and show passion should be rewarded and valued accordingly - there will continue to be a revolving door for talent if nothing changes.

The company recognizes the importance of all family types and provides a comprehensive benefits plan and paid time off for its employees. They also place importance in investing for your financial future by offering a very rich company match plan on 401k contributions. They offer outplacement services for anyone layed off. The mission of the organization is universally supported by both viewers and non-viewers alike. There is a lot of tenure within the organization. Employees are very passionate about what they do at Sesame Workshop.","Unfortunately, it's a very top heavy organization with little to no support for middle and lower management. Star employees are leaving left and right because they feel under valued or under paid. It's a non profit but fair compensation is still an important necessity. External candidates are given priority for higher end salaries (sometimes way over what other, more experienced internal employees have) while internal employees aren't given a chance to develop or be trained to the next level of their career. There's also so many layers to the approval and communications aspect at Sesame. Things move way too slow to get anything accomplished. Managers aren't given enough opportunities to make their own decisions. Many employees don't have or feel empowered to have exposure to senior management. They don't feel heard until regular quarterly staff meetings which usually is too late. At that point, they're just angry and vent their frustration.","If you plan to bring in new employees to fill roles of current ones, don't beat around the bush. Give regular feedback on where you see the organization's structure changing or going. Inform current employees asap if long term their roles may change or be eliminated. In matters of HR, Have your HR department be more supportive and consistent. They are very systematic and robotic in their communication. They don't make employees feel as if they or their issues matter anymore. They speak of policies and procedures that have never existed and certainly have not been communicated. When it comes to recruitment, we used to find great talent quicker. Whatever the process is now, takes too long. Maybe that's part of the issue, we have no idea what the process is, if there is one. Maybe you should offer a referral program. Also, no one other than the EVP of the department and a few junior level employees seems to have a firm handle on the benefits offered.

A lot of favoritism by one manager leads to hostile department environments. Compensation is based on your manager. Some managers will give promotions and raises based on merit and will ""fight for you."" Some will base it on the length of time you've been in your current role, regardless of your performance, which leads to lack of innovation from very complacent people not wanting to step out of their comfort zone. Many managers also take their employees for granted feeling that they should ""be lucky to be there."" Lastly, there is little to no upward mobility.","Fight for your employees.
