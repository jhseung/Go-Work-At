2019-02-19, Part Time Courier,"Irvine, CA",Former Employee ,I miss working at Alto,I miss working at Alto,0,I was hired when Irvine area opened up so I was one of their first couriers and I really miss it. I loved being able to choose my own schedule. And driving was enjoyable for me personally. This was one of the few companies I felt respected and valued at and I've had 4 other jobs that all made me feel belittled or ignored. Jill was easy to talk to and took employee disputes into consideration. They also gave us free drinks and snacks to take with us on our drive which made it hard to ever feel upset or mistreated. The dispatchers helped minimize problems on the job as well. I think you get paid for your drive home too which is more than fair. Better than UBER or LYFT by a long shot but unlike these companies they don't hire everyone.,"I left the company because of school and I think they might have raised wages and even improved working conditions for employees. When I was working there, we had to drive all the way to LA which during traffic could turn out to be a 4 hour trip there and back. A lot of employees complained about this but I think they opened up a new office so you don't have to do that anymore.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Alto pays well for the type of work, however there is very little room for advancement of pay, so you start off more or less at your maximum pay scale. Everyone who works here on the front lines is amazing, you will meet some fantastic people. Catered lunches and snacks are a plus, but aren't what they used to be.","- long hours
- patient care is being moved out of state, despite what company leaders say
- little recognition for good work
- micro management
- terrible company culture

Alto was once a place where everyone seemed valued and heard. Ever since they opened their second office it seems like the staff located in San Francisco, who work in patient care and pharmacy operations have been forgotten about. Benefits have been changed with little notice. Pay increases have been pushed out so far that they dont even seem real anymore, with finally very few people getting any sort of increase, despite positive yearly reviews. Company culture is now if you speak up or share your opinion you will be fired. Very long hours that include weekends and holidays. At times there are not enough delivery couriers to make an urgent delivery so someone in patient care has to do it.","Be honest with the SF staff and let them know if their jobs are at risk or not. Culture here is getting worse and little seems to be done to fix it. Transparency goes a long way, we can tell you are trying but it seems like one step forward, two steps back at times.

They did a good job, at least in SF, of hiring great people who cared a lot about patients and pharmacy. I never went to Denver so cannot speak on that.

Working in ops isn’t a bad call center job as long as that’s what you’re looking for. Patient Care is salaried and Pharmacy Ops is paid higher than market rate.","They’ve deleted at least one negative review, based on observation. The negative reviews point out genuine flaws- the positives just copy/paste from the values from the website.

“Growing pains” are one thing, but in the span of one year, we went from fully paid lunch and insurance to paying for insurance and full catered lunch 3 days a week. The building got broken into. My department was created, then smushed into another department. I went through three different managers. Perhaps that’s expected from a startup?

At one point, four members of the 15+ patient care team were handling the department with >60% of the patients, and when those people asked for help from other departments, they were given people with no care experience in other departments who had just started at Alto. Crying is normal, expected even.

Plenty of genuinely qualified people have been let go. They won’t give us more information as to why, so we draw the conclusions we can. It’s seemingly because they challenged leadership and asked questions like, “why are we moving to denver when we don’t have the processes in place to make it work?” and “can I go to the bathroom without being harassed by my manager on slack?” If it’s not because of that? Well, no explanations were given, and people are scared of stepping out of line just in case.

I’ve heard things about training in denver- people who travel to denver from SF to train (groups of 5+) aren’t given resources they need and are working on the fly. Instead of going home to relax after training large starting groups, the training personnel live in one AirBnB for the duration of their stay.","Transparency. If the goal is to start a call center, tell your staff that. If you’re letting someone go because of a genuine reason, let your staff know so they don’t fear for their jobs.

- Pharmacy is an old industry that can really benefit from technology. Alto is already helping real people everyday, and the opportunity to change the entire industry is there.
- The company culture strongly emphasizes diversity. This is not a bunch of bros.

Leadership is young, but strong and without ego to admit shortcomings and strive to truly improve upon them.

We're building a better pharmacy from the inside out. As an engineer, this means you get to work on an amazing range of tech. Our mobile app and patient-facing dashboard are just scratching the surface. We build and maintain an extensive admin dashboard used by the majority of the company to do everything from intaking prescriptions, billing insurance, managing inventory, and contacting the patient. We also interface with printers, scanners, and medication-dispensing robots. We still have a lot more to do like designing more efficient routes for our couriers, streamlining our operations workflows, and building more self-service tools for patients.

Cross-team collaboration
Whenever we work on a project, we can tap into a wealth of health care knowledge and experience on the operations and pharmacy teams to inform our engineering work. No one is handing you a spec. You get to dig into the problem and work together to come up with a solution. Plus, since most of our work is in internal tools, our users are our coworkers. It's very motivating to drive impact for coworkers you see every day and know that making them more efficient leads to better outcomes for our patients.

Diverse and inclusive team
It's really refreshing to work in a company with a healthy gender balance, wide variety of upbringings and educational backgrounds, and get to see your coworkers' partners and kids around the office. I've seen critical feedback and great initiatives rise up from all corners of the company. We certainly have room for improvement but we're off to a great start.","Cross-team communication
We have large operations and sales teams relative to the engineering team and they're always iterating on their processes so it's hard for us to keep up with how they're running things at any given moment so we can make sure we're building the right things. I love that we're a pretty flat organization and that projects can spin up from a variety of places but it's definitely challenging to keep everyone informed.

Balancing urgency and excellent service
There's definitely a tension between getting deliveries out the door and building a system that can scale to multiple cities and provide an excellent service to a variety of patients.

There’s a lot of focus right now on performance. I think because before there wasn’t a lot of ways to measure it and now there is time to figure it out. There’s different metrics being spit out each day, hard to figure out what is important or if any of it is the right metrics.
Change. There is so much change at this company. What you did this morning may not be what you do in the afternoon. You may log on and not see something. No worries! Our engineers are always available and make this priority. They understand how important the software is to doing our job. If change isn’t your thing, this company isn’t for you.
Growth. We are growing at a really quick pace and it’s scary not knowing if the culture we built will sustain the growth. The good thing is that everyone is aware of it and is trying everything to keep the same culture.
Pay. We’re no facebook or apple so although the pay is good, we’re definitely working here for more than just the money. We see the vision of the company (and how it will change healthcare) and we want to be part of it.
Benefits. The founders are aware that there is more to be done in this area and it is changing.

 - parking can be a b*%^$ at times, #dogpatch
 - the company is addicted to LaCroix sparkling waters :)","Continue embracing the 3 core values (patients first, humility, sense of urgency).
