We’re listening to customer feedback but also balancing the basics with innovation. The new leadership team is seasoned and knows what they’re doing. Even more importantly, they’re humble and open-minded. Everyone makes bad decisions sometimes, but instead of acting like they never happened, the execs discuss learnings from the big ones at company all hands.

All the people we're hiring are smart and motivated, across all functions. Global expansion is happening quickly, which is helping us better serve markets where time zones limited us in the past.

There’s a real company strategy. It also makes sense and is communicated to everyone so they can align their work to it. Having everyone focused on the same objectives seems easier than it actually is at companies our size in a fast-moving market, so it’s great to see it coming together.","The only negative at the moment is that the passion everyone has for the company and work can translate into long work days at times.

PRODUCT: We have a very strong product (with extremely reliable backbone/infrastructure) in a large, growing market. More importantly, the product is actually valuable to its end users and helps them make better business decisions / build better products.

PEOPLE: I work with many smart, motivated, hard-working, humble people that I also consider to be very close friends outside of work, which is irreplaceable and extremely hard to find elsewhere (further evidenced by the many 'boomerangs' who have come back to work at Mixpanel after leaving).

AMAZING MANAGEMENT/LEADERSHIP: I have a supportive manager that advocates for me and supports career development/growth; furthermore, new executive leadership team is the strongest and most aligned I've ever seen in my tenure here.

OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH/DEVELOPMENT: There is tremendous opportunity to support cross-functional projects / develop skills outside of my actual role and to be heavily involved in the ideation and execution of solutions to complex organizational problems.

We have re-orged our sales team, pivoted product strategies, reworked EPD processes, and built a proper marketing dept to name a few . During these changes there have been good times and there have been bad times.

This is important to note because right now is a very special time at Mixpanel. The company as a whole is working on being self-aware and learning from that past. Leadership is transparent on what we need to improve. Organizations are removing ""red tape"" and solving problems. Employees are working bottom up when they want to see a change happen.

The one thing that has never wavered during my tenure at Mixpanel is the quality of humans. Intellect, passion, and personality are common character strengths in our team members. Those traits show in our drive for a positive culture.

This is not to say it is always rainbows and butterflies. Mixpanel is not perfect and we are still making mistakes. The difference of late is that we are accepting and vocal about these errors.

In the 4+ years I have worked here I have never been more confident in our present and future.

Random bullet point pros:
- Big career opportunities to grow. Work hard and it will pay off.

We have a large customer base, a nice office, perks, a lot of cash, and other table stakes that you would expect from a well funded business in Silicon Valley. We also have a TON of work to do, in a good way. We were hyper growth for several years, but then faced challenges scaling, and making a jump into the enterprise while fending off a number of new entrants in the market. It has not been easy, but this is normal. The overwhelming majority of SaaS companies go through this same phase, and only those that learn from challenges, haves strong leadership, grit, intelligence, and a cultural appetite for change and risk make it through to the other side. We can see the other side! We are building a powerful culture here, and we can now see the path to success. We know what we need to do to win the market, and are laser focused on execution. The good news is that Amir and his leadership team have done this before, and are executing at a frenetic pace. Gritty, intelligent sales people have always been successful here, and now they have the opportunity to not only hit numbers and achieve personal success, but also to be part of something much bigger. That motivates me in a deep way, and there are a number of folks here that feel the same.

The money was fine, being a top/valued rep was great, but I found myself bored out of my mind. How many times could I pitch the same product(s) over and over again? I decided to put some feelers out and was inundated with recruiters saying the same things (great culture, growing rapidly, soo many reps hitting their quotas etc, ""hot"" company to work for) Personally, what I really wanted was to find a SaaS company that was selling something interesting, a place that acted mature in it's approach to the market in general as well as to job-seeking candidates, a place where I could develop/expand my technical sales skill set, with great VC backers, in addition to all the cultural perks every company offers. Mixpanel offers all of the above and more.

With that in mind, it would be rather silly to stay at a company based solely on perks, and while I suppose it's a bit of a tired cliche, the people at Mixpanel are the thing that makes Mixpanel different from anywhere I've ever worked. People here really want you to succeed in a palpable way. That's the thing that's kept me here so long.

Beyond that, we have a product we can win with. Competition has leveled the playing field a bit in product analytics, but as we continue to listen to the market and iterate on that, I think we'll start to create more separation. In the meantime, I think it's easy to forget that a lot of the investments we've made are noticeable to customers and are driving results.

Anecdotally, it seems people are empowered to hit goals and are consistently doing that.

The people are Mixpanel's strongest asset. Salt-of-the-earth type people here that are as giving and humble as they are adept at their jobs. The company wide fantasy football league and company sports teams (basketball, soccer, volleyball) are microcosms for how everyone here knows how to work hard and play hard.

It is because of all this that Mixpanel has been the most fulfilling, enjoyable place to work in my 20+ year career in sales. The amazing culture of openness and creativity is anchored by the brilliance of its people, top to bottom. It's this very culture that has been the catalyst for prolific growth in 2017 and what will continue to serve as the breeding ground for big things in the future. I completely appreciate that there may have been past challenges but I can only speak for what I see today and what I perceive the Mixpanel future to be; and on both accounts, I would say we are going to see not just great results, but something special that will be an inflection point for the career's of all who work here.","I'd have to really reach to find something but I suppose if you twist my arm, I guess the bathrooms in the SF office need to be updated.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

Growth. The sales team has been in disarray for some time. The great sales guys have long left and the good ones are looking. I get it, if they can't sell, they don't get paid as well. I'd leave too.

Listen, there's a lot that is wrong with the company but I never thought we were frauds. Misleading potential hires made me feel like I needed a shower. Regardless, I must say that the concerns with the product and customer retention aside, what is of greatest concern is just the way the place is run.

Going through the interview process, I came up with a list of 'musts' and 'wants' for my new company. When I reflected, I realized most of this list were driven by problems here at Mixpanel. Given how helpful Glassdoor has been to me, I figured I'd pay it forward. So, things to be aware if you're considering joining:
- Be very cautious when all the highly rated reviews claim that things-are-getting-better. The translation is things have been bad.
- Culture is set from the top. When the CEO isn't well-regarded, how can you possibly expect to be satisfied. Enough said.
- Current growth counts. When folks talk about 5 or 3 years ago, that's a problem.
- Look at churn. If customers are leaving, not quite sure you can spin that fact.
- Average silicon valley sub-manager tenure is 1.5 years. At MP it was longer, then it wasn't. The mass hiring now is not growth but attempt to recoup all the attrition of others that have seen the realities.
- Micromanagement is how MP operates. Good for junior folks, not good for the rest of us.
- Morale counts. A happy hour doesn't solve it. Morale is as bad as I've ever seen here.","- be transparent and honest with employees.

When people's 'Pro list' with the company is about snacks, you know you're in trouble.
- I disagree with many reviews here that the leadership is terrible. That's not true. The truth is there is no leadership. The CEO's ego is well known and people increasingly dismiss his bully tactics. The rest of the leadership team has been let go (I assume because they pushed back on the CEO).

I know this is odd advise from a current employee but - obviously - I'm looking to move. This post is my attempt to take the high ground and do what I'd want done.

HR person made a comment at one point that they were ""trying to do something about the negative reviews on Glassdoor""

Mixpanel had a great idea in 2009, raised a ton of money, rested on their laurels, and failed to capitalize on growth.

Recent product releases have flopped because products are built in a vacuum without any consideration given to customer feedback. This has resulted in customers leaving the company in droves. If interviewing ask what the annualized churn number is.

Sales and marketing leadership has been a revolving door. Good people have left and will continue to leave.

-There is so much misalignment between sales members, mid-level managers and executives it makes it impossible to get anything done in an effective, efficient manner
-If there is an inefficiency or an area lacking strength, the company would rather procure software to fix it then just address it and seeks valuable feedback from the people it affects most; ie managers and sales people
-The C-level flounders in their ability to deliver on the goals they set out. After a highly publicized CMO hire, they have done little to improve employee moral, company culture and actual marketing in the space.
-Competitors crush Mixpanel in marketing. Mixpanel attends maybe two events a year. I see our competitors attending dozens of events and even sponsoring them after they have less money raised compared to what Mixpanel raised. Mixpanel is just sitting on cash when it could be used on Marketing to fend off rapid growth competitors stealing market share
-They refuse to make tough decisions on firing ""old guard"" employee's since the founder is friends with them. They would rather let these employee's reduce sales performance and moral than making the hard decision to part way with them
-Compensation is below market value given the technical nature of the product
-Equity is below market level given the founder's view on equity towards sales people
-The product did not accelerate feature growth to keep up with competitors in the market. It has since struggled to define what it really is. Analytics? Marketing? CRM?
-Promoting candidates that did not actually appear to be top performers, but rather ""old guard""employees who have just been there for a long time.

Management does not trust employees enough. The growth path is not transparent. Promotions can seem arbitrary and based on favoritism instead of merit.

2014-07-10,,,Current Employee ,"Hyper growth potential, hardest working and most ambitious coworkers, best product in the market",Less than a year,0,"Best product:
IMHO Mixpanel is flat out the best analytics SAS solution on the market. Other companies compete with us by cutting prices and resorting to under-the-belt marketing. No analytics solution can compete with Mixpanel's suite of offerings and new products are developed and shipped monthly. It's amazing how rapidly the product grows and how the product is often two steps ahead of the curve in terms of providing its customers with what they need before they know they need it.

Hyper Growth Potential:
The company is growing insanely fast and it's almost doubled since I've started, and I've been here less than a year. We have no signs of slowing down either. Because the product is undisputedly the best, Mixpanel will grow and succeed as quickly as they can hire and scale. Literally limitless growth potential. Most company's goal is to have a billion dollar IPO. It's not unreasonable to think that Mixpanel can one day have a valuation greater than a billion. Why? Because let me ask you this: What is the market cap/size of Data and Analytics?

Marinate on that for a minute.

Hardest working and most ambitious, but most supportive and fun loving co-workers:
People work HARD here. They hustle, whether it's in sales, engineering, support, HR, or recruiting. There are growing pains like how the training/on-boarding process isn't perfect (it's gotten so much better in the past month), but everyone is extremely supportive and you can ask anyone for help. It's amazing how often people will take time out of their day to help you with a task or teach you about something when they probably won't even be recognized for it.

There is a company retreat, fun team building exercises like scavenger hunts around SF, wine wednesday, and office hours. In addition, this is a company were people actually hang out outside of work, and not just to blow off steam over drinks. People arrange trips and go to concerts with each other routinely.","Addressing the negative reviews about management:
Yes, the CEO is young and this is his first rodeo. That being said, I am proud to be part of a company led by a person who is bold in his convictions and not afraid to say no to others. I think once he surrounds himself with others with more experience, he will be able to focus more on product and the big picture and not have to try to manage 10 different teams all at once.

Addressing the management's treatment of employees:
Since I've been here, we've hired over 20 employees, and only one has left that was due to personal reasons. Whether or not the stories from last year are true, I have always been treated well by management, and I've gotten lunch one on one with pretty much every single upper level exec. They are all brilliant minds to talk to, crack jokes with, and to just hang out with. We have company meetings where employees have full transparency and our CEO even has open office hours where employees can come talk to him about anything - Mixpanel related or not.

Long Hours:
Yes there can be long hours, it mostly has to do with scaling issues (when we have more business than we can handle - which is a good sign of growth in my opinion) or when people are working on their own projects/deals.

Comp:
For how hard many of us work and for how many hours many of us work outside the standard 9-6, comp could definitely be better. This is a very real topic that employees do talk about behind closed doors. Hopefully, we are recognized for the above and beyond work we do when it is time for a promotion or review.","I agree with another reviewer that there could be better transparency on stock options. I think this would ease any unrest about comp and future earnings- especially when one might not know what to expect comp-wise over the next few years (mostly people those senior level positions might not exist yet to to our size). I think everyone would really appreciate this, and could resolve the point I made above.

More transparency on career growth, expected earnings.

Invest in ongoing training and continued education for your employees. In addition, continue to promote from within. Many of the company's movers and shakers are those with extensive product knowledge - especially in teams outside of just engineering. The employees that work here are our most valuable asset - show them that they are appreciated, don't just assume that they feel that way.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Vision- The product is already light-years ahead of the competition, now we need the company to grow. They've started to hire the right people in management to grow this company and scale operations everywhere and that is what has been missing.

Promotions- Management has rewarded stellar employees and promoted from within over and over again. It's refreshing that, when appropriate, Mixpanel looks internally to build out new teams and fill new roles. Promotions are awesome!!","Lack of Scale- In the past, there hasn't been as much growth that I would've expected to see from the company in terms of employee count and spend. This outlook has changed and there is a definite focus on making sure Mixpanel realizes it's full potential. The building feels unfinished at times, so maybe a new space would give the company a cozier feel.

Fantastic culture, and equally impressive leadership team across all the geo's, but i'm most impressed by the product. This is a market leading product in a very buoyant sector. Most companies are reviewing their analytic strategy to help them better understand how their customers use their websites/apps, which will help inform them to make strategic 'data driven' decisions to improve them.","The market is pretty crowded with legacy players, and some 'up and coming', but this only confirms (to me) that this is a growing market.

2018-11-16,,,Current Employee ,Amazing Time to Work Here,More than 3 years,0,"It's never been better in year 3 of being at Mixpanel. There is more focus to the product, vision and growth of the company, coupled with the addition of charismatic leaders with experience scaling some of the world's most successful tech companies. Mixpanelers have always been fun, caring people to work with, but the culture has really improved in the last 6 months and there is renewed energy on the Go-to-Market team to make the most of the opportunity in front of us. It all adds up to an exciting year that will be surely filled with lots of rewarding work and the opportunity for every employee to make a significant impact.","It's not a company for everyone. There are lots of interesting questions to solve and the recent leadership and culture changes create teams that work fast without fear to make mistakes (something like 50+ feature updates in 6 months). It's data informed and intelligent risk, but it does mean things can pivot quickly. If you're the type of person that gets overwhelmed when trying to prioritize work or requires handholding to do your job, depending on the department, it may be too much. I don't see this as a good or bad thing, but not all working styles will thrive here. Those that lead by example, play well with others, naturally curious, and don't shy away from taking ownership do better here.","Live by our new cultural values and keep bringing on experienced, thoughtful leaders and middle managers to keep the momentum going!",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
