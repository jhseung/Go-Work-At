Office is open, and engineering problems are discussed openly with encouraged eavesdropping. Working in the office is much more enjoyable/productive than working from home. For the most part, everyone has a great sense of humor and a deep well of knowledge about random topics. You can bet _someone_ in the room has an intimate knowledge of snipe hunting in the backwoods of Northern Canada. Or demos for us the top 37 best ways to prepare beef brisket.

Engineering management is very transparent regarding company issues. No question is out of bounds. ever.","Years later, the monolith is still undefeated. Early Tapjoy eng created an epic monolith which years later is still largely intact. This makes for frustratingly slow development and lengthy ramp-up time for new developers. On the other hand, the operations team is incredible. They've taken the scary out of deployments and have given engineers the tools to see the status of the application.

It's also difficult to be excited about putting ads in phones. It would be more interesting if jobs were set up to enable autonomy and mastery. Autonomy feels out of reach with the current project management and agile configuration. The accessibility of mastery varies largely on where in the stack you work. Some teams have a stronger understanding of their domain than others and tend to be better places for nascent engineers to grow up. The teams that are strong in their domains also tend to have strong technical direction and are more realistic in their planning. Other teams crunch under unrealistic expectations.","I have some brilliant coworkers, keeping them engaged should be top priority. Employee motivation is critically important to performance; look for opportunities to highlight purpose, direction, and traction.

Training doesn't really exist for anything, the product and engineering teams (like most places) are so focused on the ""next great idea"" that they forget about the broken product they've put out the door. It's impossible for anyone to really excel at Tapjoy because there is no support for anyone. Everyone is left to their own devices. Title inflation is a problem, because those who know how to massage their way into a promotion get them, while those that actually work are passed up because they aren't ""visible"" enough. Pay is okay, however they look for any and every reason not to give people pay increases. Management at this company is disjointed at best, and works in a bubble. They are clueless to the ripple effect of bad decisions in the organization.

Tapjoy is also continuing to lose good talent. The employees are either finding better places to work, where their hard work and dedication are appreciated and supported, or the company is forcing people out the door. They have a talent retention problem, and the solution is to fix the internals of the company - not the people.

- Good work/life balance, liberal work-from-home policy in most departments

- Early employees are on their way out, or have already left. The company has lost its direction and creative force
- Current execs (bizdev and marketing) don't actually have a full grasp of their own product(s) and are changing the company culture from one that fosters creativity and innovation to a dull and bureaucratic one","Marketing and bizdev needs to be restructured, starting from the top.
