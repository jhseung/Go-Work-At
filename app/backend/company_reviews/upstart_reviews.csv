2. business - growing rapidly! Path to IPO is much more apparent than in most startups as executive team puts an emphasis on growing the business economically/sensibly over wasteful endeavors
3. mission - ultimately aiming to create a fairer system with respect to who can access credit and at what price.","sometimes need to take a step back and ensure the foundations are in place to support it in say recruiting, managers, systems, etc",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

2018-08-26,,,Former Employee ,Operations,,0,"Company Culture:
- Lower managers and the people here are fun to work with and genuinely good people.
- Lots of banter on the office floor which keeps shifts fun.
- The environment is relaxed, you can wear casual clothes
- Hours and schedule are flexible.

Technical Info:
Shifts are: 6 - 2:30, 11:30 - 8 for credit analyst. You may have to work a weekend day.
- There is a lot of contract workers. As a contractor, you will make $18 - 22 an hour. Once converted you will start at $23. The length of time it takes to get converted and the amount of work it takes to get converted will vary.","- There is a lot of office politics. Only office favorites get promoted or raises consistently.
- Upper management does not take the input and advice from employees seriously if it is outside their own opinion. They will say that Upstart is a meritocracy but this is simply not true. Do not drink the koolaid.
- Raises/promotions realistically only happen once a year, and only if you do extremely well on your peer review and enough of upper management likes you.
- Your workload will increase beyond the initial job offer but your pay will not. If anything you may get a title change and simply be expected to work more.

All in all, this is a great place to start your career but not to stay and work long term. I am, however, grateful for all the life friends I have made. Recently a lot of people have been leaving at a rate of one person per week. Don't stay longer than you have to if you can help it. They have been known to extend job offers for new hires and then take back offers last minute based on the needs of the company. Management has recently been trying to host more events to boost company culture and moral. This was after receiving poor results on an internal happiness survey.

A lot of those people don’t have a financial or startup background. Consider getting more qualified candidates and convert those temps at a quicker pace. It doesn’t make sense to hire temps that are not qualified for the job and spending time and money going through the extensive training sessions. It puts the company at risk and it’s more expensive in the long run. If the candidates have the financial or startup experience, they will most likely stay longer since it’s their passion and not just a paycheck to them.

- Amazing smart people to as colleagues, who will challenge you to work hard but also play hard.
- Culture is the best part about working here. If you ever have a concern, idea, or just need to talk about something there is a team member, manager or even a founder who have an open door policy to chat.
-Transparent team
- See many sides of the business which you would not even hear about in a large organization.
- Know everyone at the company
- It's very transparent with metrics on how the company is performing and where we are headed.

2016-04-14, Software Engineer,"San Carlos, CA",Current Employee ,"Challenging, Fulfilling Work with an Amazing Team",Less than a year,0,"I joined Upstart looking for a challenging startup environment with a healthy work/life balance and greater responsibility than I had at my previous company—a tall order for sure, but Upstart has come through in every way.

The founding team and executive staff are incredible (CTO in particular gets a special shout out from me), benefits and compensation are great, and the work is in service of a product that helps normal people in a not-insignificant way.

The environment is one where everyone is working as hard as they can to make good things happen—it's incredibly motivating. The company is small enough at this point that I can attest that literally nobody is a jerk, and everyone feels like a vital part of the success.",Office is a little far away from stuff (although there's a great cafe with a wide variety in the neighboring building).,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2016-04-11, Senior Data Engineer,"Redwood City, CA",Current Employee ,"Great place to work, have a say in the workplace, no BS",Less than a year,0,"- It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Upstart say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at (in the last 13 years). At a company wide-level, financial success & distress, public incidents, important non-public business metrics are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them and anything else (yes, nothing is Off-Limit!) directly to the founders, CEO, CTO directly at the weekly Q&A.

- One great thing about Upstart, in contrast to other comparable lending companies, is how we have a pretty singular focus ""to help people achieve Financial Fitness"". This sentiment echoes across the board...where we count our success ""by not the number of loans originated BUT by the number of people we have helped attain financial fitness ""

- Highest rating on Credit Karma and great reviews and feedback from the folks we have helped. I read back to myself, a new feedback everyday which makes my belief in our mission more stronger!!

- I own and have a the say in my engineering department which makes this a perfect place to work for me. Opportunities to grow and contribute are endless here and all you need is commitment, ownership and skill to have it....no BS or work-politics here!

- Finally, my yet another favorite: if you aspire to work on the latest and the greatest bleeding edge technology then this is where you got to be! I have been working on the newest cloud based technology stuff (IaaS, PaaS)...which is a great career development

- Great tech budget, fully stocked kitchen, meal reimbursement, no cap on vacations",- Need more company outings and social gatherings,- Keep sharing the company insights and involve us in all decisions (no complaints until now!),5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2016-04-13, Senior Software Engineer,"San Carlos, CA",Current Employee ,Great place to work,,0,"Upstart is a great place to work.
The team is wicked smart, great to work with and there are no ***holes.
Management listen to what you say, everything is up to be changed if you suggest a better way and more importantly, they care.
It's very transparent, you can see all the metrics of how well the business is doing in multiple TVs around the office, there are no secrets and everyone have an open door / open mind policy.
Dogs are allowed and the environment is good. No politics.
Snacks are pretty good.",Lunch used to be catered but isn't anymore.,Optimizing the cost of capital should get more focus,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2016-03-28,,,Current Employee ,"Governed by lack of transparency, lack of job growth, and big-office politics",,0,"--free snacks and drinks
--pets allowed
--friendly coworkers","--Management often talks about transparency being a two-way street between themselves and the employees, but that was never the case. Decisions are often made behind the scenes (about everything from new initiatives, new responsibilities, product changes, hiring changes, etc), then communicated last minute to the team without any discussion. The team is then expected to accept all these changes and blindly implement. While this style is not uncommon, Upstart makes it a point to emphasize their ""fully transparent"" nature, when they really shouldn't.

--No upside or job mobility unless you suck up. Management tells you to ""take ownership"" of everything, but unless you suck up to them, they won't let you work on meaningful or impactful projects. This naturally causes a misalignment of skills to responsibilities, as people who aren't qualified to work on a project will be put on it because of nepotism. If you aren't liked, you won't get any new opportunities.

Conclusion: Upstart is a startup smeared by big office politics, big egos and nepotism. Many join the company wanting to make a difference, but critical thinking and the courage to question certain decisions are looked upon as big liabilities. My advice is that if you're motivated and want to succeed/get promoted, you're better off going to another startup or a big company.
