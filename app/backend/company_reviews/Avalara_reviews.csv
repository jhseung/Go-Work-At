For a company with offices around the globe, Avalara puts a lot of effort into helping our teams work together to stay connected. Extremely smart and friendly people work here - we care about each other every bit as much as we care about our customers and it shows! We are encouraged to have fun, think outside the box to find innovative ways to contribute to Avalara's success. Avalara's software positions us as an industry leader in sales tax compliance - it's hard not to be proud of where we are today and the journey it took to get us here.

Recent improvements in benefits is a huge plus (401K match), moving to our fantastic new office in Pioneer Square consolidated 3 office buildings (to everyone's delight) and it was no surprise to me that we won Geekwire's Geekiest office award for 2018! We are finding ways to be active in our neighborhood and give back to the Seattle community.

My hard work over the last year was rewarded with a significant pay increase. But pay isn't everything. I feel appreciated every day and that my voice and contributions are valued. Flexible work schedules with opportunities to work from home as needed provide excellent work/life balance. We have a mentor/mentee program in place and new employees are assigned an ""Ava Buddy"" to help them onboard.

Our leaders are doing a much better job of communicating with our teams through monthly all-hands meetings. Questions are candid and answers are honest, which everyone appreciates.

Avalara is a great place to work. Can we improve? Always.","I've read some of the less favorable reviews and quite honestly, I'm surprised -- this has not been my experience. My advice to these folks is to speak up and make your voice heard. We are given every opportunity to do so. Be the change.",Continue along this course of improvement. Your efforts are appreciated!

2018-02-15,,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,Other reviews don't reflect the company I know,Other reviews don't reflect the company I know,0,"I get these Glassdoor notifications in my email. Maybe because I reviewed the company once before -- several years ago. So I get these alerts and, honestly, they irk me because they don't represent my feelings of the company at all. And just to be totally clear, this is not some sort of ""manufactured"" review, or written by upper management. To imply that all positive reviews are manufactured, or written by HR, or by upper management is total BS. In my time, the company has grown from 150 to 1500+. It is a very different company. That's reality. If people don't like growth and change, Avalara is not the right company for you. Period. But for every negative thing about that growth, I could name two positive things about how we have evolved as a company. I have no desire to go back and work for the 150-person Avalara company. We are better now, no doubt. We are not a perfect company by any means (though I have yet to work for a large company that is), but I think the company continues to make some really difficult decisions to make us better in the long term. Sometimes that means making some tough personnel decisions and letting some people go who are no longer the right fit. I can't help but think that Glassdoor has become a gathering place for the disgruntled (for our company and others). Because the tenor of a lot of the reviews I see on Glassdoor are totally inconsistent with the tenor of the interactions I have with people every day. I just wish there were more reviews from the normal, average, current Avalara employees. Because the view of Avalara on Glassdoor doesn't reflect the company I know.","Everyone wants more money, better benefits, more options and more days off. That's a given. And while I think there continues to be improvement that can be made, I think Avalara is making headway on these issues slowly -- mostly in competitiveness of pay. I think there have been significant efforts to get employees -- especially long-term employees -- to market rates in terms of salary. For a long time, we were on Bainbridge Island. And people took a wage discount not to have to do the ferry commute. As Avalara has grown into a Seattle and Durham based US company -- and elsewhere in the country and the world, they realized that salaries needed to be more competitive. I think there has been some movement on these fronts. But it's natural for everyone to want more. I will say that in the past, I have felt a bit underpaid and undervalued. Over time, I expressed my concern, my concerns were heard and dealt with and I think I am fairly compensated today.","I really feel we are on the right path and continue to grow and mature our business operations and processes. There have been tough decisions made at a sr. mgmt level -- and it seems Avalara is committed to getting the best managers in place. This, no doubt, is uncomfortable for some and unclear to others. But I think that is the nature of these kinds of changes. My only other bit of advices is that, as we have grown, we have brought in people with very specific knowledge and skill sets. Trust their advice, and defer to their knowledge. If I were one of the top executives in the company, I would judge my success (at least in part) in how little I second-guessed other people's judgements. If management does a good job defining the direction of the company, and the values that are important to Avalara, then trust good employees to make the right calls (and course correct only when absolutely necessary).",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Great location","I had a choice between Avalara and two other software companies. Avalara offered me substantially more in my base salary to join them. I should have known this was a red flag . In 6 months of working here, I haven't hit my commission and I realize why now. The training is completely inadequate to equip you to sell their software. Several of my fellow coworkers who joined when I did are in the same boat.

Just a note to HR: since you spend so much time spamming Glassdoor with false positive reviews, why not address the real issues at our company? That's actually your job. Numerous employees have complained to HR about their managers inability to function in their jobs and yet you do nothing about it.
Hiring sales people with overinflated base salaries is a terrible idea because it is so dishonest. I was blatantly told that I would be able to hit commission here and that is far from the truth.

I will leave this company as soon as I can find a job to replace what I currently earn at Avalara. I am young enough to see that I do not have a future at this company. Now, I totally understand the mass exodus of tenured employees.

Upper management largely tolerates the overall dysfunction by claiming that the company is a ""startup"", despite the fact that it is over a decade old, has 1100+ employees on three continents, and generates nine figures of revenue.

The office space is always warm and comfortable, primarily from the piles of money that have been set on fire: abandoned initiatives, duplicate efforts from siloed teams, bloated company events, C-Suite musical chairs, and endless hints to the elusive IPO that everyone expected to take place years ago.","Speed up the time to the IPO, not because we need the money, but because then you can cash out and move on.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

Let's start with the terrible upper management that is built on sycophantic and nepotistic relationships that have nothing to do with ability or hard work. Sexism is rampant, but not overt. Very subversive. They've trundled out some females for promotion to the upper reaches finally because of the metoo movement. It would not have happened otherwise. I can't think of one person of color at the top. Silos are chronic and therefore it is hard to get things done. No one really asks the customers what they want. I've never seen a real focus group with customers at the center, but talk is always about 'cult of the customer'. Decisions are made based on what the CEO thinks a customer wants or what looks good for the press release. One thing is certain, customers do not want to be over charged (and they often are) and they do not want to be sold something that they didn't want or need (this is common too). There are some employees that have been there a long time and they seem to be resting and vesting now. Waiting eternally for the company to go public.

You do the math on what a private company's ultimate goal is. They are doing anything in their power to make sure that happens, which includes not investing any money back various departments that are in dire need.
The lack of internal resources is only one issue that has led to that decline in ""corporate culture"" and job satisfaction.
The churn and burn mentality on new sales is leading to customer satisfaction issues across the board. With management now starting to move towards a micro managed approach, it should be pretty clear as to why job satisfaction in the sales organization has dwindled.
There is management that is in place that has never done the job and has no idea on how to close business. You have other pieces of the management team that are on a power trip and have no idea how to management and motivate a team in order to drive success.
As they push for that ultimate goal of what many private companies strive for, they are losing the big picture of putting the customer first. It has been stated MANY times that company first, customer second, and employee third. Not taking care of the employees that have led to the company growth could come back to bite them.","Do better!

Management clearly views employees as disposable commodities, despite the measurable and significant contributions made by numerous talented employees. Most of the highly skilled, committed and mission-focused employees have left. I have personally witnessed dedicated employees treated with indifference, disrespect or disdain simply dependent upon the changing whims of newly hired upper management. Management is exclusively focused on self preservation and the potential realization of personal financial or professional gain. One might surmise that inauthentic or manufactured reviews are posted in order to bolster the ratings and artificially offset what is clearly a downward trend. There are certain VPs/SVPs who are nothing short of mean spirted, malicious, egotistical, grasping and avaricious. Just look for the departments with the revolving door of employees who have taken their expertise elsewhere and left a gaping hole. The company has lost its way and the culture has devolved dramatically. It's rather sad, especially if you had witnessed the company at its peak, when there was a sense of shared mission and delight in the boldness of this new venture. We were almost giddy with the possibilities before us, and eager to tackle every challenge. That feeling is entirely gone.","Replace the management of each department and let new leaders with a fresh perspective try and breathe life into this company before it's too late.

Treat employees who have made significant contributions to the company with respect. Loss of key employees has had a profoundly negative impact on the company, so perhaps its time to stop and question why they felt compelled to leave despite years of dedicated service.

Everyone that I've met here is really nice and friendly and has a good attitude. The environment is not cut throat like other similar software companies.

-Pay is standard for a tech company this size","-Company is far far behind where it should be, being a late-stage start up with multiple rounds of funding (department structure, internal infrastructure, systems, general levels of organization, etc.)
-Poor communication internally across departments (even within departments).
-We spend more time fighting fires (often times ones which pop up that day) than working toward strategic long term goals. This is something you would expect at a 50 employee start up, but not a Company this size.
-Company negligently did not plan ahead when attempting to scale. We are using old, even obsolete systems, and trying to compete with other tech companies in much better places (because they planned ahead and spent $$$). Most of us are using computers which are several years old. Additionally, we do not use cool tools which you would expect to find at a company like ours.

-No free snacks or beverages (other than coffee and keg beer). Not saying every business should provide snacks and drinks to employees, but many tech companies do and it has become the norm.
-Company started in Bainbridge Island over 12 years ago and only recently moved to Seattle a couple years ago. As you may guess, this has led to a gap in the current talent pool.

-Company does very little to improve culture and employee morale, other than offer free beer. For example, the Company used to have holiday parties, but no longer does. Additionally, the Company used to have treats delivered 4 times a month to the office, but this has been reduced to 2 times per month. This is all coming as a result of aggressive cost cutting.

* Supervisors were crude and unprofessional. One would disappear for ""lunch"" with friends (translation: he would go out for drinks). A supervisor insinuated that he slept with one of his managers while at a meeting in Washington. A supervisor passed out at his desk after an office party where he made margaritas.
* Upper management was not interested in knowing what happened in Rocklin. HR said CEO would reach out after Washington was notified of the situation in California. No follow-up was ever done.
* Micromanagerial policies were implemented requiring a morning meeting laying out the working expectations for the day, a follow-up email chart documenting the work discussed at the meeting, and documenting the completed work on the emailed chart at the day's end. The meetings, charts, and emails wasted 30-45 minutes each day. It felt like a law office documenting billable time.","Kitschy perks like providing snacks, having beer readily available and making life as orange as possible is not a substitute for honesty, integrity, and professionalism.

2017-05-08, Software Developer,"Durham, NH",Former Employee ,"Beware Engineers, This is not a Technology Company","Beware Engineers, This is not a Technology Company",0,"Company has a lot of potential in terms of tax knowledge and products that could very well be successful. CEO seems nice enough and seems to care about the company a lot.

There's a strong desire to cultivate a culture (though it doesn't appear to be going well). Compensation is reasonable, but 401k is useless. Medical benefits are average.","The company has zero engineering culture and does not at all respect engineers's decisions and ideas in the ways a technology company should. Standards aren't high enough, tech debt is un sustainable including 2 years to rewrite one of the main components of the product. These tech debt issues are not at all either understood or taken seriously by senior management.

Petty politics between people who have no technical background running departments like QA. All in all the company is a small cliquish company that has no ability or understanding of collaboration.

Career development, even in engineering, is non-existent.

Zero bonus.

Almost no opportunity for growth (or management doesn't understand how to make it happen).

And, again, I'll reiterate a complete misunderstanding of how collaboration should work. Collaboration, discussion, and debate are ___ESSENTIAL__ to a productive environment. People should not get defensive over things like that and rather should be encouraged. Otherwise every product that comes out will be substandard.","Management training is absolutely essential. Many managers are nice enough, but many have no idea how to manage feedback from employees or at least communicate that feedback. They're also mostly young and inexperienced and aren't given proper feedback to improve their performance. In fact, I'd strongly recommend a giving evaluations to Leads and Managers.

Leadership was severely lacking. Products visions come out of a whim with no real vision, strategy, or even an understanding of who and how they're going to use it. Their concepts of design and UX is out of the 90's and no where close to where it should be.

All in all, company has potential but MAJOR changes need to take place in the executive ranks. STRONG Technical leaders need to brought in to shake things up. People who came in through acquisitions and have no business being in the positions they're in should not be around.

All in all, the company can be a huge success or a huge dud. It all depends on EXECUTION. NOT IDEAS. Ideas are a dime a dozen, the hard part is making being successful.",2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

That's about it.","Worst micro-management I've ever experienced. Which might not be SO bad if the sales managers actually knew what they were doing. Completely clueless. Their entire philosophy is ""dial more numbers"", ""send more emails"" and by default, you'll just magically make more money. A couple years ago, the company thought they were growing a lot faster than they really were and over hired sales reps. By a long shot. The entire sales organization has been struggling ever since. They had to let a bunch of people go, and created new (worthless) positions for other people they didn't want to can right there on the spot. But ultimately, it was a position where management hoped people would just weed themselves out. It worked. People were quitting left and right, while those that hung on (miserably) were given more and more restrictions, month after month, systematically guaranteeing their failure. Then they hold ""team meetings"" where managers berate their entire team for missing quota. If anyone mentioned the restrictions and how they made it very challenging to hit quota, they would literally get screamed at and told to ""find employment elsewhere, if you don't like it"". On top of that, we were consistently given fake leads then we would get yelled at for ""not working them"". We were trying to sell sales tax calculation software, but we were expected to work leads for non-profit organizations, government entities, utility companies, and a laundry list of other businesses that had no use for our software. For the handful of leads that were actually good, the majority would say they weren't interested, then their contact information would go into a list that was called ad emailed over and over, day in and day out by two dozen desperate sales people, until they demanded we never call again, blocked our phone numbers, and registered our email domain as spam. If people asked me what I did for a living, I literally told them I was a telemarketer. Morale couldn't possibly get any lower across the entire sales team.There are a few ""superstars"" there, who are force fed all the high quality, big $$ opportunities and are raking in the cash. But they are drinking buddies in the ""good ol' boy club"" with upper management. If you don't spend all your ""free time"" (what little is given to you) drinking and partying with upper management, then you are just given the leftover scraps that the managers BFF's couldn't close. While these few sales reps are blowing their numbers out of the water, the entire rest of the sales force was struggling to even come close to quota. Customers were constantly furious, because they were sold products they didn't want or need, but were sold them at a highly discounted rate and the only way to get the ""great deal"" was to purchase multiple products as a ""bundle package"". Everything would seem great, and we'd get them into this fully automated system, then when their automatic renewal comes around, their cost for using the products would increase 200%. Customers would be irate and threaten to cancel, but it was so difficult to undo the automation, and go back to a manual process, that they were practically stuck with the product. Either pay full price, or cancel and deal with months of difficult work to undo everything and get back to the manual process and get your books back in order. I could go on and on about all the cons and negativity, but you can just scroll down through all the other reviews to see everything else that's wrong with this company. As stated many times before, the majority of the positive reviews are clearly fake.","If entire sales teams are failing en masse, maybe you should look at the source of the problem, rather than the result.

Swanky looking offices. Beautiful facility.,"COMPANY
So first. This company is BURNING time and money. They then realized they weren't burning it fast enough and they still had some left, so they went and got gasoline to add to it to go faster. They will call it ""growing pains"" or whatever soft language that they want to use, but the truth is this from my observation that the company got a giant investment of money, more than they possibly know what to do with. They've set absolutely unrealistic expectations for so many roles. Expectations that leave everyone extremely and hopelessly stressed. From an entry level role looking up it becomes so apparent that resources are being so ineffectively managed. Many upper managment roles reek with inexperience. It's new corporate structure makes it impossible to get anything done because you have to talk about doing it for 3 months.

Telemarketing
I will be clear. This role is not Inside Sales. This role is telemarketing. It is not in anyway shape or form remotely inside sales. That is only a title they use to make people in these roles feel better. Intelligence is highly discouraged. This job is all about mindless robotic calling to the absolute worst quality leads. They want biological human dialing machines and nothing more. If the technology existed the will replace this job with a robot INSTANTLY. In this role you have to leave pre recorded voicemails which are horribly written and sound like they are failed TV adds. You are not allowed to type your own emails and can only send pre written ones which were seriously written by someone with absolutely social skills. Managments reason being ""we don't want to risk making any grammatical errors."" Are you serious? LASTLY the part of this job that is most infuriating and completely 100% counter productive is how your success is measured. In this role you are only measured on the number of ""opportunities"" you create and the number of calls you make. THAT'S IT. You can be the #1 Rep and employee of the month and not even have a single dollar attached to your name. You will become great at qualifying the unqualified. Making calls for the sake of making calls and setting vain appointments. Lastly your job and success is completely out of your control. Management will tell you ""If you do your job and work hard you will succeed."" They will tell you a thousand variations on how you are not succeeding because you are not setting your goals and that you have to do that to be succesful. This is their evaluation for everything. Managers basically plagerise and shove the book ""The Secret"" down your throat because they read it once. I digress and say the secret is totally real, but it does not apply to this and cannot overcome the most horrendous inefficiencies of what Avalara calls marketing. In transition, your job and success is completely 100% out of your control. Your success is in the hands of what leads marketing decides to provide or refilter because you have absolutely no choice in who you call. This brings me to my next point

Marketing
Marketing is so bad that it makes me want to cry in a furious rage not just because it's absolutely terrible, but because no one will ever do anything to make it better or even try. They will talk about making things better. They will talk about it again. Then they will talk about it some more maybe rearranging some words. But they will never do anything to fix it. So mind you SOME of this is probably related to unrealistic expectations, but marketing who the fate of your success and not getting fired is dependent on daily provides leads that are literally engulfing the companies time and money into flames by providing seriously ridiculously bad leads to the point that even Hitler was like chill out those are some flames. Marketing is providing leads that have nothing to even remotely do with sales tax in which you are still forced to call on by management. Yes, let me call on this non-profit, churches, government entities or just any organization that is clearly non taxable. You will be told by management ""Your job is to equally qualify as well as disqualify."" They are providing leads that you can't even call on because if the number isn't wrong, they are active customers, partners, engaged opportunities. You will spend most of your time duplicate searching And...let me tell you..your success isn't measured on disqualifying. Marketing does not know how to use their tools. PLEASE for the love of god fix salesforce. There is a filter. You could easily save the department 30% in time. And beyond this and the worst part, For some reason inside sales reports directly to marketing which is so completely backwards and counterproductive. It's unfortunate too because Marketing has no idea what they are doing. I'm pretty sure they'd be better off hiring Helen Keller because at least she could see as well as hear the painful inefficiencies that is inside sales. The worst part is if you ever bring up anything about quality of leads to management or say anything along the lines that you have nothing to work with they will say ""What would you like me to do...wave a magic wand"" while still holding you to you unrealistic expectations and telling you that you need to work harder and set better goals.","I wouldn't blame any failure on a failed real estate agent with a suspicious family name. I would actually just blame a failing director. However this is not the case because it is probably not any manager or directors fault. The problem probably comes from up the food chain. Managers and directors were just another set of people on the totem poll stressed out over losing their jobs with unreal expectations as much as the next people.

But my advice.
Managers should Manage, Directors should direct. All those in this role did was facilitate
Listen to your employees. Don't just go through the motions.
Don't recommend the book the secret for everything.
Re evaluate your metrics and what the goal of the company and department should be.
One on ones dont involve three people
Don't make your team leads do all your work
COMMUNICATE and be upfront and direct. Dont beat around the bush.
Encourage intelligence

There are some really awesome people to work with who are always willing to help. Avalara is a growing company with awesome potential.","Communication between Inside Sales and Marketing is absolutely discouraged- even though Marketing directly provides leads that the IS reps are supposed to work every day. There is obvious favoritism from management (i.e. there can be certain reps that have consistently low quota numbers 6 months or more and never have anything come of it, whereas a new fully hired employee can have a bad few months and then be dismissed for ""performance issues""). It has been noted in previous reviews that if you are generally referred in by another employee and are from Bainbridge Island, that you're pretty much set for your time there- I found this to be accurate as well. The actual job is stressful, they did change the amount of daily calls and so now it's less than before which is easier to achieve, but they took away the ability for IS reps to qualify 3 different kinds of leads that were allowed previously without adjusting the quota for the month. The office is extremely competitive and oftentimes when there is an influx of ""good"" leads (i.e. tradeshows, webinars, etc..)

And I can still say without irony, it is one of the best places I have ever worked.

First, as of this writing (mid-2015), the company is at exciting phase in its life cycle. It's growing rapidly, winning market share, and becoming a dominant player. At a high level, we set ambitious goals and then we meet them. It's like being on sports team during a winning streak--FUN and exciting.

It is part of what supports the optimism and energy of our corporate culture.

Finally, Avalara is a land of opportunity. There is enough growth (and change) to provide career paths for most roles. And the idea on which this company is founded, making tax compliance--administrative deadweight on virtually every transaction in the economy-- easy, automatic and affordable, is just brilliant. The technology is complex, but the value proposition is dead simple and obvious. And the market opportunity is enormous.

As Eric Schmidt (the CEO of Google at the time) said to Sheryl Sandberg back in 2001: ""If someone offers you a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat. You just get on.""

If you get the offer, take it!","Not every division or group in Avalara is functional. Some of the middle managers are abysmal and if you get stuck reporting to a disorganized, self-satisfied, prima donna, it will be hard to enjoy your job. This is simply bad luck. You can try to outlast your manager--eventually they will probably be let go--or make a lateral move.

The shifting priorities, ambiguous mandates, and impossible deadlines can also be discouraging. And if you get caught up in the competition to send the most 1AM emails, you will burn out. But these things can happen anywhere.","Preserve and protect our corporate culture, because it will pay off in the long run.

Treat all employees with respect. Former employees may come back someday, either as a contributor or a customer. We need the best people to build the best products, so every manager should be concerned with the job satisfaction of his/her reports and whether they are reaching their full potential.

Cultivate an atmosphere of collaboration at higher levels. Too much internal competition becomes toxic.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

They offer decent healthcare and paid time off.

If you're a friend, family member or a former business associate of an executive a VP or a manager then you have great job security and preferential treatment. Some of the satellite offices are filled with 80+% of these kinds of protected employees, a bit unsettling if you're not one of them.

Management throws out catchy phrases like ""ask for forgiveness not permission"" but don't tell you that it only applies to the protected employees and that all others can be easily fired the moment they question anything or step out of line in any way.

The company has decent branding of its products but competitors are starting to catch up.

Marketing works very hard to constantly find and bury any negative feedback about the company and it's products. So there's a constant churn of new naive employees, some of whom can survive if they don't ask questions, don't make any suggestions and follow orders unquestionably.

The company has lured quite a few investors into believing in the value and vision painted by the company so there's a decent amount of funding for the lavish parties and special ""business"" trips taken by management (and strategic alliance managers) with their certain strategic partners.","Don’t be misled by the ‘seemingly’ high rating of both the company and the CEO on Glassdoor. There are good companies out there that truly care about their employees. Avalara (at the time of this review) is currently not one of them.

- The company does not care about the employees but misleads them into thinking that their opinions actually matter.

- Heavy cronyism and protectionism of friends, family & former business associates of: executives, VPs and managers. Employees that are in this category have great job security without having to perform.

- Even mid-level managers have carte blanche to fire employees without question or repercussions from upper management or HR.

- The constant churn (hiring and firing) of employees causes very low morale on some teams. There's a constant ebb and flow of low morale moving across various teams at all times.

- Customer experience during implementation process has been mediocre at times.

- Customers have mentioned their dissatisfaction with the support and the customer service and would switch to a competitive solution if there were better options.

- Unclear ""rules of engagement across teams and departments"" causes turmoil and confusion regarding duties, responsibilities and (for the sales teams) who should work various leads.

- Certain midlevel managers don't see the value of having the reseller channel and have voiced their vision of a completely direct sales model in the future.

- Reseller channels are fed-up with the company being so aggressive and have been flocking to alternative solutions.","Show some integrity. It's ok that you don't care about the employees, other mediocre companies don't care either, but stop misleading them into thinking that you actually do care and that their opinions matter.

Also only hire friends, family and former business associates of your executives, VPs and managers since those are the only employees that will have job security and success. It'll reduce your employee churn as well.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Working here has been an amazing experience for many reasons. Most of all, it is the people. There are an unusually high amount of educated, intellectually curious and committed folks who make work stimulating and rewarding. The managers have achieved that perfect balance of being there to support you while giving you the room to develop your skills and empower you to achieve your goals. The culture is definitely focused on putting the customer first, so that often involves long hours to achieve the desired result, but when everyone is working with equal dedication, it does not seem burdensome. The company executives successfully straddle their dual role of creating a fun place to work, imbuing a sense of levity where possible, while remaining focused on the company's mission. In most cases, executive level managers are accessible, approachable and more than willing to listen to any member of the organization. If you are looking for more than a ""job"" and want to be part of something that is on a fast track to even greater success, then this is the place for you. If you are achievement oriented and accept nothing short of excellence in all you do, then you will thrive at Avalara.","More progressive HR initiatives would be welcome - such as giving FitBits to employees, providing opportunities to learn more about the functions of other departments, enabling employees to reward other employees who go above and beyond - programs of that nature.",Stay the course.

Avalarians bleed orange! Working here has a sense of community unlike any other place I've worked. It is not purely the color of our t-shirts (and watches, shoes, bags, pants...underwear!) but also the fact that there is a never ending sense of collaboration and cooperation across peers, teams, departments. This also extends across levels from individuals to senior management. I've never been afraid to walk into a CxO's/VPs office, say hello and let him/her know whats going on with my work. The best part is - everyone genuinely wants to succeed and see others succeed as well. With a company growing this fast there are endless opportunities for growth- I personally am allowed to take on a number of special projects each year that have really helped me learn about the business, grow professionally and personally. This is also the first place where I actually enjoy spending time with coworkers outside of the office, there are sports teams, trivia teams, fantasy teams, we even have our own ROCK BAND! Now thats cool!

From a product perspective our direction is really clear - transactional tax world domination! We have been acquiring content and technology in a very focused fashion to flush out our product suite. Over the next couple years our stack of products will be wide AND deep. The opportunities to grow in the market have been clearly defined and we are going aggressively after them.

On a personal note - I had a number of really tough family situations since I joined Avalara. I've never felt more supported anywhere. Everyone really does care and understands that having a happy/stable home life makes you better at work. Times were tough and my co-workers and boss really stepped up and supported me. I don't know that I'll ever find that somewhere else, it's probably the number one most important thing for me.","Work-life balance is OK. Not because management doesn't understand that we all have personal lives, but purely cause there is SO MUCH work to be done. It's a good problem to have and is really to be expected at a fast growing start-up. You really have to set your own boundaries, and if you work hard and put in the effort, you will find that limits are respected. Some days are 12-14 hours long, others we all stop early and have a beer together.

Transition times are tough - and we are currently becoming bigger... faster than ever. I think most employees get this - but some employees don't understand why this or that isn't getting attention.

Overt sexism. Working here is not for the faint of heart. High employee churn occurs because management considered workers to be disposable and condones toxic management styles.

No 401k match. Stock options take forever to vest, if you are lucky enough to receive them.

Most departments do not receive bonuses or pay raises (I know one employee who has been with the company for 8+ years and has had the same salary for 4+ years), and performance reviews are a joke.

Nepotism is rampant. Upper management will pick favorites and then continually promote those people, despite the fact that they are completely unsuited for the roles. Relatives and friends are also hired and given preferential treatment.

For the majority of employees, you'll be working on Bainbridge Island, which adds an hour each way to your commute. I know quite a few people that want to transfer to the Seattle office, but space is limited and most end up stuck on Bainbridge.

Middle management, while nice people for the most part, are generally unsuited for their roles. This goes back to the nepotism comment above.

Your coworkers are typically just there to get a paycheck and/or experience, and most are looking for better jobs.

Avalara asks hew hires to write them favorable reviews on Glassdoor, which is why most of the reviews here are quite positive. If you are thinking of working at Avalara, I would definitely take time to read through the reviews, it should be pretty easy to recognize which ones were written by people that literally just started working here.

Before HR started asking new hires to do so, the company's ratings were considerably worse (which is why HR started asking in the first place).","If you have 18-20% turnover, most of it voluntary, it's not because you are hiring people that ""aren't a culture fit"", it's because you don't pay people enough.
