I am both a former and current employee of The Joint as I started my practice of chiropractic at a different location than I currently work. I started with The Joint right out of school and after 2 years decided I wanted to check out other options for practice in the chiropractic profession. I was deeply disappointed. So, after a year of what I like to call “soul searching,” I found my way back to The Joint in Greenville, SC on Woodruff Rd. I love what I do, I love my employer, I love the people I work with, and I love our patients! My favorite thing about working at The Joint is our mission: to improve quality of life through routine and affordable chiropractic care. I believe EVERYONE needs chiropractic care and my heart is that everyone has access to affordable care and that is exactly what The Joint provides.","The only potential “con” of working at The Joint is that there is a large misconception of what exactly it is that we do to make it so affordable. In the chiropractic community the misconception is that at The Joint we have a lower standard of care. I can tell you from experience that this is false. In fact, I believe we have an even higher standard of care than most privately owned and operated offices. We have an amazing compliance team that does an excellent job of making sure that we stay up to date with all the laws and that our patient notes are adequate and complete.","If you want to be the best, work with the best!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
