- Good top level exec leaders
- People are generally inoffensive","- Engineers don't match Tier 1 company caliber. They don't care if you do something right, just that it gets done and shipped. I haven't yet met a truly passionate individual who I can learn from
- Engineers look out for themselves. They won't go out of their way to help you. It's each one for themselves
- Managers don't care about your career growth or learning or you as an individual - only if you have delivered on your OKRs. They provide almost no support in career development. As long as you get your work done, that's good enough for them.
- Management counts on one or two individuals to do all the work. The rest of us are backup dancers, figuratively speaking
- Lack of clear future looking goals and vision. C suite level leaders are good, but mid to low level management is overworked, lack direction, lack transparency, and is totally uninspiring

The first thing the recruiter told me when I asked about what Opendoor was like was this, ""everyone is really smart and works really hard."" She couldn't have been more right. I'd add on there that everyone is really smart and incredibly humble and interested in new ideas and expertise.

Great Mission
What we're doing is incredibly challenging and amazingly focused on the mission of empowering people to move. People are focused and passionate about making the home buying and selling process much easier.

Nimble
People are not afraid to make mistakes and be nimble, which is mission critical in a company at this stage.

Data Driven
We're a company founded on data, and while at times the data can be overwhelming, using data to support decisions and ideas is critical.

Implementation of Feedback
Feedback is encouraged, and better than that, embraced. For example, folks have been asking for more training and development. The Head of People took that to heart and was pretty quick to open up the role, to which I as lucky enough to be the right fit to lead our Learning & Development efforts.","Work/life Balance
This varies by team and by office. In some cases it's quite challenging. There is a personal component that can come into play and cause some of this imbalance. That said, if you set boundaries, they are respected and appreciated.

Communication and Change Management
A bit of this is to be expected for the stage of the company. What worked for communication and pushing change with 100 employees doesn't work as well as you have more than 500. Leaders are certainly moving in the right direction with how they're managing any change (which loads of change is to be expected in a late stage start up). Communication is a bit challenging as the org structure is complex and it's not always clear who to communicate to about what.","1) Celebrate examples of work/life balance - there can be a tendency to celebrate heroic efforts, which can inadvertently encourage other heroic efforts of folks working on their days off, while on vacation, etc.

2) Add people representation to company values - the values are product and customer focused and believe we'd benefit from a company value that highlights/promotes employee communication, teamwork, etc.

3) Continue working on job families and the process for internal transfers - people are hungry for career pathing and it can be unclear when people are plugged into roles and others would have liked to have given an opportunity for the role.

The overall company culture is very progressive and inclusive of people from all walks of life. The CEO is a true leader and well respected.","An unfortunate divide has been emerging between ""upper level"" management in San Francisco HQ and the actual ""on the ground"" operations in the local markets. Residential real estate is an intense business - a common adage is that a home is the single biggest purchase or sale most people will ever make. While the traditional process can definitely be streamlined it cannot and should not be cut to ""bare bones"" service by stretching the operations teams far, far beyond capacity. The company seems to suddenly be comfortable offering a trimmed down, discounted level of service in exchange for tremendous investment in all sorts of typical Silicon Valley ""moonshot"" type ideas. There seem to be entire teams working on white board discussing theoretical businesses that might be a possibility in 2023. But we're not making it that far if the current approach continues. Impressive growth only matters if we're delivering a half decent product. Basically, there's an imbalance between what seem to be high-level Silicon Valley dreamers with impressive degrees, and people actually doing the real work.","This company was built upon a positive, inclusive mindset where all employees were valued for their own unique contributions. You're losing this, and we're drifting into tech bro land. The overall demeanor expressed by some of the HQ types when they travel to local markets is a little gross and elitist and needs to be checked. You have people in those markets working 12+ hour days just about every day - be respectful and appreciative, not distant and oddly patronizing. Or, you know, just don't visit at all. Invest more in your local teams, and significantly less in company travel for a select few (the company travel at this company is weird, I've never seen anything like it and I've worked in a number of corporate settings and industries).

2018-01-10,,"Scottsdale, AZ",Former Employee ,A Company That Doesn’t Have Your Back,More than 8 years,0,"- I had the privilege of working with some of the most intelligent and hard working individuals to ever come across professionally. Some extremely innovative persons, who are and were willing to making Opendoor into the the thriving company I ONCE believed it could have been. Unfortunately that changed in a matter of days and following some pretty inhumane behavior.

- Initially perks started out great; uber, growth, health & wellness - this was essentially to recruit as many people as possible but once the seats were filled, and teams were established, all the perks went out the window.","- Very self centered environment - if you’re not based or flown out from the SF office, with some prestige college on your resume, you really don’t matter and that was felt across multiple teams.

- There was no professional growth, at all - no real road map for individuals within the company, very stagnant.

- Every man for themselves type vibe & was extremely hard to work in teams on projects because essentially your idea had to be the best and everyone else sucked.

- You let an entire team go, along with their management, and they only explanation that was given was, “We’re going in a different direction for 2018” - which from what I hear, hasn’t been going too well and it’s even more of a shiz show more than ever.

- Upper management does not have your back! At. All. When concerns were brought to higher up, I was told, “Don’t worry about it, you’re fine - we will cross that bridge when we get there.” Two days later, an entire team that was over performing, was let go for no logical explanation. How about you hold your operations team accountable for having such “low & attainable” goal numbers, that were continuously met! Biggest stab in the back by far.","- Think about your customers! Stop trying to automate everything & outsource. It clearly didn’t work when you slashed the whole Sales team, and appointments were being self schedule by customers, who then never received calls.

- Hire management that have the skills AND background to develop your teams collectively and individually.

- Don’t continue to screw over your employees who put in their blood, sweat, and tears to make your product great.

- Also, next time before you so easily dispose of an entire team, have the decency to at least wait a couple days before making everyone else post about current job openings that those previous employees were more than capable of doing & would have done so happily. It wouldn’t have been hard to place them elsewhere in the company.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

High impact: there is potential to disrupt a severely antiquated industry and make one of the most stressful transactions a lot easier.
Fast-paced and lots of ownership, sometimes by necessity as the company is still relatively small with a lot that it is trying to do
Fiscal responsibility: The company is focused on the long-term and building a sustainable business instead of chasing small short-term wins.

Free lunch doesn't make up for the fact that you're under paid.
""We're a startup"" Is the excuse for everything. How long can you actually be a startup anyway? Just a word of advice, calling your self a startup makes you seem inexperienced to industry peers.
The SF office has a reputation of a ""you can't sit with us"" mentality.
Pay was slashed, I brought it up and was told ""You should focus on doing what's best for Opendoor."" Huh? I can't pay my mortgage with ""experience"".","I don't understand why a bunch of SF nerds straight out of college were put in charge of millions of dollars of investor money.

If I were an investor, I would take a long hard look at what's happening behind the scenes. Most of the upper management don't even own homes or know anything about them. They just want to be the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerburg.

Management is terrible. They are overpaid and underpay their employees. There is no support from management. Too many HR violations going on and there is no accountability. Managers can do whatever they want.

Although you expect structure to be different in a start up - there is no structure and big changes are abrupt with no thought to employees, like changes in massive procedure changes/job description changes, commission reductions, PTO wipe outs...too many to count. They try and fluff up the perks they offer like free food and free gym membership to cover up all the managerial failures they continue to do.

If you are a manager and overpaid and you love it. Otherwise you don't matter to them. There is no room to grow professionally.

Work life balance purely depends on what team you are on. Mine was extremely lacking.

I regret choosing them as my employer over the other options I had.","Hire an HR rep in every state and actually do things with the violations we report. HR should try and make this company a better place rather than a ""if you like it great, if not then leave"" culture.
Management should be trained and act more professionally and cater towards the individuals who want to learn and grow their careers rather than act like teenagers, gossip and do nothing except the bare minimum.

2017-05-31, Business Operations,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Tl;dr - great people building a company for the right reasons,Less than a year,0,"Just a few of the reasons that make me proud to work at Opendoor!

-The mission/impact: The classic startup trope applies here, residential real estate IS broken and Opendoor has a genuine desire to fix it. This makes it easy to come in to work every morning
-The caliber of the people: I left one of the ""best places to work"" by any relevant list and was surprised to see no drop in the quality of talent
-""Living"" the company values: Customer-centricity and empowering others aren't just buzzwords for team members
-Perks: While perks should be far from first reason to join a company, being able to get a car home after hours, snacks, the fitness stipend, and other bonuses are definitely appreciated and helpful","No red flags, but every company has areas they can improve

-Implicit hours expectation: Hours can be a challenge when there is so much work to do. There thankfully is no explicit face time culture but finding the work/life balance that works for the individual can be tough
-Feedback and advancement: When the company moves so quickly it can be tough to know what the job could look like in two years or what the expectations for performance are
-Analyze vs. Act balance: With so many smart people at Opendoor problems can sometimes be analyzed to the N-th +1 degree when a decision should have already been made, we're quickly getting better at this","Continue relentlessly optimizing the experience of your customers and your employees, the rest will take care of itself!",5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0

Real estate is a multi-trillion dollar industry and Opendoor has a real chance to take a sizable chunk. This isn't guaranteed of course and it's quite possible that we may only take a relatively small niche in the market. But I think everyone here believes that we could have major market share and, even if we don't, it's still a big enough industry that our business should be viable.

2017-01-21,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Fantastic (so far!),Less than a year,0,"I can only speak for the SF HQ, but here they are:

- Opendoor operates from a place of transparency. I feel well connected to other parts of the business that I don't work with on a regular basis. Company All-Hands do a great job of engaging employees and revealing any problems/updates of the company.
- High-growth but not crazy. For only being 2.5 yrs old, Opendoor has grown quite a lot. But our growth goals aren't crazy, as it's trying to avoid the pitfalls of other start-ups with crazy, unstructured growth.
- People. Everyone I've met has been smart, engaging, and welcoming.
- The perks and benefits! I know this shouldn't be such a huge deal, but they're pretty great! Unlimited PTO (that people actually use), daily catered meals, Uber credits, annual growth stipend, monthly gym stipend, etc.","Not much to say here.
- Office space. It's getting a bit cramped in 116 New Montgomery. We have plans to expand our office but for the moment it's really packed. Food runs out pretty quickly if you're not fast!
- Hours. In true start-up fashion, working hours are fairly flexible but at times overwhelming. It depends on your team and the individual, but it's not uncommon for me to get Slack messages and emails late at night or over the weekend. There's some pressure to stay later nights, but this is definitely up to the individual.
- Information overload. Opendoor teams use a TON of different tools (slack, email, Quip, Dropbox Paper, Google Docs, etc.). I think it'll be much easier moving forward to standardize where information is coming from and how we use these tools.","Not much I can think of, it's been great!",5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

-Culture: Opendoor has an incredibly contagious culture. There is a strong sense of camaraderie across all departments in all markets and you genuinely feel like you are part of one GIANT team.

-Technology: It really is a tech company doing real estate which means the utilization of leading edge tech is phenomenal.

-Flexibility: The company as a whole is flexible. They are able to identify problems and implement solutions at the drop of a hat. Flexibility also stretches across work/life balance which is hard to find.

-Fun: Every day is fueled by hard work and dedication to achieving the greater goal of changing the real estate game, but Opendoor never forgets to break up the hard work with a little fun and encourages employees to make the most of each day.

-Appreciation: I, personally, have never worked for a company that shows so much appreciation to all of their employees. There is constant recognition for doing good work and sharing great ideas.

The company is building and growing so quickly that the rate at a which the team is learning is super fast, which makes for a dynamic work environment because the challenges you are tackling shift week to week.

The people are a remarkable combination of very smart without a ton of ego and everyone seems oriented towards building long-term value for the customer as opposed to short-term tactics to hit the numbers. Most startups say they value transparency and honesty but Opendoor actually does, both internally within the team and externally with customers.

Everyone at the company works very hard but the company is flexible about letting people work from home and employees are encouraged take time off, which is refreshing in comparison to the many companies who say they have these policies but no one feels comfortable using them.","None really.
