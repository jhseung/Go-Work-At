You’ve probably heard great things about working at Cox, maybe even specifically Cox Automotive, and there was a time when that was true. There was a saying that employees were the “secret sauce” that made the company so wonderful. Great people, great customer service, great relationships with dealers and the biggest names in the automotive industry. What could go wrong? Unfortunately, years of rampant mismanagement, unqualified and immature leadership, no product innovation, rounds of layoffs and a resulting cult-like, toxic culture among senior leaders have drastically changed what life was once like at Cox Automotive.

To be fair, the industry has been under a lot of pressure from shifting consumer tastes, changing dealer demands, uncertainty around impacts from political policy and a digital revolution that upended the world as we knew it. Any one of these is not easy to manage, let alone all of them together and facing a company as large and complicated as Cox Automotive. However, the response to these trends and lack of fundamental understanding from those in positions of power have left the company and its employees badly bruised.

As the business struggled, employees:
- Suffered through multiple organizational restructures - often with thinly veiled threats from senior leaders about how easy it would be to eliminate their roles
- Watched friends and colleagues pack their desks through multiple rounds of layoffs
- Had their roles rewritten repeatedly, often expanding responsibilities and territories by 2x, 3x, 4x or more
- Were provided compensation adjustments that didn’t even keep pace with inflation
- Lost the opportunity for advancement because the organization was not just flattening, but imploding
- Were subject to political persecution, character assassination, personal smear campaigns and scapegoating

...and yet, the leadership at Cox Automotive decided that the those who remained were lucky to be there. For all of this, employee appreciation took place in the form of “pat on the back” webcasts from leaders and t-shirts with company logos.

The culture among senior leaders at Cox Auto is one of group think, toxic scheming, collective insecurity and frantic reaction, largely because those decision makers are so green and inexperienced.

Hiring, promotions, and advancing your career are all functions of who you know, not your contribution to the business or resume. Personal friendships and political alliances are prioritized regardless of work product or track record because a system of insider trading and behind-closed-doors decision making is the norm.

Put simply: leadership is inexperienced and immature, so maintaining power at any cost is always the first order of business. Positions of power are about all that the leaders at Cox Auto can tout - many are not authentically respected by their peers and pupils, and for good reason.

Executives have reorganized and realigned relentlessly, changed goals and tactics, combined functional areas, consolidated, and finally, made numerous “unicorn” hires from the outside: The person who is a “game changer,” and who will come to Cox and provide the “magic touch we’ve been missing.”

Here’s the funny thing about that: the company has hired a number of brilliant, capable people, but many of them last no longer than a few months. The reason? As much as execs say they want to rewrite the rule book and “disrupt” the culture and industry, such hires are met with closed doors and closed minds on day 1. Cox Auto doesn’t actually want to do anything differently - doing so would be a threat to the existing power structure.

New minds with fresh perspective are alarming to those who built the current system, so no progress will ever be made until there is a mass purge of tenured executives. Such hires have been made at multiple levels on multiple teams - and nearly all of them have checked out after getting a taste of the culture or being laid off as a “bad cultural fit.”

That process - the search, hiring and then failure of these “make everything better hires” - leads to the blatant marginalization of existing employees. Very often, tenured, experienced employees - the ones with good understanding about what can change and improve - are seen by senior management as part of the problem and generally dispensable. This is done to protect the existing system of alliances and friendships at higher levels - so that there is someone to blame for problems and falling short of goals.

A few years ago, senior leadership introduced a mantra they claimed to believe in and wanted employees to embrace as well: “Open, honest and direct.” It was launched right around the time that the business started falling apart, so it felt appropriate and appreciated. “Be open, honest and direct with your manager. Tell us what you think we don’t want to hear! There are no bad ideas!”

As it turned out, “open, honest and direct” was only the latest installment of Cox Automotive’s “do as I say, don’t do as I do,” culture. Employees who raised their hands with suggestions or constructive criticism were sidelined, alienated and ridiculed by senior management behind closed doors. Conversely, people managers were empowered to provide negative, harsh, often personal criticism of their teams. The policy, for all of its lip service from senior executives, turned into a way to belittle and devalue employees - but always with an underlying theme of how lucky they were to still be at Cox when so many weren’t.

Put simply, the current state of Cox Automotive is the result of widespread, systemic failures at the highest levels. At the middle to upper levels of the business, there is a fundamental lack of strategic understanding combined with a general attitude of distrust, self preservation, micromanagement and “protecting what’s ours.” Executives and senior management point fingers across teams, undermine one another, place blame and then pass this mentality onto their teams, undermining collaboration and reinforcing elementary levels of professional maturity. It’s toxic.

This created a work environment that breeds and rewards politics, backstabbing, gossip and alliances, while only inducing anxiety and loss of motivation on the people doing the work.“It’s not what you know, it’s who you know,” could have been written about Cox Automotive. Some managers even villainize members of their own teams to divert the focus from failed leadership decisions to “problem employees.” What happens once that employee is managed out? The focus shifts to someone else. The responsibility never lies with those in charge of actual business decisions - it’s always the fault of someone else.

Most unfortunate is the fact that HR is as much a part of the problem as senior leadership. At Cox Automotive, the HR team is ingrained in the oppressive “I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine” culture and cannot be trusted. HR will tell employees they “can trust us” and that they are there to help, then proceed to have seemingly “open, honest and direct” conversations under the guise of confidentiality. However, extreme detail is relayed to managers and sometimes, HR takes liberties in adding their own colorful detail and assumptions when doing so.

The turnover has been so high - even at senior management levels - that the company stopped providing organizational announcements and business updates for fear that it would negatively impact morale.

Most of the truly smart, capable, hard working people have already left Cox Auto (through their own means or layoffs) or are interviewing with the intention to do so. They know there is not a future of innovation or opportunity until there are massive changes at the executive level. The people who remain and are planning to stay there are either 1) part of the political problem, 2) tied into the pension system and hoping to ride it out to retirement or 3) new to the company and haven’t figured it out yet.

I have noticed that many of the positive reviews on Glassdoor are posted by employees who have been with the company for less than a year. In my experience, this is still a honeymoon period and well before reality sets in, though I hope these individuals continue to have a positive experience.

Your best chance of a great career at Cox Automotive is being related to or personal friends with someone in senior leadership. This will earn you an immediate golden ticket with promotions and special status, exempting you from much of what I’ve written above.

To those looking to come to Cox Automotive, my advice would be to think twice, network and do your research. Your experience at the company will be heavily dependent on your team: Will you report to a leader who believes in and empowers you? Will you be given everything you were sold during the interview process? What are your personal expectations around career growth and the future - and would you be happy with 50% of that? I speak from experience by saying that the grass is not always greener - in fact, at Cox Automotive, it’s not really grass at all. It’s a swamp.",2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0
2019-03-27,,,Former Employee ,"Kind, talented employees - Shortsighted decisions by leadership","Kind, talented employees - Shortsighted decisions by leadership",0,"I wanted to work for the Dealer.com brand of Cox Automotive for nearly a decade. Once I got in the door, I worked hard, networked with leaders throughout the business and found my ""home"" within the organization. I became a better, more analytical professional during my time with Cox Automotive. The people, the culture of giving back, and the opportunity to impact employee moral from the bottom up was inspiring for me.","Medical benefits are terrible. How can someone take care of their mental health needs, perhaps seeking talk therapy on a weekly basis (which isn't unheard of) and pay a $50 co-pay to see their therapist. Under the new medical plan I had to make the decision between seeing a physical therapist weekly or seeing my mental health therapist weekly. I felt that my mental and physical health wasn't a priority for the organization - cost prohibitive health care will lead to having less well adjusted and competent employees.
I was promised an equity raise in the new year after accepting a new role within the organization where I was making $10k less than my counter-parts who were doing the same job as me. This equity raise never happened and I felt lied to and unmotivated to continue going the extra mile. Money doesn't always ""talk"", but having emotional intelligence and directly addressing the lack of equity in my annual raise would have been a kind gesture at the very least.","Please focus on better change management plans and structure around change within each business unit. Making announcements to one large group of employees and leaving out the remainder of the population within the business unit creates confusion and a rumor mill that will tear down any positive aspects of the change that's been announced. Dude, this is business 101 - get people excited about the possibility of change and then lay it out.
Managers and supervisors are promoted because they're good at their current jobs. In and of itself, this isn't a bad idea. Unfortunately, Cox is now left with a population of supervisors and managers who are NOT emotionally intelligent!! It's bewildering to see MEN moved into director level positions who haven't shown and OUNCE of emotional intelligence. Truly a head-shaking experience to behold.
The GM of Dealer.com is a wonderful example of a leader who elicits trust, because I've always felt he listened to what I had to say - I'd follow him into ""battle"". The harvard business review has published excellent studies geared toward how productive employees are when they are being lead by an emotionally intelligent leader versus a leader with a high IQ.

When I started I thought I thought this was the company I would retire from, it was that good. However, this changed through a series of missteps and poor leadership. Cox Automotive grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions and did nothing to integrate the companies. Poor leaders were put in place and innovation came to a standstill. Then the reorgs and layoffs started and continued for 2 years (and still continue). I have never worked at a company with lower overall morale. (There are pockets of Cox Auto that seem to have a better culture and morale than others) This company has lost a lot of market share and still has a lot of reorganization to do before the dust settles. They offer great benefits, but even that wasn't enough to keep a lot of very tenured people from leaving.","Stop doing reorgs, listen to your employees, evaluate you leadership team - they need to be held responsible for their decisions.",1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0
2018-12-21,,,Current Employee ,Downhill Fast,Downhill Fast,0,Great teammates and decent medical benefits. Training and certification reimbursement is available.,"Started great, but now: HR is useless at mediation and great at misinformation. Constant churn of leadership at management and director levels. Decline in perks that were promised on joining the company. Work from home is a major selling point in their recruitment, but that perk is strictly at manager's discretion, so if you get a manager or director that doesn't like it, you won't have it. Vacation time moved to ""unlimited"" at managers discretion. Leadership promotions favor clock watchers and micro-managers. Team members are treated more like political pawns on a board that are ""moved strategically."" Strong, competent team members are considered ""challenging"" or ""combative"" when requesting more information or problem statements for upcoming projects. Vague goals and no definitive processes. Overall, the company is way too political and doesn't care when it loses top talent.",Treat the team members like human beings. Output is significantly better when allowed some autonomy and input to working projects.,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Management tells its employees not to discuss salary with each other, which I'm pretty sure is illegal.
Shady management. You will be a number to these people and nothing more.
They will lie, lie, lie, lie all the day long to you. I have had a few jobs and never experienced the level of manipulation and deceit I get from management here.
I could write a book about how lousy the management is here.

Additionally, the 2019 holiday schedule took away 2 holidays (day after Thanksgiving and CHRISTMAS EVE) and replaced with floating holidays but left MLK day! There has also been a hiring freeze for a while in several departments which include promotions.","Stop making these changes to hurt morale. This is messing with people’s livelihoods and affected work life balance. Taking away Christmas Eve as a holiday after this year is a very Scrooge thing to do. No department is going to let everyone use that as their floating holiday. If there are now “unlimited” days off, encourage people to use their days still as opposed to making them feel guilty for taking time off.",3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0
