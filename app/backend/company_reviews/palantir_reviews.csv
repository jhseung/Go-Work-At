- Close to the problem, great if you care about what you build.
- Strongly recommend doing an FDE internship here--you learn a lot and get an entire tech stack to play with. You get a very real look at what it's like to work full time at the company since they basically treat you as an FTE. You can decide for yourself if you want to return full time.
- I don't necessarily recommend this company to new grads, but I do recommend it if you have about 1.5 + yrs of work experience, you're a very good at what you do, have a solid value add (e.g. spark / kubernetes / containers / microservices / SRE experience), and are not shy about negotiating for what you want, and can strongly argue for ideas that you believe are right (without offending other people). =)","- Some incredibly incompetent people. Has history of promoting ICs with zero management experience to leads with no guidance, no support, and no training.
- Work life balance can be so bad that sleep deprivation will take a continuous toll on your health. For example, you can expect no sleep for your oncall rotations in BD since it will actually be 24/7.
- PD lacks good product direction. Great visual designers, but lack of product direction in designing products for technical users. E.g. not practical for product designers with no coding experience to be designing IDEs, etc, which results in some incredibly stupid UIs. Great engineering != great products.
- A lot of unhealthy friction between BD and PD, purposefully architected by higher management. Lack of proper communication channels.
- Selective BD teams have no idea what they are doing. No code reviews, terrible code quality, resulting in burnout/employees quitting from the absolute refusal to reduce tech debt.

2016-09-19, Forward Deployed Software Engineer,"Washington, DC",Former Employee ,Software Engineers - pay attention,,0,"Some (but not all) of the work the company does is incredibly exciting and impactful to real-world problems.

Your co-workers will be smart, hard-working, and motivated.

There's a very small number of companies in the DC area that offer catered food 3 times a day and have a speakeasy. The perks are real, and while they shouldn't be a deciding factor, they're definitely nice.","I was hired as a ""Forward Deployed SOFTWARE Engineer"". During the interview process, I asked what the difference was between this and a normal software engineering position, and was told ""there's basically no difference"". That response was untrue. I was further misled at least twice during the interview process, and one of my interviews apologized for lying to me during interviews after we both had left the company.

Any type of forward deployed position at Palantir bears very little resemblance to a normal ""software engineering"" position. Some people like the differences and others don't. Forward deployed engineering involves mostly deploying other people's code of varying quality and trying to shoehorn it into a place to solve a problem, then struggling desperately to keep it running. Also, trying to keep other people's earlier shoehorned solutions running.

As of my departure in summer 2016, the DC office still has no real SE positions, though it does list them as openings. Be very cautious applying for one of these positions. I recommend asking every single person you talk to the following questions:
* If hired, what PRODUCT will I be working on? (they will probably try not to answer - you can interpret that response however you like)
* How many products are developed in this office, and where are they used? How big are the development teams?
* How many product managers are in the office?
* What does the development/release cycle look like for the product I will be working on?
* Will I be working on a client site? OR What are the travel requirements for this position?

Basically, try to ask very SE-specific questions about the job you're applying for. Be critical about analyzing the responses.

But seriously, if you want to do software engineering, do yourself a favor and don't go to work at Palantir in DC. London, New York, and Palo Alto all have supported and stable engineering teams as of summer 2016.

The company also suffers from systemic poor leadership, which creates a political, distrusting environment that said leadership refuses to believe exists. This isn't necessarily a dealbreaker though, just something to be aware of. I ranked culture & values low, because while Palantir has a great cultural manifesto, it's almost 100% not reflective of conditions inside the company.

Palantir has a culture of disrespecting customers, which made me uncomfortable.

Finally, there's definitely a subculture of people expecting employees to be in the office a lot. I think even people who are on site all the time suffer from a public perception that they're not ""spending enough time in the office"".","Stop hiring software engineers to not do software engineering.

Palantir is a place makes the rest of Silicon Valley look like it is working on toy train sets.

It is a place that takes Peter's Zero to One philosophy and cranks it to 11. Here you will have the opportunity to help the great organizations of the world do amazing things - change how modern aircraft are built, help research cures for cancer, fight human trafficking, or deploy with counterterrorism units to keep the world safe.

Whether it is flying to the EU for a high stakes meeting to convert a major pilot, surging for 100 hour weeks in order to avert a client crisis, or facing a hostile skeptic that doesn't understand the value we bring. You decide your personal parameters as they relate to success and failure. Having seen much of the rest of corporate America, you will find no other organization that offers the wide latitude you will see here.

You will be surrounded by the smartest, most capable technologists and engineers in the world - who all genuinely want to leave an impact on the world - and they will rally to accomplish any task set in front of them without regard for self comfort or personal gain.

All of this comes at a price. See cons.","You will say goodbye to balance. In work (you will work harder than you ever have). In life (you will have little to none). In standards (you will hold yourself to the highest).

There will be times when you are physically and mentally exhausted when working something major, and you will want to throw in the towel - but you will look around and see that everyone else is feeling the same way - and you will either choose to press forward because you think what you're accomplishing is worth it, or you will reach for the white flag.

The work you do matters in a way that most tech work would not.
Palantir is a friendly, energetic, and collaborative environment where it's fun to be.
There's opportunity to work in places all around the world and travel basically as much as you want.
You'll be much more exposed to the business decisions and clients than you would in a typical software role. You'll learn a lot more than just software engineering.","It's really hard. You'll never be bored, but at times you'll be stressed, tired, and overwhelmed. You can't really be successful at Palantir with a 30-hour work week even if you could at a lot of other places. That's not for everyone, but for some it's not really a con.
There's a lot less structure/stability to the company than many people seek. It's constant chaos, which again for some people is fine, but definitely takes a certain kind of person.
You have to work on important things. At times that might be a technology you don't like, or it might not be coding at all. You can rest assured that there will be things to do, and they will matter, but it's harder to cherry-pick work based on tech. Even though there's plenty of mobility within the company, you might be most interested in something that doesn't exist at Palantir. Because the company is short on engineers and needs people focussed on the most important things, you can't hide in a corner on your own experimental research thing (unless you can show why it's valuable).",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2016-04-23, Software Engineer,"Palo Alto, CA",Current Employee ,A great place to grow,More than a year,0,"Very fast career growth. Since your lead probably has significantly more work they'd like to get done than they actually can, if you demonstrate that you be trusted to prioritize, plan, and deliver without their involvement you will be given more and more autonomy, very rapidly.

Related to the above: very fast personal growth. Since there is so much more work than can actually get done, you can basically choose any kind of project you wish to work on, and change regularly. You can try out roles you wouldn't normally, and tackle problems in various industries.","A lot of employees have only worked at Palantir, we are having to re-discover best practices which are known at more mature companies. Although things have markedly improved in the last 9 months, and I think this is now broadly acknowledged. It took us a long time to understand how bad some of our development practices, PQE org, etc. were.

Not a con for me, but if you don't thrive in autonomous environments where you have to seek out your own mentorship opportunities, then in I would not recommend working here.

Leadership really is very inexperienced. I haven't observed it being terrible, since people are generally compassionate and certainly not malicious.

- The best idea is the only one that wins and if you are smart, dedicated, and flexible that concept can lead to you actualizing your full potential.

You'll work harder than you've ever worked because you'll constantly have to defend your ideas - not against attack, but to make sure they're the best possible ideas. And I've never seen a company where failure goes unpunished, even celebrated - true to Palantir's ideals.","It's certainly not an easy place - the work is hard, the mission is hard, management pushes people to their limits. You'll need to be exceptionally self-reliant. And prepare to be surrounded by introverted engineers. And it's not a truly apolitical place (though nowhere ever really is, and overt politicking is deeply discouraged).",Keep pushing people to grow and take on more responsibility.
