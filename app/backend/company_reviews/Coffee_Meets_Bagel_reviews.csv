All employees are supportive and collegial. The work is interesting and it feels great to work on something meaningful.

The compensation seems to be market-rate for a start-up, and I think compares well even established small companies.","They have a single large loft office, which every study shows is the worst office space for employee productivity.

Each team member brings their own strengths to the table, and the collaborative culture has ensured that we're always learning from each other. The organization is currently pretty flat and pretty small... there's a lot of opportunity for people with enough initiative to make a big impact.

In my time with the company, I've learned a ton, and I really enjoy working on a consumer-facing problem. It's been great both for my personal and career growth.

I think the prospects of the company are very bright. Our focus on the customer (in part with our excellent CS team) and on women in particular, is paying a lot of dividends.
