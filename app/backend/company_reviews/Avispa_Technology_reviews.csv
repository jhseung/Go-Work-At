During the time that I've been working here I have had the opportunity to work with an amazing group of people and have enjoyed an outstanding work-life balance (rare to find in most companies these days). I've learned so much from everybody in the team and, thus, have continuously grown as an individual and as a professional. P.D.: There's just so much positivity: Restaurants visits/food ordering at least every month (if not every week), Music, Beer Fridays, Annual trips for employee recognition, a little more food ordering, task sharing and team bonding, food, etc.","I've gained too much weight; this needs to stop (just kidding, I love it).",Let's keep growing!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I started off as a recruiter, and that role was the perfect experience for me fresh out of University and settling into living in a new country. Since then, Avispa has provided countless opportunities for my career and skills growth, excellent training in HR processes, and a superior level of flexibility and comfort. Being in this role has not only been an asset for me, but additionally, this company is a proven excellent workplace for opportunity and growth in the English-speaking expatriate community in which I live.","This is not the sort of desk job where you will be rewarded for showing up and performing the bare minimum responsibilities. Avispa actively and continuously demands all of its employees and especially its internal team to grow, improve, learn, and deliver.

2017-04-07, Recruiter,Santiago (Chile),Current Employee ,Very Supportive Workplace,Very Supportive Workplace,0,"I am constantly amazed by the fact that I can consider all of my coworkers to be close friends. Internally, Avispa has created a fun and friendly atmosphere where recruiters work together and celebrate each other's hires. There are frequent gossip breaks in the snack room, employees take turns plotting birthday or anniversary surprises, and just generally support each other both professionally and personally.

Externally, the official approach is respectable - be direct and transparent. We can't know every detail about a role, but I think candidates appreciate that we're honest about what we do and don't know from the first interaction. The client experience is similar. We pride ourselves on our responsiveness (it's part of the company culture!) and the Avispa account managers are downright chummy with some of their client managers.","The company is growing quickly, but in an industry with a lot of seasonal ebbs and flows (tech staffing).

(I mean the coffee shop downstairs.),0,I am no longer there.,"The owner, Rothman Moncayo, forces his employees to write reviews of the company and is so short-sighted and small time, that they all cluelessly write basically the same review (editing reviews in ...3...2...1). The truth is he runs an illegal operation in a foreign country with employees on visas that do not allow them to legally be employed. They are payed under the table and have no benefits other than pizza and sushi in the office occasionally. Rothman even SUED ME to take down my Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to SUE HIM for fraud. Of course, since he is loaded and was able to pay a lawyer that has milked him for some nice cash, he stripped me of a huge amount of accumulated cash rewards my team and I earned and basically left my family on the street (he vowed to do that as well as letting me know I am a ""dead man"" when he sees me in the street. I know, it all sounds like prison jargon, but this is how he works. I can guarantee that his employees have been strong-armed into writing these reviews, but I also think it is pretty clear upon reading them.","The world is cyclical and I am sure that you do not wake up in the morning with a smile, especially not this morning and many more to come.
