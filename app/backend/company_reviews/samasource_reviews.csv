However, she's dismal at internal communication and management. Smart senior managers get hired, aren't enabled to take ownership of their roles and make decisions, become disheartened, and leave after 12-18 months. Then the cycle repeats itself.
- This unfortunate cycle means that the organization's growth is incredibly stunted: they effectively have to start over every year. This has led to cash constraints and an overall negative effect on morale and company culture.
- Classic ""Founder's Syndrome"" is at work here.

The company has tried to give employees more flexibility on their work environment, like working from home on various days. The office is in the heart of the Mission with lots of restaurants and unique shops. It is just unfortunate that it happens to be on the seediest intersection in the neighborhood. I made a lot of wonderful friends while work there who have a great understanding of the frustration that comes along with working at Sama.","The CEO's expectations are incredibly unreasonable, and she is extremely derogatory towards her employees. Her attitude is insincere and unfiltered. She may say this is because she is a new to management and has a lot of learning to do as a leader, but the way you treat people (especially when they aren't donating money or flying you somewhere) has a lot to do with your character. I have personally spoke with over 10 people that have worked there who have been verbally beaten down for something that could have been resolved with more effective communication skills. She is purely good as an outside motivation and networking piece to the company (she knows a lot of people), but she does not have enough emotional intelligence to head the company with real people, who work strenuously for the positive mission. The retention rate is crazy low.","Utilize your best resources - your employees. Ask them about their strengths. What they like about themselves. What they want to do next. What they don't think they're good at, and how they think that can be delivered by someone else in the company. Ask them if they feel like they have a sense of where the company is going, and be transparent about how you plan to get to the next steps. If they are afraid of failing, what drives that fear. How can you help them with overcoming those fears in a supportive role. Who do they enjoy spending time with, and what do they learn from those individuals. Do they like the work space. What is their preferred method of receiving feedback, and in what cadence. What are the top three things that are most important to them, both personally and professionally. Do they feel connected to the mission of the company. Ask, ask, ask. Take anonymous surveys all the time. Weekly if you have to. Even if it is something as simple as... provide examples of fun or exciting things the company could do to improve the culture. Each manager should build a structured roadmap for each of their reports, laying out specifically where they want to be, and when, then making a path of agreed upon steps to get there. Maybe it is taking on ""project x' two months from now, then checking in with that project, talking about what they are learning, then adding the next step on their roadmap. During this time, making sure this is truly adding to the expected obtained results. This will make them feel valued, and like they are making positive strides in their career during their time at Samasource. It keeps them motivated.

Turnover is extremely high-- 75% or more.

The business model itself is problematic. While Samasource's delivery team is in San Francisco-- the teams of workers completing the jobs are in Kenya and India. The Sama team has a weak presence in the field where the jobs are actually completed-- this creates a huge gap between the realities the actual ""disadvantaged"" workers face and what the folks at HQ perceive. Aside from a small outfit they run called the Samalab in Kenya, most of the work is completed by small business process outsourcing (BPO) partners that hire workers who are best fit for the job. Many of the workers are not ""disadvantaged""-- often they are middle class college grads who haven't found work elsewhere. The point is not that they should not get these jobs, but rather that the pitch Sama gives is highly misleading.

The model is also not as scaleable as they'd have you believe-- most businesses cannot afford triple or quadruple redundancy for their internet connection in Kenya and Uganda (where they have attempted to set up), given how often the internet goes down in the region. It is not possible to run a reliable BPO out of an IDP camp without the appropriate infrastructure. This company is a lot of hype and has been running on the fumes of good story telling.

For some from big corporate and traditional non-profit backgrounds, this can be a little shocking not having a lot of established processes or certainty in strategy. For others, it's a dream. You need to have a complete sense of accountability and transparency with your work to be able to fit in with the culture, and for some, that can be an adjustment. Because the organization is still firmly registered non-profit legally, salary packages are not reflective of the for-profit rates, although they're able to recruit some of the best talent from the for-profit world regardless.

- Low morale in an environment that should be the opposite; people don't seem to enjoy coming to work, and that starts at the top
- Talented employees are not incentivized to stay or to work on other things; without high pay or stock options, the company needs to give them other reasons to stick around

5. Culture is good: respectful, fun-loving people.","Turnover is above and beyond what is 'normal' for a start-up or for a nonprofit. These are what I believe are the biggest reasons why:

1. Constant irrational demands from the top with unprofessional and patronizing delivery.
2. Money, HR, processes, and high level decisions are not managed well.
3. No efforts have been made to retain high performers.

Chance to work in downtown SF in SOMA

Samasource is a high- profile and inspiring nonprofit

chance to work in a small, diverse, energetic team

Everyone at the company is very intelligent, talented, and hard- working

brilliant board of Directors

chance to wear many different hats

Chance to ""give work"" to people living in impoverished areas in the world. You go to work everyday, knowing that you're helping thousands of workers in other countries.","Disrespect for entry- level employees. examples: an intern was told by management that he was ""low on the pole"", the entry- level employees are typically given seats facing the wall and in the corners, interns shared desks

Management bandwidth is limited. This resulted in very little guidance and direction from your direct manager.

Tiny office space; people can easily disrupt others simply because of the crowded space

Extreme hours and demands for low- income salary (Most people do not leave the office before 7 pm)

High turn-over rate (about 50% turnoever every few months)

the CEO, while inspiring, brilliant, and driven, was extremely hard to work with. She barked out people's names and orders, criticized harshly to the point of making employees cry, and rarely praised anybody's hard work.

lack of communication between management and employees. In such a small team and space, employees are hesitant to voice concerns to superiors (ie, about their hours, treatment by the management, compensation). Management withholds important information from employees.

General feeling of unhappiness and tension within the office, coworkers are not friends outside the office. Office happy hours feel unnatural","Form and encourage a culture of respect and admiration.

Some of had to wait a whole year for a $5.00 salary increment. $5.00!! After a whole year!! What a big joke.
 Promotions are made, for lack of a better word, prematurely leading to frustrations instead of enjoying the perks that come with promotions. Vacancies are announced every other day but they are a very raw deal. We have people who have been in acting capacity for up to a year some of whom don’t even get paid incentives yet their KPIs are same as those who earn close to thrice their salary and are privileged with other resources which is VERY WRONG, not motivating at all and creates bitterness in a work environment.
Some of us have to work on weekends because of another project growing yet we don’t feel the impact of the growth.
