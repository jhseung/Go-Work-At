Being an engineer who works with infrastructure I'm supposed to be on-call. No on-call is good on-call IMO, but at Skillz the frequency is so low compared with other places I've worked at. They have dedicated on-call for every individual teams. They have meetings every week and you can discuss and adjust thresholds reasonably.
 2. Allowing teams to decide on their next quarter goals and ambitions. This doesn't mean that management is not involved at all, personally I think management has 15% power and the teams have 85% power. This is not the best part, they only expect you to finish 60% of your goals.
 3. They listen to the feedback, one of the primary complaints from many employees was that the pay was not on par with other standard tech companies, they took the feedback and updated the salary.
 4. I like the way they setup goals for promotions. Once you finish your goals you are ready for the promotion. I just hope they won't remove this in the future.
 5. Every one in the management works their a** off. I've seen the management team working late so many times.
 6. Excellent communication between multiple departments: I don't know how long this will last. Skillz is growing at a solid pace, and it is not easy to keep communication between multiple teams the same forever.
 7. They go out of their way to keep an employee at the company.","1. I personally don't eat lunch at the office (I'm an extremely picky eater, I make my own food), I see that a lot of people like to have lunch at the office so, it'd be nice if they provided lunch everyday instead of providing lunch a few days a week.
  2. It would be nice if they could increase the amount tax deductible for traveling and parking. Caltrain is getting very expensive.

This is not their first rodeo. The founders have been working together for 9 years and already have a very successful exit under their belts. They are very passionate about their business and believe in sustainable, measured growth, which is so refreshing. They are detail-oriented enough to be dangerous in any aspect of the company (incl. tech, business, ops, etc) while concurrently building and executing on a grand vision for the future of esports. They are truly remarkable founders.

Smart people:

There's analytics and then there's Skillz analytics. The emphasis on data at this company is astounding. Every decision made here is based on fact, after carefully examining relevant data and potential risks. I thought I was analytical before coming here, and have quickly learned that I have a lot to learn.

Incredible growth:

The growth of this place is amazing. Skillz was #1 on Inc's fastest growing private companies in 2017, and (remarkably) the hypergrowth has continued since! It has been a great learning experience to be a part of something that's growing so fast.

2: Mission
3: Balance
4: Care","1: Delegation
2: Communicating the hard things
3: Office space + perks","I think as an org. we will need to move to our ""teach a man to fish"" stage (rather than giving him a fish), in reference to this phrase:
""Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.""

Pros:
1: Transparency - Opinions are welcomed and communication avenues are open. We hold Town Hall meetings once per week where employees are free to ask questions to execs (either submitted ahead of time or live) about the business and our collective progress. The leadership team shows genuine care for its people by listening, improving and making changes where and when they can.

2: Mission - Daily work is exciting, challenging and keeps you motivated. We have many great problems to solve together and there's truly never a dull day in the office. I come into work inspired to come up with ideas to help solve them, despite not having a gaming background.

3: Balance - Many companies talk the talk, but this one walks the walk. I get to recharge my batteries when I need to, and come back to work refreshed, which makes me more effective at work. For me, this stands out a ton in comparison to prior jobs.

4: Care - I care about my coworkers, and I genuinely feel cared about. This shows in our approach to hiring (everyone who needs to be involved is always involved), and we take our time. It also shows in the time and effort that I see put into all things that impact culture.

Cons:
1: Delegation - We could do a better job empowering our leaders (not just leadership, but managers, team leads, etc.) to lead. Because of our size and executives' obvious care for everything we do, they are still very involved in daily decision-making. I think when we strike a better balance here we will see the company flourish even more as we grow.

2: Communicating the hard things: I think team members - from junior employees to execs - sometimes fear the ramifications of being honest when things aren't working well, so I think we could hold ourselves more accountable to have the tough conversations. Getting things out in the open will only help make an earlier resolution, which in turn makes us better.

3: Office space + perks - We're consistently making progress in this area, but I think a better office location will brighten all of our lives (which is coming!). On a similar note: I think more forward-thinking benefit and perk upgrades (that support health & wellness beyond basic medical needs) would be a great match for the company's general value for its people and work-life balance. I think we could also try to celebrate more of our company wins together.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

I believe in the team's mission to make gaming better. 2) The business/platform. Skillz is focusing right now on mobile and mobile is almost 50% of the global games market! Imagine if every game integrates with the platform? And maybe in the future expand to console, pc, etc? 3) The growth. It's incredible how much the team has accomplished in ~6 years. It is also in a very exciting stage of growth. Lots of opportunity to make an impact! 4) The people. During my interviews, I felt that the people I spoke with were very genuine, passionate about Skillz, and I could see myself working with them.

Now that I'm part of the team, all 4 above still hold true -- #4 most especially. Everyone has been very supportive and I genuinely feel that they are setting me up for success. It's a friendly, vibrant, collaborative environment. Everyone I met so far seem smart, yet they understand and respect that people here came from different backgrounds and wouldn't just expect you to know their stuff. They provide you with the support and guidance that you need. In addition, I like that the company values work-life balance and they actually put that into practice (unlike other companies that say they value work-life balance but shows otherwise)! My observation: people work hard during work hours and generally goes offline after work hours.

Additional perks: You get to play games at work (Skillz games of course :D ). There's basketball, foosball, pingpong, board games, consoles, arcade games, etc in the office. Mon-Thu dinners. Fri lunches. Thursday game night. Great health benefits. Equity!","I guess similar to other reviews here, the office location is quite the down side. However, we're moving to a new location soon! Very exciting!",,5.0,,,,,
2019-02-22,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,An Exciting Place to Work,An Exciting Place to Work,0,"It's your quintessential fast growing SF tech startup, so it's an exciting environment to work. Company is frequently setting new milestones and growing super rapidly in headcount and revenue, which leads to opportunities to take on more and more for those willing to step up. It's also a pretty fun, collaborative environment -- lots of people play games of all sorts together in the evenings, have beers together on Friday, or do other activities together. You also get to play games during the day.

Work life balance is honestly way better than other places I've seen, most people arrive between 8:45-9am, and leave between 5-6pm, which is a pretty reasonable timeframe. Certainly there are exceptions and ebbs and flows, but those are not the norm.

The CEO Andrew can rub people the wrong way, but he's been very successful leading the company thus far and has a strong vision for where we're going, and he's certainly a pretty smart guy in general, so overall I think he's a good leader at this time, even though I would do some things differently.","There's definitely some growing pains. I think senior leadership is essentially just as involved in every minor day-to-day decision now as there were when I started, which was some time ago. I think they need to step out of the day-to-day and trust their teams more, even if that means they don't agree with every decision being made.

Despite the startup size, there's many layers, and more bureaucracy than I've seen at a 3000 person plus organization. I've heard stories of people spending hours writing cost-benefit analyses for very minor expenses, which is ludicrous. (Frugality is a value which is taken a bit too far in my opinion.)

Accept it, deal with it, and you'll be fine.","Step out of more day-to-day decisions. Accept that the ""boots on the ground"" know more about what's happening and where the opportunities are than you do at this point, and trust them, even if it means you'll disagree with some decisions.

I wanted to write this review because I don't believe the one star reviews are an accurate depiction of what working at Skillz is like. Culturally Skillz is a work hard / play hard environment epitomizing what is the best of startups while also showing how different a startup environment is from a Google or Facebook size company. In the past 5 years if there is one thing I can say it's that Skillz has only gotten better. In fact, we are hoping to be ready to IPO by the end of this year. I think that any company that has made this much progress from the early days of a cocktail napkin to approaching IPO has to go through a pretty epic journey of change... and frankly some people don't like change. I'd also add that in that voyage, there are ups and downs... there are so many reasons to be happy and also those that make us sad but it would be a farce to call this a one star. In that vein, some of the long standing as well as some of the more recent pros are:

* free lunch every friday

* free dinner monday through thursday

* true digital black out where no non-mission critical emails/slacks are sent friday eve until sunday eve.

* work life balance is real

* ever increasing valuable stock options as well as benefits. More recently teams started getting leadership development budgets to pay for us to go to conferences in industry.

* day of service - we all are volunteering as a company upcoming in May

* half day fridays in August - we close the office at noon every friday in August. It's amazing.

* Killer summer offsite and epic holiday party - this past year we rented out an enormous ship in the harbor - it was literally a battleship

* Playing games for a job? It might sound like torture but it's way better than Salesforce!

* Amazing people who are truly motivated to achieve, build and win. We're building a long term independent company and it shows in everything we do.

* Open door policy with our executives - we have a town hall with our c-suite weekly. We have office hours where we can talk to our executives each week 1:1

* We believe in a brighter, better future. We are truly mission oriented.","* office location - we're right on the edge of the TL but we are moving to the heart of SOMA so this really isn't that big of a deal although the past couple of years here has been rough

* This isn't grade-school, it's college. Things are hard in the real world. Growing 3 to 4x every year is amazing on the one hand but tiring on the other.

The people at Skillz are amazing. They are some of the smartest and most talented people I have had the pleasure of working with. I have worked in start-up, mid-size and Fortune 500 companies and this by far is one of the best experiences for my career. Every single person's contribution matters. You will see the effects of your work make a difference to the business daily.
Skillz is a start-up and that means you have to thrive in an environment where you have to fasten your seatbelt. It is not for the feint of heart or anyone who wants to do the same thing day after day.
This is a once in a lifetime company. The possibilities for where the company can go are endless. It may not be for everyone but if you are looking for a company that is a rocket ship this is as close as you will come.","As with any start-up, there will be growing pains. If you don't have a lot of experience with other companies or start-ups, you may think of it as a sharp environment. But it is a company that is on a path to IPO and in order to make that happen everyone needs to work hard and fast.","Delegation - empower management team and managers to make decisions to run their businesses, it will enable the growth of the company to be optimized.

I report to the COO and find him accessible and whipsmart. I have hilarious conversations over meals with just about anyone in the company--it's that friendly, and everyone is that interesting. Truly.
-- The caliber of the work we are asked to do is high. I am fully-engaged--in a good way. I've had a few previous jobs where I was bored, or I was working harder than my co-workers (by a mile). Not the case here--everyone rolls up their sleeves and we get down to business. This isn't a place for people who are shy, or are looking to coast--you are expected to produce results, regardless of your department.
-- I love all of the little Skillz traditions, from kickoff on Monday, to wrap on Friday, Friday group lunches, bug bounties, team chants, daily scrum Skillz t-shirt Fridays, Finance Fun Shirt Friday, WEEKENDS OFF(!), to having a local watering hole right next door. I came not from the startup world, and while we occasionally (unintentionally) veer into HBO ""Silicon Valley"" hilarity territory, most of it Skillz's traditions are charming and energizing.
-- The benefits are good - I like everything from the high-quality healthcare (which is way cheaper than my previous employer) to the free lunches on Friday.
-- The company is doing really well. Some of my (younger) colleagues don't understand how phenomenal the company's results are...but they are crazy impressive. It's exciting to feel like your tiny role, combined with your colleagues' efforts, resulted in some stunning metrics.

2019-02-22, Chief Revenue Officer,"Lafayette, CA",Current Employee ,Bullish on Skillz,Bullish on Skillz,0,"I joined Skillz for 3 fundamental reasons:

1. First and foremost I joined for the people -- their potential, their smarts and the opportunity to help them grow.

2. Secondly, it's rare in your career you get a wide open field to run through flexing your 'career experience' muscles. Career stagnation is rife in the corporate world and too many people never get the chance to tap into their true potential. Skillz really offers employees the potential to break through their glass ceilings of potential and pioneer new ground.

3. Finally, I fundamentally believe that this is a once in a 15 year company. It's a rocket ship and I haven't been disappointed. We break new growth records every week and I have to pinch myself sometimes to remember how rare that is.","Skillz is growing fast and that comes with growing pains associated with new learnings and pioneering new territory. Every department and every level of the team here goes through this every week and sometimes we just have to pause, look back and see how far we've come. I haven't worked for a single company in my career which is perfect and i'm pretty sure I never will. I've have also never worked for anyone who is perfect and i'm pretty sure I never will.

My experiences run the gamut from the wildly difficult start-up days of sprinting constantly just to release a working product, to the marathon we are in now of striving to become a long-term sustainable, scalable, profitable company.

• The pain points of Skillz are always changing because the people at Skillz are always working to improve themselves, and the company.
• Incredibly opportunity for growth, both personal skills and career growth. Skillz has been growing like wildfire since I've joined, and the speed of growth is only increasing.
• Half-day Fridays are amazing, ~5 weeks around August ever year, we close the office at 1pm.
• For younger engineers, when you join the company, the focus on mentorship during onboarding is very high.
• Transparency, we talk openly about problems, successes, challenges, and wins.
• The salaries, benefits, and perks continue to improve, year over year.
• It takes some time to understand the full platform, but once you do, it's absolutely fascinating.
• You really do need to care about the product, care about improving it, and care about improving yourself, to work here. It's not expected that you'll take a job here, and just collect a paycheck. For some people, this doesn't really fit with what they're looking for.
• The company is lead by seasoned individuals, who have had significant success elsewhere, and it's obvious that they care deeply about building a long term, sustainable company.
• Town halls are held every couple of weeks by the Exec team for anyone and everyone to ask questions, hard/difficult/awkward questions are encouraged, not swept under the rug.
• Failure and disagreement, within reason, are well accepted and in some cases extremely encouraged. Both ""Strong opinions held loosely"", and ""radical candor"" are in full effect here.
• Skillz has a huge focus on inclusivity in hiring, and in our culture.

Bottom line, Skillz is imperfect, but always striving to improve, and is on a path to become a multi-media giant, while reshaping the face of the mobile gaming industry.

I love working here, love what we've built, and even though I may move on some day down the road, I will always look back fondly on my time here.","• It's a hard job. It is a HARD job. The expectations are high, and you will be given responsibility for things that really matter. It will be expected that you care about delivering high-quality work. Sometimes it's quite a lot of pressure, but I personally prefer having the power to affect real change, over no pressure and no responsibility.
• Organization of any company changes when it goes through massive growth, Skillz is no different. This can be frustrating, but it's something everyone is trying to improve.
• Feedback is direct and can be brutal, but I've learned this comes from deep care for the organization and the people within it.
• The current office neighborhood is not great, but the company is working very hard on fixing that.
• Skillz doesn't always move as fast as you'd hope, but when it does, it delivers.",,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

2019-02-22,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,A Place for Passion and Growth,A Place for Passion and Growth,0,"-Team dynamics and culture: Skillz does have differences in daily workflow and culture team-by-team. Don't forget to ask during the interview what the team culture is like and seek opportunities to spend time with various members and ask into the daily and quarterly culture and goals. For me, I have a team that I love to work with containing individuals that are competitive with themselves but not with each other and make coming to work each day a chapter of the mission to look forward to.
-Ownership opportunities: There are 'green field' areas in the business and team you join where you can make an impact as an individual contributor. This is not only empowering but presents rare opportunity to take control of your own growth and expansion of both soft and hard skills.
-Career trajectory and mentorship: If you work with gusto and with collaboration from the many talented and intelligent team members and teams to drive results, there will be ample opportunities to move ""up"" in your team or department's career ladder or try new projects or roles on other teams if you take the time to go above and beyond your hired role.","-Continuing work on diversity and inclusion training: Skillz has been making strides towards establishing systems to protect our diverse culture and ensure inclusivity for a friendly and honorable workplace. The current state is still WIP, but with sustained focus I believe the improvements that are currently underway and seen will compound into the desired end result.
-Training and documentation: It is understandably one of the lower priority tasks to document and archive rather than focus on building and growing, but it can make training challenging. Skillz will need to address this debt as it works on scaling.","-Invest in training management and leadership: The above career growth opportunities within the company does mean a lot of internal promotions based on achievement. However, high achievers do not automatically become good or great managers. Investing into programs and classes for aspiring leaders within the organization would go a long way towards employee retention.
-Keep the communication lines transparent and honest and listen to the silent majority: Employees appreciate the dedication leadership has towards communicating significant events and details about the company's trajectory. Keeping these lines open and disseminating information honestly while working to listen to the quieter, less aggressively outspoken employees to cultivate a more inclusive workplace will raise the satisfaction of employees overall and allow them to focus on their work and team.",4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

- Career growth opportunities are immense. I started here a few years out of school and have changed titles about every 9 months. If you believe in the mission and do love the work you are creating, you can go far. The more we hire and grow, the more your duties change and adapt to the needs that surround you.

This caused extreme anxiety pretty much all of the time.
- A lot of opportunities to learn can be a double-edged sword. You may find yourself in the situation where you're working on new things and start to feel overwhelmed about not getting enough done, due to the point system.

Perhaps even more importantly, the caliber of people at Skillz is unmatched by any company where I’ve ever worked. Everyone I work with here is smart, passionate, and fundamentally good. We motivate each other to do well but also care about helping each other out and discuss the importance of balance and taking time to recharge – this is one of the reasons I came to Skillz and consistently decide to stay here.

Our leaders are truly invested in the success of both the company and every individual here. They show this through establishing recurring 1:1 meetings to discuss both day-to-day projects and overall career trajectory, by holding bi-weekly ""town hall"" meetings open to the entire staff (during which the executive team answers both anonymous and un-anonymous questions candidly), and empowering employees to have ownership over their focus area and make a tangible impact.

Being a hiring manager and helping to onboard/train new employees has been incredibly rewarding, and has deepened my belief in our mission even more. Even at the incredibly fast rate we're growing and hiring, to know that every new Skillzian who joins the team will get to learn and grow from being here is so exciting. It's one thing to do your job (and do it well) but being able to amplify our impact by imparting knowledge to others has given me an even deeper understanding and mastery of my role here.

We have high hiring standards, but anyone who joins the Skillz team is receiving a massive opportunity. I actively mention Skillz to my friends and promote the company/job opportunities to my network, but I more often find myself wondering if a connection is high caliber enough as a colleague to join us than I wonder about whether to recommend the company to friends. Everyone knows what an amazing experience I've had working here, and that they'd be lucky to become a Skillzian!","I don't think anyone would call Skillz a workplace where you can mail it in – everyone here works very hard. In a company that’s growing as quickly as we are, it’s inevitable that you’ll encounter challenges along the way and have to work through them to succeed.

This company tends to attract ambitious, high-achieving individuals, and it’s not for everyone. However, I think our selective hiring process helps find people who will both enjoy being here and thrive in our fast-paced, boundary-challenging environment. There are always bumps in the road, but I genuinely believe we always do our best to weather any storms together and take care of our most important resource – our people.","We’re creating the future of an industry, and everyone knows some weeks can be more stressful than others.

Working on a product you can be proud of. Skillz is doing really innovative work, and is a lot less shifty than many companies out there. And there are definitely times where you can point to success in the company and say “Hey, that was me. I helped make that happen!”

Culture. A lot of work goes into making people feel welcome at Skillz, both as an employee and as a person. Some teams are better at it than others, but if you genuinely want to feel like part of the team, people will go out of their way to make that happen.

Transparency. There are regular meetings to discuss company and department goals. If you want to know what is going on, all you have to do is ask.

Here, you'll celebrate because it's likely that it took a ton of sweat from you individually to make it happen, and the company will acknowledge it.
-Skillz takes itself and the way it runs it's business very seriously. I've worked for other companies, startups included, that are very concerned with flash, and not with making sure that the business is stable and sustainable. That has never been a worry of mine here at Skillz.

-We are a company that hires some of the best IC's that I've seen. I mean incredible, passionate people, but as those employees move up to leadership roles, it takes a while to make that transition. Because we're growing as fast as we are, we have a lot of people transitioning to leadership roles, I think this is a temporary issue, but this isn't a huge established tech giant, and I think if you're looking for that level of structure, and for a situation where maybe you and your boss aren't both trying real hard to hit all the things you need to do in a day, this may not be the spot for you.
-I think Skillz does what it can to make employees comfortable, and to make the workplace a place that people want to be, but currently we're not a nap pod, everyone has treadmill desks, with an onsite chef and a sauna company.

Working at Skillz does come with some of the perks of working at a Bay Area start up such as free dinner (served outside of core hours, to incentivize employees to stay late), a yearly off-site event, beer on tap and generally casual work environment.","This company has the potential to be great but is held back by two co-founders that do not know how to treat people with respect or run a business at this scale. While the CEO is the driver of many of the issues and ultimate decision maker, the COO lacks empathy and regard for employees and it is glaringly apparent.

The amount of things horribly wrong (micromanagement, completely inappropriate CEO, pay under market, no room for career growth, goals that are crafted to be unattainable) can not outweigh the camaraderie and opportunity to work in an exciting industry.

It is mentally taxing for employees (from management to entry level) to tip toe around the CEO and it has created a working environment dominated by politics and a sense of job instability. The relationship that the CEO has with the management team is dominated by fear and lack of trust, and it is replicated in many relationships between management and their employees. While this does not apply to all managers, this emulation of C-suite behavior at the managerial level is at the root of many of the systemic issues with the company dynamic.

Do not expect to receive positive reinforcement (or monetary, for that matter) for a job well done. Do expect to see great employee after great employee leave after they can no longer bear the experience of working at Skillz. It becomes disparaging to witness the overwhelming amount of turn over. Furthermore, it is telling that every former employee I have spoken with expresses relief to be gone, along with sadness and concern for the colleagues that continue to work at Skillz.","You hire intelligent and thoughtful employees. Smart people can tell when you are taking short cuts and undercutting their value. Don't be surprised when they react negatively to the toxic culture that perpetuates this workplace and refuse to accept the lukewarm initiatives taken to rectify the issues. Just because they are posting online instead of coming to your office hours, doesn't mean that the problem doesn't exist. Stop invalidating the concerns regarding their experiences.

TO C-SUITE LEADERSHIP: Try genuinely taking an interest in treating your employees with basic decency and you will be pleasantly surprised with the response. At the end of the day, it is in your favor to treat people better. The longer things stay the same, the more dire the consequences will be for you when all is said and done.

TO NON C- SUITE LEADERSHIP: Think about the way that the C-suite managerial style makes you feel and consider whether you replicate these tactics with your team. Reconsider the way you do things if the answer to these questions reflect an unpleasant or uncomfortable reality.

This is all completely within your control. It is not that difficult to treat your employees and coworkers with respect. Decide to be better and do better by your employees and you will see a change in the discourse surrounding your company.",2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

They do not want you to work on the weekend and most people generally work 9-5 give or take an hour. I would say I have a good work-life balance, in spite of commuting from outside SF.

While it does move fast, and lofty goals are set, it's never boring, and it's even expected that not all goals will be fulfilled by their given timeline. Progress is closely tracked (in a non-micromanagement way) and audibles are often called, but if you're putting in that work you've got nothing to hide.

I appreciate the transparency as well. The executives host town hall meetings where questions/concerns can be submitted anonymously and answered to all those in attendance. Unless you are on the executive team, you otherwise won't have daily interactions with the CEO/COO, so I'm not sure where all the negative reviews about them are coming from either.

I truly believe the co-founders would leave the business before resorting to unethical business practices and that holds true in the company they've built. Employees are honest, transparent, will respectfully listen to you and expect you to listen in return. Perhaps a low bar, but I have not found this to be a common practice in my ten years in tech.

- The most diverse company I've ever been a part of, smashing any publicized diversity stats that I've seen for tech/gaming at this size. We can certainly do better, but I'm very proud that this continues to be a company priority with visible results.

- Extremely high hiring standards. I have never worked with a group of more intelligent and passionate individuals who are constantly pushing me to be better. There are definitely individuals learning to do their specific job for the first time, which seems fairly common when building out a new industry, but very few that seem to be under-qualified or just along for the ride.

- Up and to the right, week over week! There's a running joke about how we are breaking our own growth records so frequently that it's become anticlimactic, but I've had to watch multiple companies struggle to adapt after finding initial success and will always appreciate a healthy growth curve. It's more interesting, more challenging, allows for more growth, and it's important for me to know my work is actually driving tangible business results. Growth at this scale is also a tad terrifying, which keeps me on my toes.","- Some key roles throughout the company continue to remain unfilled. This isn't terribly surprising in a high growth start-up and I'd prefer it over lowering our hiring standards just to get people through the door, but it would be great to have a qualified employee handling every major function.

- We have the usual successful start-up issues... the building could be nicer, policies could be clearer, things could break less, we need to build out robust management training, A/V could be better for remote employees, etc. If you're expecting a multi-week onboarding experience punctuated by trips to a nap pod, you're probably going to have a rough first few weeks. On the flip side, it's very satisfying to help us avoid mistakes that I've seen (or made) at past companies that were rapidly scaling. I can also say that while there are large chunks of missing HR documentation, I've never had an issue getting an answer for me or my team when I needed clarification on time off, travel policies, healthcare, 401k, etc. It would be great if I had a resource I could just refer to myself, but it's never caused me anything more than the inconvenience of reaching out.

- Cash compensation and benefits are certainly below what I could get working in established tech/gaming (Google, Facebook, Riot, etc.) That said, I appreciate that the company has never tried to pretend that's not the case and has always been transparent that I'm trading some short term comfort for ownership and agency. Benefits have improved year over year, as I was originally promised.","- Stick to your values and stay the course.

- I did not feel comfortable giving feedback during meetings in the same room as the founders after observing the repercussions I saw others face when they didn’t agree with them.

Why? Well… Another week, another HR Team member leaves. I have been a manager here for about a year and we have had 3 HR Team members start and leave Skillz in that time. This summer, I heavily relied on our new HR person due to a lot of team HR issues these past few months, but sadly he quit last week after just starting in early June, and he was the best and most senior one Skillz has had so far. It’s time for me to start searching elsewhere because Skillz can’t seem to hold on to their HR people. Once they get here, they realize there is no Top-Down support for them. And I don’t blame them.

I have asked my manager for training the entire time I’ve been here, and the executives seem to think management training is not important. So I am denied each time I try to ask to go to a conference or seminar for my job. There are so many bad managers here who are immature and don’t deserve their titles, and the People-side of things at Skillz has been severely deficient and detrimental to the overall employee base. If this year has taught me anything, it is that if the executive team doesn't like you, you better watch your back. I thought I was going to get fired so many times these past few months because of how many times execs would exclude me from meetings or go around me to talk to my direct reports. My team was also reorganized with no notice and I didn’t have any HR support because HR never knew that this change was happening. Not surprised.

Additionally, our Skillz benefits pale in comparison to other companies I’ve been to. Our HR Team still has no dedicated HR person with experience, and the C-Level suite seem to care more about a campy and superfluous summer off-site this month than they do about actually investing in their people. Nobody cares about a boarding a bus ride together, when a more pressing issue is fixing how our benefits questions take over 48 hours to get a response.

My spouse and I have also put off getting pregnant because it’s 2018 and Skillz has no maternity leave policy! I know! And each of the past 3 HR people told me a policy was going into effect “soon”, but still there is not one. We don’t have time to wait for the inexperienced and recalcitrant co-founders to actually care about formalizing a maternity policy because I can’t keep telling my spouse “Now is not the time for a kid because my job has no policy for us.”

It’s beyond sad now. It’s laughable actually that our website has ALL LEVELS of HR openings open because Skillz can’t retain a single one of them. Not to mention, Skillz has been unable to hire an HR VP because all of the candidates probably can sense the dysfunction of the top level execs, and how the HR function is not respected at Skillz, nor is it seen as a priority.

Securing funding always takes a priority apparently. (cue eye roll)

How many more HR people have to quit for Skillz to finally take notice of how severely lacking their leadership team is?

When your reputation is that bad among recruiters, you know you've got to be doing a lot of things wrong.

The biggest con-- and I've noticed other people remarking on this too-- is the culture of micromanagement and blame. They have no clue how to use scrum, except that they then yell at you for not finishing enough stories (which were written pretty arbitrarily to begin with). Whenever anything appears to go wrong, rather than trying to figure out if something is actually wrong or what the cause is, management's first response is to look for someone to blame. Several times I got publicly chewed out for something that hadn't happened. When I proved it hadn't happened, there was no sort of apology, just a quiet ""oh"".

Notice how all these things are superficial?","It would take hours to delineate every con with this place, so I'll just stick to a few salient ones:

Culture of extreme micromanagement, gaslighting, and blame-casting. Someone is always looking over your shoulder, not trusting you to get your work done. You're often blamed for things that don't adhere to a process you were never informed of, or that directly contradict things written down in the employee handbook.

Don't ever expect to WFH, take time off, or even visit the doctor. The employee handbook clearly claims that employees have unlimited vacation and can WFH 2x/week, but in practice this involves tracking your days in the system AND emailing the C-suite executive in charge of your department. I was too nervous to even schedule a much-needed dental appointment.

You'll spend most of your time adhering to protocol and procedure instead of simply accomplishing the work that you've been hired for. Expect to record meaningless notes about your work in several different places in lieu of doing said work. If you run out of work early or have too much on your plate that week, oops means you didn't point out your work correctly, so that's on you, enjoy sitting at your desk doing nothing for days.

Turnover is EXTREMELY high. My department lost someone at least every two weeks and I was only there a few months. This does nothing for morale. This is likely a contributing factor to Skillz's inability to hire and retain engineers, even in a city like this.

This is not just another job with other employees: everyone is on a mission and that's what makes every day exciting.

I'm not a big gamer, so I was a little nervous taking the job, but it really doesn't matter. Gamer or not, the work is fun, the product is interesting, and the tech is amazing!

2018-01-21, Talent Acquisition Specialist,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Best Job I've Ever Had,Best Job I've Ever Had,0,"I learned so much during my time at Skillz and I definitely miss working there, specially now that I've moved on to a corporate job and can compare the two experiences. One of the best parts about working at Skillz was the people. They are SMART. I felt challenged every day because I was surrounded with people who were smarter than me, and that pushed me to work my hardest so that I could be on their level. They're also really fun, good people, with great values. Skillz took a lot of care into hiring top notch people, a few of my closest friends are people who I met at Skillz.

The product? So cool! Seriously, such a brilliant idea and concept. And clearly the rest of the gaming and tech world is picking up on this, given how much attention esports and Skillz has been getting in the media. It was awesome being at a company with such an innovative product that was doing better than other companies trying to copy it.

Another thing I loved at Skillz was how much responsibility I had and how they trusted me to hit my goals, essentially however I needed to. I wasn't micromanaged or told how to do my job, and as I showed that I could deliver, I was given even more trust and freedom to do things the way that I wanted to. Now being at a corporate job where I'm just a number and told exactly how I'm supposed to do every little thing, I really appreciate how Skillz gave me that flexibility and freedom.

I also never felt like the unlimited PTO benefit was a bad thing that made me feel like I couldn't ever request time off, I took as much vacation as I wanted. Just make sure you're getting your job done. Why shouldn't you be able to take time off? It makes sense.

Skillz now does way more stuff for culture (off sites, in office gaming events) than they did when I was there (but Culture Club did start during my time there, and the games at work/picnic were so fun!), so I think that's really great that they've realized the importance of organizing these kinds of things to help foster the culture and values.

Overall, great company for my career growth. They'll push you just the right amount to make you better and better at what you're trying to do and I'm grateful that they did that for me, because it helped me recognize my strengths and where I want to take my career in the future.

Final Pro: Andrew & Casey - super smart, kind, awesome people. I loved working with these two and learned so much from the both of them. Great people & co-founders.","Yes, it's a startup. It's not a huge corporate company with billions of perks like free this and that, and structures and processes that are written down about everything. People should join startups who WANT to build these processes out. And if you're looking to join a startup company just for free meals/lots of drinking/office pets, then you should re-evaluate what motivates you, because in order to be successful at a startup, you really have to believe in what the company is doing. Some days, being at Skillz was definitely really hard. It was exhausting and it was a grind, but I believed in what I was doing and knew that what I did contributed to the overall success of the company, so it was worth it. Take a look at how Skillz did in 2017 - they did so well. It felt good to know that I helped contribute to that success. I did, and still do, believe in what Skillz is doing, and that's a huge reason that I was happy and successful there, and I would advise anybody against joining a startup that they do not believe in. I would 100% still be at Skillz today if I didn't move away from California for personal reasons.","Personally, I did think the interview process was a bit longer than necessary, but I know why Andrew & Casey wanted it that way. Skillz wants to make sure they're hiring the best of the best and sometimes you have to have a few conversations with somebody to know it's a good fit on both ends.

Anytime I was upset about anything or didn't agree with a process/goal/etc, and had justified reason for it, I would tell my manager and we would always come to a solution. Always. If people are unhappy at Skillz, they should address the issue with their direct manager. I did, and my manager would work with the executives to find a solution. My advice to upper management would be to be as receptive to this kind of feedback from everyone, as I'm sure some people are scared to speak up if they are upset about something.

Final piece of advice is to just keep doing what you're doing. Skillz didn't just get to where it is today by sheer luck - you guys are obviously doing something right! And don't listen to the trolls on Glassdoor. They're wrong. It must be beyond incredibly difficult to run a company scaling at the speed that Skillz is, so keep up the good work!",5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Not sure what to think of all that, as all the people I've talked to here seem happy, but I guess all I can do is talk about my experience which has been great. To start with, the people here are amazing. They're all really smart and truly seem to care about the product they're building. Next the product. It's a really cool idea with a bright future. It's fun to work on games, especially when theres thousands of them. Finally, the pay: the cash is maybe a bit above average, but the stock is where its at! The company is generous with this and transparent about you'e got and what its worth, which is nice since my last startup wasn't like.

All in, I'm proud to be here!","Things may not be perfect but they are good. Really good. Do I wish the office was in nicer neighborhood? Sure. Does it matter? Not really.

* The company is doing quite well and is rapidly increasing pay and benefits.

* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority are).

* Skillz is amazingly open: every week our CEO wraps up the week with discussing our progress and beer/wine is served. This meeting includes an open forum to ask the executives anything you want.

* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams work more crazy hours often - but very few of them). Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are highly-motivated and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.

* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. A big complaint from some is about not being able to advance by just doing the minimum. Sure, if you're a genius, you're going to advance super fast without having to do anything but if you're like most of us -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Skillzians -- you're just good not revolutionary.",It is becoming larger and with that comes growing pains as mentioned in some of the other reviews.,Don’t get discouraged by the few trolls.

coworkers are generally cool","- huge lack of knowledge in the company. Most of the teams consist of college grads and most of the managers have been promoted internally. As a result you'll have opportunities to do what seniors would do at other companies, but it'll be way over your pay rate and at times miserable.
- projects are way overscoped. Managers reconcile this by saying that not all of the features are required. This creates a gray area though where people pick and choose what features they want, creating a mess of a project. This also creates a rush to add as much of the spec as possible, resulting in a buggy codebase which doesn't scale well.
 - huge turnover. Teams hire like crazy but headcount stays the same. Most senior people leave after a year creating huge gaps in knowledge. Little to no documentation on processes until someone leaves.","I don't know why a company is having trouble hiring engineers in the middle of sf, but you guys desperately need them",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0
