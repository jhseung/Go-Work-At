The culture and accessibility to executives is unthinkable. The ability for individual contributors to drive the company roadmap and the easily approachable and talented individuals in every division is incredible. If I wouldn't have been afforded the opportunity to experience it myself I doubt I would have believed it. It simply is the best company to work for. It's a wonderful feeling not being the smartest person in the room while the smartest people in the room are humble enough to share their knowledge openly regardless of the company division you work for. Throw in the consistently amazing talent the Synack community brings to each engagement and it's obvious that Synack will continue being the place to work in 2018.,There aren't any as of 2018.,Leadership is everything.

2017-05-16,,,Former Employee ,Mirror Mirror on the wall...,,0,"A great company with tons of potential to become a leader within the security infosec space. You have your common SV perks: Organic snacks, LaCroix sparkling water, Hint water, Kombucha, daily lunches and weekly in-office Happy Hours. Nothing too special but a way to keep you longer in the office.","40 hour work weeks are easily 50 - 60 hour work weeks. It's an environment where you can easily burn out. ""Unlimited PTO"" aren't really unlimited but frowned upon because there's always work that ""needs"" to get done. The extra hours and time you dedicate is not appreciated but ""part of the job"". An ""excellent"" end-of-the year review will earn you a disrespectful raise, don't dare to ask for more because false promises will be made. Promotions are only given to those who are favorited. Majority of the time, it's not even clear what people do to get promoted all the time. Most importantly, Synack is the definition of ""office politics"". The young executive team tends to isolate themselves from the rest of the company, point fingers at others instead of being accountable, make excuses for goals not being met, pick and choose favorites within the company, and hold many hallways and conference room gossip sessions. This might as well be the next reality TV show. Suggestion/questionnaires during All-Hands is only a gimmick to show that the management team is open to listen but it gets overlooked and brushed under the rug left to be forgotten. A work/life balance is non-existence so if you're looking for a fun cultured environment to work in, this is not the place.","Running and managing a business is more than just having a client sign a check. There are people who cares about the mission of the company and wants to make a change within the industry. Apparently, that passion and drive is not important to the management team. As leaders within the company, respect is earned and not given. If you want to be respected or even care about being respected, work on your leadership skills, set your egos aside, and focus on the steps that needs to be taken to be called a great company.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

The workplace and notion of HR are vastly superior to what I have experienced elsewhere - they enable the business. Open doors? No need, it's an open floor plan where everyone is accessible. We fight the bad guys and we do it well, our solution is simple and effective and leveraged by the US department of defense and world's largest, most prestigious financial service companies, retail, healthcare and tech companies.

I will keep this very short and to the point, POOR MANAGEMENT. Especially in the e-team, there is no sense of expectation but they will be first to point fingers and find a scapegoat. Management was leading with their egos and political agendas instead of being effective managers providing training and support.

2016-08-08, Program Manager,"Redwood City, CA",Current Employee ,"Great Company, Great Mission",,0,"I have been with Synack for a little over a month now and have truly enjoyed coming into work everyday. The people I work with are the best at what they do, are extremely motivated, and insanely intelligent. At the same time, though, they all know how to let loose and have a good time (especially during our weekly happy hours over some ping pong, foosball, and board games).

We also have a very open working space which helps foster collaboration between various teams and everyone is extremely approachable and willing to lend a helping hand or explain a complex concept until you fully understand what's going on, including management and leadership.

Some of the extra perks like catered meals, a stocked snack bar, and an onsite gym with basketball court and swimming pool are just the cherries on top of it all.","Thus far, the only downside of working at Synack for me has been the commute, but with the flexibility and understanding nature of our leadership, and my manager in particular, it hasn't even been an issue.","Continue to listen to the suggestions of Synack's employees, researchers, and customers and incorporate them into the future direction of the company and its solution.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,

The culture is fun, and very laid back, yet everyone is motivated to work hard and learn from each other. I'd say it's the epitome of the true small company environment!

Some of the people are really nice.","Coming from a startup with a great culture this was a shock to my system. Synack offers no leadership, transparency or support to its employees. This is one of those places where there's constantly whispers in hallways and you'll never know whose head is going to roll next. I found this to be a very unsettling and anxiety inducing environment. If you have offers from Facebook/Google/Twitter or any other legit tech company and you think this startup might be more fun, think again. Synack likes to pretend they're a startup but they really act like a big company with many restrictions, lack of transparency and a leadership structure that is far from flat.

We've doubled in size since I've been here and I still feel like I know everyone pretty well due to our weekly happy hours and fun company outings.

2016-05-18,,,Former Employee ,Smoke and mirrors,,0,"Cool office, mostly nice people, free lunch, happy hours, decent work-life balance.","If you expect this to be a typical startup with a flat organizational structure and inspiring leadership where transparency is the norm and honest feedback is encouraged, prepare to be disappointed. At Synack the management ranges from mediocre to awful, there's no unity between or within teams and zero support for employees. Feedback only flows from the top down and leadership by example doesn't exist here. Management doesn't set clear expectations and takes no interest in developing people. Trust, transparency and culture are all empty words at Synack, they are thrown around a lot but they don't mean anything. Founders don't have a startup background and don't seem to realize that culture isn't about foosball or ping pong tables and happy hours. It's about a group of people working towards a common purpose, feeling trusted, empowered and supported by their teams, managers and executives. This isn't something that is felt at Synack and it needs to be fixed at the core.","Conduct independent employee engagement and satisfaction surveys and do this now, before more good people leave.

2016-06-06,,,Former Employee ,Labor Arbitrage does not equal innovation,,0,"I worked at Synack for a little over a year. Most people are nice and operate with a constant background of intensity, pressure, and anxiety. This might very well be the norm in the security industry. It's a fun and constantly evolving challenge for those who really like it. There are catered lunches everyday but this seems to be less a perk and more an expectation in startups nowadays. There is decent secular growth in the security sector and the co-founders seem like they might know what they are doing sometimes.","The executive team ranges from generally up-beat, mediocre leaders to downright toxic. There are happy hours on Thursday's but the teams are generally new due to higher than average turnover for a company its size. There is no cohesion between different teams. There is a lot of miscommunication and lack of prioritizing what's important. A good chunk of employees are young and fairly inexperienced in the space. The company has a ""learn-as-you-go"" attitude but this approach is a failure on leadership's part especially because it's now well into series B. So don't expect on-boarding because it will be disorganized at best. There are members of the exec team that have a toxic leadership style that rule by intimidation, act in a disorganized and impulsive behavior, and seem to thrive on public disparagement, which ultimately tears down team morale. There is no strong path for long-term professional development and little in the way for the company taking serious investment in you unless you are in R&D. There is almost a de facto burn and churn mentality. This is not a sustainable business model and neither is outsourcing most of the security work to researchers in foreign countries like India and reselling it for a lot more to domestic clients. Overall, the teams feel disjointed and the culture, although mostly friendly people, feels hollow.","Invest more in long term career growth so employees don't leave after a year or more. Don't speak ill of hires or prospective candidates because that just damages Synack's brand. Raise series C quickly, if you still feel motivated to go all the way with a strong pivot or develop an actual product rather than re-package reports with a cool sales pitch.",1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0
2016-03-12, Business,"Redwood City, CA",Current Employee ,Hidden Gem !,Less than a year,0,"Cybersecurity is HOT that presents a huge opportunity for disruption. Synack has found the right pulse in the space with a truly innovative product that customers love.

In terms of culture, people are super nice, driven and smart. It feels like a family with shared vision to deliver the best. The company also has hired an experienced leadership team with good chemistry which helps the company navigate through the growth phase thoughtfully. Company's co-founders and leadership team is very open to feedback and always tuned in when it comes to improving and doing things better.

In terms of perks, typical startup stuff. Office is tucked away in redwood city with a tiny SF office. As a shareholder can't complain since we don't have to pay outrageous rent in city.

Cherry on top..top tier investors and a board that is highly respected externally and internally.

Upon my first visit to Synack HQ down in Redwood City, I was sold. The people, the passion, the culture, the workplace, the cohesiveness, and the challenge of both a new role and industry focus, made the switch from the corporate world to the early-stage, high-growth environment of Synack a no-brainer.

Pros
- Never a dull day at Synack, challenging environment allowing you to contribute from day one
- Top-tier TALENT- daily collaboration with the brilliant, diverse individuals you're surrounded by
- Exciting, dynamically changing industry and a product that everyone here at Synack believes in
- Fast-paced, high-growth environment
- Friendly, enjoyable, entertaining office culture
- Phenomenal benefits/perks

First time I can honestly say that I ENJOY going to work each day.","Commuting from SF to Redwood City (partly my fault). Rush hour on US 101 is a battle that you just can't win. Take advantage of the free gym membership, events, rec leagues, etc. to avoid the worst traffic times.

The opportunity is well worth the commute; I would never let a commute keep me from doing what I love, and we did just open an office in SF...","Maintain focus on hiring quality vs. quantity.

2015-08-18,,,Former Employee ,Software Engineer,,0,"Synack showed me how fun and rewarding it is to work in security, and I count this internship as the most valuable professional experience I've ever had. I had a fantastic group of mentors who fostered a great sense of camaraderie on our team, and I had a very high level of ownership over the work I did. Everyone I worked with was very patient, knowledgeable, and gave me tons of constructive feedback on my code. I felt like I always had real, meaningful work to do as an intern, and the code I shipped had a measurable impact on the core codebase. Synack is doing really great work and I think the company's leadership is doing a very good job directing the company's mission and goals.

For physical perks, Synack's office is well-furnished and nicely designed, and we had free catered lunches every day, as well as a gamut of snacks and drinks in constant supply. The company also paid for my membership to the gym in the office complex, and we frequently had employees' dogs in the office, a more-than-welcome addition.","Not exactly company-specific, but moving to the Bay Area and finding short-term summer housing was difficult and pretty expensive.

My first startup was on a rocket ship trajectory (I was the 40th employee and I left at 300) and I left do it again at Synack but this time better.

Pros:
1. The space Industrially and physically - Security/CrowdSourcing two of the most interesting trends at the moment with a weight to each of them that consists of more substance than a fad. Crowdsourcing being an incredible way to maximize scale/growth and Security being an amazing field to bring some repairable guidance to the internet that severely needs it. The physical space the company has is a nice addition as well!
2. Very unique perspective derived from employees. The people who work here aren't your typical startup people. They thrive to put themselves in new situations and have a hacking mentality to everything they do whether it be growth, business, web or recreational activities that may involve a kick of adrenaline.
3. There aren't limitations to the groundwork you can contribute as a team member as long as your vision is furthering the company.
