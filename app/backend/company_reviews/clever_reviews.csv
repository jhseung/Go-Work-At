-Awesome opportunities to grow. If you know your stuff, all you have to do is raise your hand and jump in. So many people started as entry-level customer solutions teams and moved into different roles within the team (sales, product, and even partner engineering!). Here, titles don't matter. The hard work you do does.

-Lots of feels- a lot of emotions and feelings to handle...far more so than what is appropriate behavior in the workplace. It felt a little bit like ""The Real World"" at times.
