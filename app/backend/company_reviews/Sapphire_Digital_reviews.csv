Mitch was a great CEO, I'd work with him again. He busted his butt for the company and as a result his team did too. But the new CEO is the opposite. She seems very selfish and disinterested in the company.

Management is willing to spend a lot of money to do things. However they are spending way too much money and for a company that is cash strapped it appears callous and is very risky. There is no corporate culture of saving money in this company at all. And they need to.

There is no promote from within. No career growth at all. To date I've not seen one person get promoted to director, or a director to VP. They always hire from the outside. Don't treat this company as a career but as a stop on your path.

Good location if you live in or near Northern NJ","On-boarding process and interviews give the impression that Vitals' cares about its' employees, but once the work begins, you will realize this:

No formal training process in place, upper management's advice is to ""figure it out.""

High employee turnover which means LOW employee retention. This company isn't in the business of paying more to get quality talent, they'd prefer to hire either: a) green, fresh out of college kids as temps to avoid providing benefits or b) hire decent talent that doesn't realize they are being taken advantage of. When employees are consistently leaving, that says a lot.

It would be rare to find a definitive job spec pertaining to your position pre and post-hire. What they do supply is vague and when you start working you'll end up having work that has absolutely NOTHING to do with why you were hired.

CEO & Founders are primarily interested in turning profit hoping for the chance to be bought out by a larger company or issue an IPO then cash out. Their lack of interest in keeping talented employees not only expresses how cheap they are about paying for talent, but it also demonstrates that people are less important than the product that they are responsible for creating.

A great deal of the Senior Managers lack the education, experience, and knowledge to be in their current roles. They look to people paid awfully and treated horribly for the right answer, then when it backfires they can blame someone other than themselves.

Don't be confused by the offer of 'Unlimited Vacation', the notion sounds wonderful, but the HR department is barely qualified to read a resume, let alone make decisions on vacation and keeping track of the days. If it was truly unlimited, why would someone keep track? That said, the real reason any company (esp. Vitals) offers 'Unlimited Vacation' is so they don't have to pay you for time earned if you choose to leave the company or you get terminated.

Absolutely nothing is planned, designed, developed, tested, and produced in a reasonable time constraint. Mostly everything is a 'drop everything' scenario where you have less time than it would take an expert to complete the assigned task.

They also claim to offer a flexible schedule, but when employees happen to leave earlier than 5:00, regardless of start time, they are reprimanded via some immature game of telephone where everything gets confused and just causes more stress than anything.

Vitals also pretends that they value you and will evaluate your performance for salary purposes, but even IF those meetings occur, you won't see a dime.","Perhaps if any of the management moves to a new company, they would consider building the team from the top down, meaning hire the right senior executives first then let them choose who to hire, and so on. Unfortunately, because the CEO can't say no to any partnership or business deal that involves money, the company was built in a piecemeal fashion.
