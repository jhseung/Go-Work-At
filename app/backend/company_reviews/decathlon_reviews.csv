Employee discount makes the already great deals incredible.,"Upper management is more concerned with self advancement than performing their roles adequately or even competently. Complete lack of team spirit among management with several of the members hustling to simply make themselves look good.

English skills among upper management are middling to poor for a team spearheading a retail expansion to the US. This led to significant lost time due to inability to communicate clearly, and a feeling of inferiority American employees, as conversations among non native English speakers invariably defaulted to French or Spanish.

Constant introduction of new top priorities created lack of focus and progress for the entire organization.

All decision making is at the whim of the CEO who provides no context to his outlandish demands, nor will he speak with anyone but a handful of the expatriate management team. This is completely at odds with their often stated ideal of a ""flat"" organization, where everyone is supposed to feel empowered to take the actions they feel will make a difference.","Immediately stop pouring all resources into garnering social media engagement, and focus instead on fixing the systemic problems at the core of the business.

Specifically:
Insist all upper management is trained in effective people management skills.

Demand all tech and web integrations meet some standard of justification before implementing. Simply thinking a feature is cool is not reason enough.

Hire experts in inventory & warehouse management, and pick/pack operations to ensure you are able to actually ship the items you take orders for.

Advice for future employees: Better be a part-timer: clearly defined responsibilities and good penalty rates for weekends.","- Emphasis on brainwashing employees by exploiting their passion for sports and turning them into retail slaves.
- Preference to backpackers from Europe, toxic work environment with Europeans having little regard to egalitarian Australian working culture.
- Widespread discrimination
- Lying to employees is commonplace.
- Upper Management defensive to suggestions, lying to staff about their potential career and their roles at Decathlon- in our case, the company over hired staff to work during implantation (building the store from scratch which sometimes involved heavy lifting and working in the sun), then 2 weeks after store opening a lot of employees were given redundancy notices citing poor sales. Not a good way to treat the staff, definitely.
- Rostering issues, they use excel and google docs as their rostering platform. Last minute changes to rosters without notifying staff.
- Lack of clear communication regarding company policies.
- Not enough reward for effort: below average pay.
- Little regard for work/life balance.
- Too much emphasis on facing of the products and little about customer experience.","- Hire more Australians in management roles. I understand that it is a European company but you can't have everyone working behind the scenes on Finance, IT, Supply, operations, etc from Europe.
- Restructure, Australia is different from EU/UK, understand the Australian psyche. You are losing out on so much potential.
- Be open to ideas and suggestions and implement them.
- Spend more on Marketing/Media. Digital platforms are good but nothing beats good old radio while driving.
- Be more professional with site feasibility and sales forecasts to avoid over hiring and making people redundant in the future.

In Uxbridge the management was very unprofessional and not organised as they never had previous management experience.

It happened because of no investment in any marketing, no communication at all with the employees and not taking good care of stock. The store manager only reaction to this issue was to fire more employees without giving any warning, feedback before the process.

If you are an sports enthusiast you will be happy to benefit from an employee discount.","In my opinion I would say there is a lack of leadership, responsibility, communication, organization.....

If your first language is English or you have a certain level it is possible that you may find it hard to communicate with your bosses and co-workers possibly leading to misunderstandings and facing a very real and important communicational barrier. Some accents may need special attention to be understand.

The staffs satisfaction does not seem to get to an average level. It looks like people may not raise this topic openly and It seems like employees could find worth it to remain silent.

Personal life-Work life balance is, by far, one of the most unhealthiest I have ever experienced. Concepts seem to be often mistaken, meaning Team Building, as you should never directly or indirectly feel the need to attend social activities in order to be considered an engaged professional/worker. Several, several, extra hours.

Unenjoyable ambience.

In my opinion the salary does not make it.","If there is anyone who will ever read this...

Although I believe what I will say is not deep science but common sense... this is my advise and suggested management lines:

Self criticism is a powerful tool for authentic leaders
Constructive criticism, even any type of non-agressive criticism, should be use as a fuel for motivation and improvement and not be possibly taken as a personal attack or judgement.
The changes needed should be reflected by the leader's exemplary behavior.
Finding the right profile for a position does not finish nor is only focused on the recruitment process, keeping a high level profile requires a high level of leadership.
Empathy is very important.
A leader never sits and wait for other team members to bring all solutions and take all the actions that he/her wish to see. A leader triggers this actions/reactions.
If a management model is proved to not be working, or at some point stopped working over the years, makes sense to put an effort to adapt the model to the real needs, the environment, and the work culture of the country. Why keep swimming against the flow?
