Guys, it's an extremely stressful work load and there is so much to learn to become self-sufficient. The training was vastly lacking, they don't really ease you into it... there was almost zero support, resources are hard to find and out of date, there is no consistency in policies or procedures. Seriously, you could ask 10 different people the same question and get 10 different answers... I've never had a worse job experience. I was consistently ignored by management, my teammates were abrasive and rude when I asked questions (not all of them, and not that I could really blame them, they were stressed out with heavy workloads too)! I had to ask over and over for a specific manager to supply login credentials for the systems needed to do my job -- I was there for about 2 months and still didn't get them all. Some systems would often be down or unavailable, subscriptions to services would constantly run out and would take days to get back up -- it was horribly inefficient, yet they pile the work on you which for a newbie required putting in a ton of extra time after hours and at home. I went to my manager on several occasions asking for some kind of constructive criticism on my work because I just could not keep up with the volume they were dishing out to me... unfortunately, nothing ever happened but I was warned for getting too far behind. I finally had to throw in the towel and quit because I was just too stressed out and really just sick of the way I was being treated. I felt like an outcast, I felt like people were annoyed with me for bothering them with questions... The only excuse Turo has is they are a start-up and are experiencing growing pains... I probably could have put up with that if everyone wasn't so rude and short with me. And I'm not even sorry for saying this, but after working in the claims department for Turo, I will NEVER use their service. It's a nifty idea, but the way they handle their claims is really unfair. That's just my opinion.","It's really nice that you guys like to have a cool place to work... but if you're gonna have the work hard play hard mentality, make sure your newbies are up to speed before you cut them loose. The most frustrating thing was sitting in front of my computer screen, stuck on a claim, and couldn't get a question answered or something approved because everyone else was too busy taking shots at the office... Had I some more time to ease into things, I probably wouldn't have gotten so overwhelmed and given up. Also, it would have been really nice to have had a mentor... just one person that I could have counted on to help answer questions and not just rudely refer me to the silly articles. Those things are not very comprehensive and just confused me more than they helped me.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0

I hope they can continue this trend with the rapid growth we’ve experienced.

The engineering teams shift to Responsive Engineering from Agile Development last summer is a great example of the companies continual focus of improving process. I find the company strikes an excellent balance of empowering employees to make decisions and also fostering a collaborative culture that values outside opinions between teams. They regularly solicit feedback and – more importantly – actually take action to improve upon things that aren’t going well. This is rare and admirable quality to have at an organization, and I greatly appreciate my voice being heard.

The people here are really amazing. We definitely take our time with the hiring process, making sure that ultimately this is somebody I’d like to work with each day, and I think that’s a large part of what’s made Turo what it is. We are more forgiving for inexperience or lack of specific skill-sets if a candidate if eager to learn and passionate about our product. We have employees from all over the globe, and I feel like everyone has their own unique story to tell and interests outside of the tech world.

I also want to mention the incredible level of transparency the company provides into the business. I think it helps align everyones goals and understand that we’re all in this together. It’s kind of fun watching the revenue charts :)","There are some inherent difficulties with a bicoastal office, with some others working remotely as well. Relying on Google Hangouts for communication can be difficult at times, especially when the internet is being fussy, but it’s something we’re trying to improve.
