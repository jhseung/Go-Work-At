Outside of the product organization, there is little leadership strength. The company continues to struggle with execution. Very few employees have any market or industry knowledge/experience which translates into unnecessary learning curves (and time) required before they are truly in a position to bring innovation to the space.

Most come from previous SaaS startups, which would be great if the product was architected as a SaaS offering, but to leverage it's actual value, it can only be deployed as a hosted solution.

There are several excellent engineers and high-performing employees in Product and Client Success at the company but they need more support.","The people responsible for Roostify's engineering success were largely women and engineers of color, many of them without a traditional CS background. These engaging tech leaders have left, though a few still remain.

Another review mentioned leadership changes impacting the quality of work culture. I agree with this assessment. In my experience, since the spring, the company has overworked its competent employees and has done little to address the high turnover, particularly of employees who have been there the longest. There has been an abundance of non-engineering manager hires, many of whom do not understand the product well or what the engineering team actually does. Meanwhile, the engineering team is small (with unrealistic deadlines) and a significant portion of engineering work has been outsourced to contractors. These contractors are not a panacea to larger technical problems, including a lack of vision and simply not having enough horses to ship quality code in a sustainable way.

The company could also benefit from better scoping of new integrations. Those being pushed to execute quickly (and without much technical leadership) are not going to create first-rate products, plain and simple. Employees do not have enough bandwidth for mentorship.

Many high-achieving companies either put underperforming employees under performance review or fire them. Currently, the company is doing neither. This means there is little accountability and work is being handed off to competent employees (and there are few of these staffers who've remained). Those from underrepresented backgrounds also face microaggressions from other employees, including members of their own teams. Management is aware of this behavior and should intervene immediately to rectify problematic actions. If you join this company, please make sure you're paid what you're worth. There's a good chance you will not be paid market rates; negotiate to prevent this.","Please listen. What I've stated above has also been communicated to management by various parties. It'll take a willingness to own up to past mistakes to right this ship and I don't know the likelihood of that.

Most of them have fled the dumpster fire, but we're still in touch.","When I started, Roostify was the company to work for with its great culture, female tech leads, concern for one another's humanity, and some great tech features to build! And then the CTO stepped down, a new guy came in, and pretty soon, all the folks who would know what's going on in the decision-making meetings began to leave. In droves. Droves! Especially the women. But then everyone. There was no one in engineering who wasn't looking.

Meanwhile, when I left, no engineers had been interviewed or hired in over 10 months. Contractors were eventually brought in, but only about 20% filling the vacated positions. And it isn't just engineering that is fleeing that place.

Good news, though: If you look like the folks at the top in ethnicity, gender, and background, there's a good chance they'll hire you! And then you can be incompetent, too! Ask the latest hires how competent they are--don't worry if it takes them awhile to get back to you. I'm sure they're trying to figure out the answer.

TIP: If you're interviewing there, don't tell HR how diversity or respect in a workforce is really important to you. That won't go over well at all.","They won't take it.

If you're not a male you won't be promoted because management prefers to fill leadership positions from outside with white/Indian males. They'd rather hire a nice, pretty resume than someone internally who works really hard.

It's a great place for engineering careers to die. You'll spend most of your time in pointless meetings being yelled at by the clients themselves or yelled at by internal leaders who will defend the clients at any cost. Any semblance of a life you had before you joined Roostify will go away.

But many of us were putting in up to 80 hours a week, working late on weeknights and spending our Saturdays on work and we never so much as received a shout out at the quarterly all hands meetings.

If you prefer to spend your time arguing about what is and isn't technically possible with moronic management who ultimately won't listen to you, this is the job for you.
