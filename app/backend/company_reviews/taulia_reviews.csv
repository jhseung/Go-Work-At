The people here invest a lot of work and compassion into the company and their fellow colleagues, which can often promote a really inclusive culture built on relationships. The leadership is incredibly transparent and hold Q & A's called ""Fireside Chats,"" where we can all gather (through videoconference as well) and discuss issues or questions we all have as employees. They make the roadmap and strategy of the company available to us and involve us all in the process.

Taulia is composed of so many good people all over the world who generally care about the well being of others.

Opportunities for professional development.","There have been a few times that folks have left with a sour taste after being let go for whatever reason, or not agreeing with a leadership decision, which is bound to happen in any company. It can be really vulnerable to lose one's job, so the sentiment is understandable.

Since it is a startup, it also makes sense that there are operational inefficiencies that have grown and needed work in the past (and currently) in most departments. However, many people find that part of it invigorating.

Resources are not always available in the capacity that everyone wants it to be.","Continue to be transparent and treat employees as human beings, and the rest will work out.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

It took years and a whole lot of sweat, frustration and pain to get to this point but now these early payment programs have become a large part of our revenue. Suppliers are never forced to take early payments in return for a discount -- they take early payments because they want and need the money and because the Taulia EP offers are better for them than alternatives (credit cards, factors and buyer P-Card programs are really really costly for suppliers when compared to Taulia financing). Suppliers are not charged a single penny for eInvoicing, PO delivery, visibility into transactions with their customers... on the Taulia network.","Executing on the changes necessary to become a profitable startup company has been challenging but I’d rather work at a self sufficient, profitable company than one desperately holding on from one fund raise to the next as is the case with many of our competitors.",Stay the course and remain focused on our customers.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

- Sales growth is still really great and the company is poised to become profitable next year.
- The company has expanded its product and revenue model in four years by investing heavily is gain share attached to the new SCF+ product which has been built from scratch by the Engineering team.
- The core people at Taulia are quite strong. Smart and good people.
- One person can make an impact at Taulia. You will know the CEO, he will listen to you and know you by name. You can positively influence the products or a business process. That is empowering and fun.
- The new executive group is very business savvy. They aren't quite as fun as some of the old group, but they are what Taulia needs right now. It isn't easy going from where Taulia was, hemoaging cash, to a profitable company. This crew is smart and makes, generally, good business decisions.
- The Engineering group is strong. They have a good work ethic and still apply the core values of the company in what they do. The Product group, once a weakness of Taulia with lots of turnover, has mostly begun to stabilize. The longer tenured portion of Sales is strong as well, with good, impactful sales people.
- There are ups and downs as we continue the journey, but Taulia remains fun and engaging.","- Taulia grew too aggressively in 2014 and has paid the price in 2016 and 2017 with layoffs.
- Culture and values have taken a little hit as the CEO and executive team micromanage it a bit when they should just trust their managers to get the job done. Culture is built from the bottom up, not from the top down.
- There has been some attrition over the last couple years. We have seen some good people leave. There will be some ups and downs at a start up and some people haven't coped well with that, opting for what they perceive as more stable companies. I think people that seek stablility in large companies, may find it. But, they may also find themselves part of a layoff if they have a bad quarter. I guarantee they won't have as much opportunity to positively impact the company.
- Some groups have lost sight of our core values, adopting large corporate processes that neither help get things done faster nor foster connection. But this is only a couple of groups.
- S.F., the head office, no longer feels like the cultural Mecca it once was. Other sites like Sofia, Austin, and Park City carry on parts of S.F.'S once great culture. This makes it a little harder for new employees to visit any one site to see what Taulia is about.","- Core values used to be a bigger part of who we were as Taulians.

2017-08-10,,,Current Employee ,A little weird and no longer fun,More than a year,0,"Benefits: Taulia still has good perks and benefits.

People: Most of the people working there are very talented.

Location: The main office is in San Francisco’s financial district, but there are many offices around the US and in Europe. Remote office is an option.","Management: With seemingly little experience in the technology industry, senior management clings almost cultishly to mantras, like being “fun and weird” or “fish in the pond”, while the company is behind target. Monthly all hands meetings and “fireside chats” feel more like a circus than a professional company meeting.

Product: Taulia software has become a collection of fixes and on/off switches. Instead of addressing critical issues, many teams cultivate pet projects, like new buttons or screen labels, that add very little value and often don’t even work.

Culture: I really believe that almost everyone at Taulia wants to succeed, but the company has become lost. Many people seem to follow procedure without knowing why and just do things because they are told to. People are frustrated and employee morale is very low.

Organization: Taulia is a technology company, but most in senior management have a finance background. As a result, they seek improvement by changing financial parameters in the organization, like changing the bonus plan and now lay offs again, while the core software product deteriorates.","You are ultimately responsible for the situation at Taulia. But instead of owning it or maybe even asking the different teams what can be done to improve the situation, you wait until it is too late, suddenly ramble something about how “a company has to be profitable”, and lay off people that were actually doing work making it even worse for those left behind.

Has ultimately become a lifestyle company.","Tons of turnover in Marketing, Sales, nearly all Solution Consultants are gone, the partner team is a revolving door.

Lack of executive leadership! The executive leadership are genuinely good people, however they have zero experience, zero market intelligence and zero plan. This is very different from the days when the founders ran the company and drove the strategy. The company has unfortunately lacked all humility and has convinced themselves that they're the market leader in supplier financing, yet in all honesty they rely completely on their finance partner for market intelligence. The product is in dire straights and zero product development for years now. All of the product improvements are ""fixes""...nothing new or innovative. Implementations and account management is all over the place.

Generally speaking Taulia is still more concerned about creating a weird ""cool"" culture more than creating a mature, professional and accountable culture. It's time for Taulia to grow-up, become humble once again and find real leaders with a vision and with executive experience. Time is running out.

I'm not there anymore.","They tout all this team activity - but actually do something maybe twice a year, and it's only very local - while the managers get to go off multiple more times to offsites that are at really neat places - leaving the rest of the employees to drudge away at a failing technology.

The managers (in at least the engineering department) don't have much of any insight into what actually needs to be put in to their application from testing to release - and have begun to harbor a morale busting approach of disparaging engineers rather than being fully supportive in actually getting the work done.

They do not assign work that applies to the career path an engineer has followed up to working here - as such it makes people either keep working for them in technologies they don't want to work in - or they are forced to try and find new work after having gotten rusty at what they used to be good at.","Be supportive to your team members - using thinly veiled excuses to punish people who are doing their best only serves to make you look like horrible people who I would strongly suggest against working for. The higher management needs to do some realization that their subordinates are causing massive drops in morale - and the teams I worked with do not enjoy working under the current management, with many looking to move elsewhere after they relearn the skills this company forced them to move away from.

The final pro: The Best Location For Most Commuters!!! The corner building is a block away from the Transbay Bus Terminal, a couple of blocks from Embarcadero BART station, three blocks from casual carpool, and surrounded by tons of eateries for the days that Taulia doesn't provide free lunches.

People who don't take themselves to seriously, who are humble, yet immensely talented and intelligent. The best talent is hired and then promoted from within. I've never had a conversation with a Taulian who didn't ask how they could help be successful. I've never heard a Taulian respond with ""it won't work"" but instead they propose ""here's what it would take to make that successful"". Management is always open and seeks diverse and dissenting opinions, measures the feedback, and responds with either why or why not that opinion is adopted. They are fair but firm and consistently ask and weigh ""is my decision in the best interest of Taulia, my customer, and my employees"".

2015-09-03, Director of Engineering,"Park City, UT",Current Employee ,Taulia Does It Right,,0,"I've been kicking around the software industry for a while and Taulia is by far the best place I've ever worked. Here's why.

1) Taulia takes the well-being of their employees seriously. This means employees have managers that care about their career progression, that listen to their feedback and more importantly act on it. They acknowledge a job well done and celebrate success. Everyone is approachable. If you want to talk to the CEO, talk to him, there are no barriers, because everyone knows that they matter.

2) Taulia has a great product. There aren't many companies where you can honestly say that everyone wins. Taulia makes it easier to process invoices and helps make the buyer a lot of money helping to improve efficiency and foster early payment discount capture. This makes the buyer happy. The supplier, with a click of a button can submit an invoice and elect to get paid early. They take a little ding on what they get paid, but if they need the money, the rates are better and it is a heck of a lot easier than getting a loan from the bank. The supplier is happy. The buyer pays us a little bit and we are happy too.

3) We invest in our infrastructure. It is important to engineers to be working on the latest greatest stuff, stuff that makes them better. We take time to progress our architecture in a positive way. We are a software company. There is legacy, but we take the time to address it and make it move in the right direction. There is buy in for this across the entire organization.

4) Senior management is great. They work together cohesively. They are smart and employees can trust that Taulia is headed in the right direction. They can trust that if they do their part the company will be successful.

The future is bright for Taulia and I'm proud to be a part of it.","I'm consistently surprised how behind the times so companies are in terms of electronic invoicing, discount capital management, etc. This can be a barrier during implementations.",Keep it up!,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Community and collaboration is a big part of the team.
The monetary compensation is fair compared to the market - but you don't work here just for the money. You work here to have a position in a really strong, low-ego team that pulls in the same direction to achieve great things. If you are looking for a 9-5 job that pays well and doesn't require you to step up your game and get better at what you are doing then this is the wrong place.
The team strives for customer satisfaction, business-case delivery and building a great company. Not just for ""a job"".
The new office locations outside of SF (Park City, Utah; Austin, TX; London, UK; Sofia, Bulgaria) are really tied into the overall community and there is no 2nd-class citizen at Taulia ever - from the intern up to the C-level team everybody is treated well and people value everybody's work. I could not have joined a better team at a better time.","Hiring the competitive markets that Taulia is in there are sometimes people joining for the wrong reasons. They leave relatively soon - but Taulia could be even better by making sure the wrong people don't stick around for the wrong reasons. It is hard to sustain this really fast growth and only hire great people - but Taulia could be even better at parting ways from the ones who are not a great fit.

You probably won’t be successful, or C-level management, if you don't fall within the current paradigm of male, under 40, straight and white.

2015-10-02, Supplier Integration Specialist,Sofia (Bulgaria),Current Employee ,Taulia review - Gabriela Nikolova,Less than a year,0,I have joined Tauliia 3 months ago coming from a similar professional background. My first and overall impression of Taulia is that the company really cares about its employees. Taulia has an amazing company culture where employees feel as they belong to the Taulia family. Team members and the management are very approachable and I have felt welcome since day 1!,"We have recently faced some stressful work situations, however we have overcome them as a team effort.","I am overall happy with my management.

2015-10-09, Consulting Solutions Director,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Top company with loads of energy!,,0,"Started about 3 months ago being one of the new members of the European sales team. Things I like so far are:

- very good onboarding procedures
- great atmosphere
- everybody seems to be on the same page and is helping each other
- loads of freedom to organise your work well
- clear goals set by management
- everybody is very enthousiastic which gives extra energy
- good compensation packages

All in all I am one of the proud Taulians and hope and expect to stay one for a long time to come","Couple of minor things:

- a lot of online /internal meetings are held at US west coast time zone. For Europeans this sometimes means meetings very late on the day (between 6:00-10:00 pm)
- To control costs, some approval process would make sense especially as we are growing rapily",Stay focused on the goal. Keep an eye on costs and keep organising fun stuff!,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0
2015-08-05," Senior Director, Partner Programs, Operations & Enablement","London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Day 3 - Taulia Experience,Less than a year,0,"Taulia has a sense of purpose, a belief and is creating a movement. We have a mission to boost the global economy and change the world by improving the way businesses interact with their supply chain.

We not only help companies achieve significant savings through operational efficiencies, and align to their strategic initiatives through compelling balance sheet improvements, but also help accelerate the global economic recovery by radically changing the way the world's largest companies partner with their supply chain. We help companies create more jobs, produce more goods and help control the planet's climate through greener, paperless initiatives.

Compelling and globally disruptive.

I joined Taulia, because we don't need to talk about the Cloud. Yes, all solutions are delivered 100% cloud, but this is no longer a big deal. Those who are still stressing about Cloud adoption and UX, have been disrupted. The world has moved on. Taulia only sells business value - the products are merely the vehicle to achieve it.

Taulia's culture is one that reminds me of SuccessFactors from when I joined. The employees have a motivational purpose, are encouraged to join the movement to change the world, to be leaders, to create our own future, to go forth and disrupt, to believe in our mission and most importantly: Get s**t done! We are not prohibited, we are all Intrepreneurs.

Taulia is the next big thing - and I'm here to make a difference. We're significantly expanding our employee-base, our lucrative partner ecosystem and of course, our customer base with 21 consecutive quarters of growth and 116% YoY growth for Q2-2015. Our founders even have cool beards!","So far none. It's important for prospective employees and new starters to keep an open mind and ensure your expectations remain in check. Taulia is not a $1bn company - yet. Taulia is in startup mode, therefore every employee needs to think like an entrepreneur - or rather an intrepreneur (look it up).

Your role and career at Taulia will be what you make out of it - so learn to swim fast. There is a very high chance joining Taulia will be the best career move you ever make.","Keep everything simple, global, avoid TLAs, embrace creativity and design thinking.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2014-02-19, European Marketing Director,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Exciting place where you can get things done!,Less than a year,0,"I've only been at Taulia for a short amount of time so this review is necessarily limited. However, the reasons that I joined are extremely clear to me and I've not been disappointed by the reality in any way so far. I wanted an interesting and challenging role where I can work in a fast paced environment with people who are motivated to succeed and want to work together to achieve this.

This is a company with a real vision which isn't just about how much money they are aiming to make for the investors, but rather how they want to make their customers lives better (achieve this and the money will follow anyway). For me I like the idea of buying into that vision and it makes it clear where we're going and how I fit in. It's also a company that has a very laid back style, focusing on results and working together rather than lots of formality. The plus side of this is that you are very much in charge of your own destiny here. The downside is that I suspect that if you're a person that needs to be given lots of direction, it isn't going to suit you.

There are also a couple of key attributes which I really like. Firstly, Taulia has an extensive and very open communication style and it uses as many tools as possible to make this easy. Secondly, I find the senior management both easy to approach and to engage in dialogue. This is definitely not a one way command and control culture. In a young company that is growing fast both of these attributes are critical for our future success.

Lastly, there's a comment that we're over hiring. I deliberately took a marketing job here a couple of levels down from where I could have been employed. That means I willingly and knowing do everything from strategy setting through to putting up a booth. It's an active choice I took and I took it because I want to be part of the Taulia experience and so far it's more than worth it!",I have to go and get my own coffee! (but there is free fruit and drinks),"Keep communicating a very clear vision, continue empowering people to do their jobs, don't be tempted to slip into command and control because you think you know better (we're all here to learn as well) and keep trying to make the ride fun!",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
2012-08-09,,,Current Employee ,"Successful, Strong Product Focus, Work Hard & Play Hard, international network",Less than a year,0,"(1) Very strong product and engineering team: foundation of the company and it shows, product development is a serious and fun process. General enthusiasm about helping clients

(2) Visionary and Domain Experts: this is a team that knows its stuff; the cofounders all worked together and sold a company that is in adjacent market. This experience and more importantly understanding, means that clients and customers like the knowledge they bring to the table.
Overall, the executive team is more technically sound than most of I have seen in my experience. The nice thing is that you have a team that really understands how their product fits into clients IT ecosystem which is huge.

(3) Traction and Real Customers: there really is not hype here, its tough to start a enterprise software company and build one with real customers. Taulia has broken through that and really now taking off. The hardest thing to do is landing a blue chip customer with no references, but today with names like Coca Cola, John Deere, Pepco, PG&E, Pfizer, Warner Brothers and others - there are more customers calling in; makes the overall sentiment for the team better.

(4) Great Investors: Matrix, DAG, and Trinity are all top-tier funds. Matrix - initial investor in Apple, Quora, Zong (acquired by PayPal),

(5) Great well rounded group
-There is a great mix of backgrounds and countries represented. Great mix of international team members. Very rare to find this in the Bay Area, if you are looking for a great startup experience that values time off and travel this is a great option.

Overall, if you are looking for a well funded, international team, that has real customers (with investors fighting to get in and fund the company), and visionary founders this is the place for you.","(1) Hardwork - this is a startup and there is a lot to do
(2) No place to hide - no layers here, you interact with everyone and its very clear if you are not pulling your weight
(3) Open and honest environment - people here are upfront and direct, sometimes thats to much to handle
(4) Start-up fast paced - there is a sense of urgency, products move fast, sales team move fast; there is not waiting around for things
(5) Leverage technology tools: this company is huge in using technology to make things happen faster - from email, to social media (yammer), to communicate with people all over the world (skype) and using collaborative tools - you need to be comfortable using different technologies to make your life easier and get more work done","(1) Staying focused on hiring the best and brightest
(2) Develop a formal mentoring and development program to cultivate talent
(3) Keep startup-feel and not take things seriously
(4) Stay discipline - in everything from hiring, results, things to focus on; the biggest distraction at this stage for a company is to get lazy, hire freely, make the hard decisions, its all a part of the process -",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
