2019-04-11, Product Manager,"Brooklyn, NY",Former Employee ,Avoid Product Management,More than a year,0,"1. Positive mission and purpose, the customers are inspiring and loyal. And there is still a lot of potential in the marketplace to help them thrive.

2. The engineering team is full of collaborative and talented people.

3. The compensation, benefits, work/life balance and facilities are all really solid and a good model for others to follow.","1. Communication and data between teams doesn't flow freely but rather siloed and selectively. A handful of negative players appear to thrive here creating unhealthy friction.

2. The PM role lacks a strategic outlook and there is limited growth opportunities. Most are essentially pushed to manage projects, not deliver outcomes.

3. The PM org is being run by someone that never worked as a product manager w/ a management team that hasn't led product at scale for consumer tech businesses.

4. It's not a learning culture. At the end of every quarter, for example, there is a freakout, reshuffling of teams, tactics, etc. because some unrealistic goal(s) won't be hit.","1. Bring in experienced PM leadership. PM management that has worked hands-on on highly-scaled, complex, consumer businesses besides Etsy.

2. Reexamine strategic objectives process - how, who, and when KPIs are determined, reported, etc. - and how you decide desired customer outcomes and what to build.

 3. Work on people and culture. The mission is hypocritical if people aren't being decent humans to each other. HR seems to be an enabler too. See reorgs, ongoing turnover, hire and fire comments for evidence.",3.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0

Etsy has some of the kindest, smartest, and most diligent employees that I've had the opportunity to work with. I don't feel like I'm competing with my coworkers, but rather that we're working towards a common goal, and supporting each other along the way.

There is a wide surface of technical challenges and products to work on, and everything is making progress at a fast pace.

We have a culture of sharing knowledge, so if you have a question, you can approach anyone in the company (a bit of a double-edged sword).

Compensation and benefits are pretty good. While not top-tier, I feel that I was made a very respectable offer coming in, and they give generous raises and bonuses according to your performance. The benefits are pretty good (401K, health, dental, life, a bunch of extras).","Some of the technology is a bit dated, and there's a (responsible and well-intentioned) conservatism about modernizing tools and infrastructure. We are making progress on this.

The open-office layout is not good at all for concentration. There are a ton of distractions, ESPECIALLY slack.

Some restructuring has caused gaps in coverage of legacy systems. This should be addressed.

-However, I’m an afterthought for meetings that actually would be helpful for me, but I’m not invited to them. Then I’m berated for not knowing something that was discussed in those meetings.

-Which leads to communication, which is terrible here. Obtaining relevant information and answers that is crucial for me to do my job effectively is like pulling teeth.
-People in leadership and product management roles don’t seemed to be equipped or experienced enough to handle their job responsibilities. Stop putting 23-year-olds in charge of entire product verticals. They lack the experience and confidence to get the job done.
-PMs and designers get in their own way and overthink products.Don’t seem to really be listening to what buyers or sellers actually need.
- I'm surprised by how cold and/or unhappy so many people seem here. I was expecting a much warmer, friendlier group of people.

This often can feel like chaos. As mentioned in the Pros section, everybody who works there truly cares about the company and their projects and strives to be helpful, but there can still be a lot of friction and overhead when it comes to resolving project conflicts (deadlines, staffing, etc).

2017-11-09, Software Engineer,"Brooklyn, NY",Current Employee ,"I'm Lucky That I Can Say ""I Love My Job",More than a year,0,"As an engineer, I love Etsy's culture of curiosity. While industry standard best practices are of course important and are the standard for good reasons, it never hurts to explore and experiment with alternative approaches. Having experienced Etsy from an inside perspective for over a year now, I can definitely attest to the increased freedom, benefit and satisfaction from exercising the curiosity culture in my day-to-day work.

As a human and just ""I want to work so I can live my life"" perspective, Etsy's benefits, culture (not necessarily just engineering culture), work-life balance and many other aspects hit the spot for me. Etsy is definitely a people-oriented company and while all the initiatives and projects ultimately reflect that people-oriented mindset, it also reflects nicely in the company culture for employees, too.","Purely as an engineer, there's just one relatively minor point. Having started as a small startup back in 2005, there are definitely remnants of a bygone era of ""wild west coding"" at Etsy. New code that gets churned out nowadays is honestly fine, but it's not entirely rare to come across a codebase that has a lot of legacy code in it still.

With some of the shakeups in the past half a year (As of November '17), there've also been some re-orgs and while it was overall positive and a great change in my opinion, naturally there are still some kinks to be worked out.

That said, I want to keep it clear that the above two points are actively being worked on, at least within the teams I interact with. They're just points to keep in mind given recent events.","Honestly, great job. I was honestly skeptical about the company's future half a year ago. Now? I'm so stoked. I'm excited.

Some recent negative reviews are exaggerated and dramatic, which is more of a reflection of the company putting too much emphasis on ""culture"" and not always hiring the best and most experienced workers for the job. There's a lot of entitlement, which continues to shock me, as not all companies are going to give paid health benefits, very generous sick and PTO, and a terrific work/life balance. I hear everyone talk about the ""old"" Etsy a lot which included poor product planning, subpar engineering, and major lack of communication across the company. We're finally stepping in the right direction, but I don't feel like Josh is the right fit for Etsy. He has the business expertise, which we desperately need, but it's clear he lacks the ability to manage a company that's so protective of their culture . He's alienated a lot of employees and excelerated attrition, which at one time was curtly referred to as ""natural"". While we've improved GMS and attracted new members to the site, a lot of products are broken and need to be addressed. Engineering time is now impossible to get because of the wave of attrition in engineering. The loss of a lot of people has in itself pros and cons, but since they arrogantly didn't think this many would actually leave, HR has been super slow to backfill the positions leaving the remaining employees with having to pick up the extra work. Josh and the executive team at one point made it seem as if we all werent willing to pitch in and we needed to essentially grow up to act like adults, which also turned a lot of employees off and gave them an extra push to leave. Unfortunately, this alienated a lot of hard working employees who had been picking up the slack, so I'm not surprised ""natural"" attrition has drastically increased. It should've only been addressed directly to the employees with a bad attitude, not to the entire company.","-- Review your management teams and ensure they are performing. In my org alone, there were two managers who never had a clue about anything but were pulling triggers on decisions.
-- Continue to review management levels and cut the fat. Josh likes to talk about cutting down on bureaucracy, but it's not entirely true. There is a lot more work to be done here. There is one team with Senior Managers and then Managers. The senior managers are no help and have no idea what's going on with their teams. Additionally, I have four different levels of bosses I need to go through to get things addressed. This is a major problem when one boss doesn't want to bring things up to her/his boss because she/he thinks it'll make her/him look bad. This is just bad management.
-- Allow your employees to be completely and 100% honest with their questions and concerns to upper management and executive levels. When the layoffs happened, there was a lot of confusion, worry, and anger. People were asking hard questions and venting. This is human nature.

Three years ago, having unlimited sick days, decent PTO, free snacks and a couple of lunches a week felt like actual perks, whereas now this is industry standard (not to mention Etsy has cutback on all of these things tremendously following massive layoffs and restructuring). The main pros I can think of is just experience. For anyone who isn't coming from a tech background, you can learn a lot here (as long as you make it your business to learn, and push your way into experiences, which is not always easy).","I had several experiences at Etsy that I felt were based in sexism and misogyny, a few of which I escalated to HR and upper management. I felt I was dismissed, and was told the issue would ""resolve itself."" After a few years at Etsy, I could really see that there is a lot of darkness here, at least in certain organizations. Women are not always empowered to speak up about their compensation, career trajectory, or general experiences within the company. I can't speak for the men there, so I don't know how their experience differs. I would caution any young women working here to be really tough on their managers to ensure they are receiving proper compensation. I left Etsy never being compensated for a large portion of the work I had done.","Start realizing that people no longer will work for free because of ""perks."" Perks don't pay the bills or put food on the table.

+ Great location for people who live in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. Close to the F and A/C subway lines. Bike friendly.

+ Pet-friendly.","- Massive attrition of employees in last four months beyond the two big layoff rounds. We're just getting started. There are more departures in waiting as people are holding out on next vesting period (10/1) or other job options. Backfills are not keeping up and it's even harder now to attract the talent that the company desperately needs like data science, search, and other engineering needs. It won't matter what the ""strategy"" of the company is if it doesn't have the capabilities to execute against those goals.

- Lack of focus still persists and senior execs are all trying to position themselves as ""thought leaders"" with Josh (CEO). It's like watching kids fighting for dad's attention. Minimal transparency with employees, more corporate speak, and almost no effort on retention during first 3 months, which has resulted in a yet to be realized wave of departures that will definitely accelerate later this year. Strategy without execution just leads to unachievable goals. And not squad goals.

- Seems like investors are enthusiastic that someone will buy the company. Buyer beware and, for prospective employees, have you seen the stock price?

The re-orgs are endless. Constant chaos. Next to impossible to get anything done or move your career forward. Upper management is never willing to try new ideas or innovate because that costs money, so constantly lagging behind industry standards for customer experience and e-commerce best practices.

No useful performance review system and non-competitive salaries (meaning, you have to leave to get a raise or promoted). Office politics are out of control and the corporate mind games have become the new norm.

What once was an exciting place to work with opportunities to feel like you were truly contributing is now a top-down corporate dictatorship that's all about the $$$—not about people, not about planet, just about profit. No transparency, no ""we're in this together,"" no mission, no goals beyond make money NOW (or else).

The lack of respect for the company culture that made Etsy a great place to work is obvious. Morale is the lowest I've ever encountered and no one knows if they'll have a job tomorrow. After the layoffs, there's been a mass exodus of talent, and Etsy is going to be a completely different company in a year's time. I don't want to be there to see it.

So, advice to management: please lose the empty corporate jargon; no one understands it or appreciates it (same goes for the sports references—this is Etsy, we're a bunch of artsy fartsy people, not football players). And if you want everyone to now do the job of three people when morale is this low, be transparent and actually involve them in decision making, not just execution. Share a mission that's not just about money and trying to convince everyone that Etsy is a ""typical retail company"" (it's not). Trust the talent you have, or they’ll go somewhere they are.

While we’re at it, work out a review system that actually allows people to progress their careers (and don’t just keep saying it’s “coming soon"" or that you only promote people twice a year). And if you keep hinting that benefits are going to be reduced, be ready for half the company to leave, because that's the only thing keeping them there.

Etsy's hiring process is heavily focused on culture fit, and they do a really great job. I can truly say that I love many of my coworkers.","-The member operations teams are designed for fast turnover and little career development.
-The starting salary was $10,000 less than comparative customer support and trust and safety teams.
-There is little availability from management to support the career development of the agents. The customer support teams are over 100 people so career development into product, policy, or project management is no longer possible-- as those roles have already been filled. Overall, it's a fine place to learn about tech support and operations, but not the best place to learn about operations management, project management, data analysis, or policy writing.

There's also a lot of sexual harassment from men in the company, and a lot of pressure from women in the company to bend in to it. Nothing over the top ever happened, but I can absolutely say with confidence that I felt like a ""woman"" every day there, and it was made very clear to me that the vibe of the company is to date everyone like it was a college campus. I didn't realize how much that pressure was affecting me until I went to a tech company with a ""less cool, more work"" vibe, and it's just a better fit for me. To each her own.","-Take care to develop career paths for member operations agents

Everyone keeps a close watch on the door and only talented, non-jerk ambitious kind people come on board. There are very few locked doors. If you have the time and ambition to make something better, you can, and you own it, and no one makes unreasonable demands of you.","The downside to having lots of opportunity and potential is that you might often feel guilty about not doing more. So if that applies to you, be wary.

The product decisions are traditionally all made by committee. This often leads to underwhelming products even though everyone is talented, because this culture of being kind leads to few coherent decisions and a lot of input from a lot of people ends up washing out more pointed ideas.

Also the size is ridiculous and this is due to reasons inherent to a venture capital sort of company, they just need to have a lot of employees. The more employees the stronger the company seems and the more growth they can realize. This has made the company change from a giant family to more of a ""normal"" segmented business where no one knows anyone else but, as we are all employed here, we are part of the ""size"" of the company, and it's hard to complain about.","Please continue to focus on the principals, just hire kind people who know their stuff. There are probably a lot of smart people no one wants to work with. As for current reports, just be sure people take pride in what they do. Some people want to drive and haven't been able to and left, and I realize other people don't want to drive, but both types still want to have pride in their work.

It seems important to be aware of the balance between A) ""heavy handed"" product decisions and B) a culture that allows input from everyone. I can't say how to balance them perfectly, maybe it's impossible, but it's important to see. Things seem to fall safely on the side of the latter. Decisions are driven by engineering and everyone has a say, which makes it fun and things rarely come strictly from with a top-down direction. This leaves room for people to imagine products that could be more coherent and effective were there a strongly guided, focused voice. Is this true? I don't know. But it always comes up. People frequently say our effort isn't focused enough on specific ideas.

2015-04-09,,"Brooklyn, NY",Former Employee ,"Disorganized, High School Atmosphere",More than a year,0,"Work alongside some very creative and interesting people who live very rich lives. It's a great place for the young and single. Engineering culture is very strong, almost to the point of letting a technological style dictate a product experience.","""Keep it real"" is the company's motto, but there is constant smokescreen and double-talk on everything. Despite the fact that ""Loose Lips Sink Ships"" as they say at every all hands meeting, gossip and rumor is usually how you receive most of your information. This isn't due to the clique-like culture, which is pervasive (Regina George in the C-Suite is forming her own team of Mean Girls to worship her since she left the financial world), but more because the top management isn't aligned at all on what needs to get done, most of all the CEO, who is more of a cultural tour guide than a leader.

The product experience has languished from years with no leader, and there is so much experience debt to dig out of that growth is constrained. Speaking of growth, don't consider being promoted. They're so worried about upsetting anyone, they rarely promote from within the ranks with the exception of the few anointed who don't threaten the egos of the top dogs. They are more likely to hire from outside than to nurture their own talent, because management experience is poor throughout.

Lastly, Etsy just simply wastes a lot of money and is badly run. Many departments are bloated, the office is rarely humming before 10:30, and you might see people around the office just doing whatever they want under no apparent direction.
