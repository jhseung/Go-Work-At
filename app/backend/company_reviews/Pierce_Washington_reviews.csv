I really like the people I work with and appreciate all the times we've saved the day for each other on shared projects.","Looking forward to a more diverse firm as the years go by. Gender/ethnic diversity is a shortcoming at most tech companies, not just Pierce Washington. I have seen the diversity of the firm increase since I started, but it's still something that should be focused on and intentionally improved. If the majority of our hires are references, they'll typically share similar demographics to the person referring them. Diversity of experience, gender, and ethnic background makes us better, stronger, and smarter.","Trust your vision for the firm and for your projects, keep being tough with clients when needed, and keep talking to each other.
