-Ongoing training to help you keep up to date with markets, regulations, laws, and products.
-Good comp compared to other companies
-Plenty of room for growth
-Entrepreneurial role","No sugar coating here; the job and industry itself is very, very difficult to start. Don't expect to ride a rocket ship to the top. This isn't really AWP itself but more the entire financial advising world. Then again, building a business from scratch is never easy.

They have a lot of marketing materials to use but in my honest opinion, they are a little outdated. The firm also is a little behind on overall marketing strategies, but compliance makes it difficult to begin with (thanks FINRA).

Learning how to sell products and your services is good, but there is no follow through in the training process on how to handle the steps afterwards. It's more of a ""trial and error"". This often delays pieces of business from getting done sooner. Also, potentially makes the advisor look foolish in front of the client.",The only thing I would like to see for future Advisors coming in that are new to the business is furthering the training to include how to handle different cases and specific product and business paperwork.,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Support staff is meager and advisors have to pay for everything including computer, office supplies, platform fees, and office support.

Good place for those wishing to enter into finance. Great pay out percentage","No salary. There is a subsidy but it's only active if performance numbers are hit.
