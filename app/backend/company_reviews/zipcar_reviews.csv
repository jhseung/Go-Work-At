2018-06-15,,"Boston, MA",Former Employee ,A business whose glory is in the rear view mirror,More than a year,0,"The main upside of working at Zipcar is the opportunity to work with some decent people. Tucked between the layers of inertia and routine, there are some genuinely kind and intelligent people. And God bless 'em, many folks there still feel a passion and commitment for the cause - which might be the sole redeeming thing about the business.

The office is also quite nice. :-)","The business is dying. Every meaningful metric - customer base, revenue, operating margin, etc. - is SHRINKING. And rapidly. To be clear, when the biggest business win entails celebrating staff and cost reductions in order to register a quarterly profit, you understand the business isn't long for this world.

Stale tech - despite many years of investment in the core ""platform,"" the business operates on tech from 10+ years ago that has long shown its limitations. Add to that the fact that this investment has been mismanaged for years by the product and engineering ""leadership,"" and the future looks even dimmer.

""Leadership"" - the exec team consists largely of director-level people who have fallen up into their current roles (engineering, finance and particularly inept former marketing and HR leads). Ironically, they tend to operate and communicate as if they were leading a large company. (PSSST...YOU'RE NOT.) They report into a president who a) can't hide her distaste for the staff she inherited and b) is incapable of articulating a vision for the business - perhaps because she also can't see it.

Be forewarned - the allure of the brand does not measure up to the operating reality.","Try - just try - to inspire your people, and back it up with actions. For God's sake, listen to your teams. Stop treating feedback with such outright distaste. Turn the company around.",2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

And all the good people you get to work with on a daily basis. Only the brand isn’t so relevant anymore… er… and I guess a lot of the ‘good’ people are now Zipcar alumni working elsewhere. Hmmm. Ah… So the good news is - when someone leaves Zipcar, there is usually a going away party. This happens more frequently lately. At those parties, it is usually a good time to re-connect with some of this old Zipcar alumni that was so great to work with a few years ago. So we got that going for us, which is good.","I want to give a glowing 5 Star review here, however, that Zipcar only exists in my mind from a time several years back. No - things weren’t perfect back then, but the culture was good. It was fun. Scrappy. There was passion. Belief in the mission. People gave 110%. Not so much anymore. Lots of great people have left and many continue to do so at a high rate. New folks that come in tend to have a few ‘face palm’ moments and ask themselves ‘what did I get myself into…?’ The energy and passion was sucked out of the room in 2017. There is poor leadership at the very top that results in a very frustrating and polarizing place to work (lots of contradicting direction, lack of clarity, void of a strategy that will help reverse the declining growth trend (hint - cars are dirty, prices are too high, more convenient options are out there)). The culture has evaporated and there is virtually no energy or enthusiasm left. Most people have checked out and are looking forward to an easy / coasting summer before looking for the next gig in the fall.","It’s great that we are finally (finally!) paying attention to product, however, boy should we feel bad for those product and engineering folks - so much baggage for them to clean up before actually getting to working on real product. We are ’Re-platforming’ for the 3rd straight year while the world adapts around us. It’s hard to move fast because everything is so much harder to get done at Zipcar than it should be (everyone remember a wasted, un-necessarily difficult year of ‘One>Way’ we’ll never get back?). And why did we stop investing in marketing or member services? Those teams worked tirelessly with continually questioned and eroding resources to keep this a strong enough brand that users just might (maybe) look past the product and service warts and still use us. Their insights and strategies have been right but they just get beat up. And for goodness sake - to our dear finance and analytics leaders - now that you’ve driven most people from your team out of the organization, perhaps you can work on some EQ skills? Instead of crapping all over everybody and everything that doesn’t come from your teams, maybe you can contribute in some positive ways vs. further killing the culture?

2017-11-03, Software Engineer,"San Mateo, CA",Current Employee ,"Zipcar in San Mateo, CA: The greatest ""skunk works"" office you've never heard of",Less than a year,0,"Zipcar in general:
* a real part of the future of transport, and impact a million members in a practical way, not just social media.
* a real product, not just selling ads.
* you won't be exploiting anyone with gig jobs.
* a chance to as part of Avis shape the future of a 100 year old transportation company, and maybe even the future of transportation overall.
* the new President (Tracey Zhen) is really sharp and is doing a good job of getting Avis to see us as a strategic resource, and not just as another brand to make profitable by cutting costs.
* relatively BS-free engineering culture, good emphasis on quality.
* free zipcar membership, huge employee discount on weekday zipcar use, huge employee discounts (after some months tenure) on Avis rental cars

Zipcar West in particular:
* Great engineering talent, with a great collaborative culture
* A small team which operates like a start-up in some of the best ways, can execute very quickly, free of BS processes, very little ""not my job,"" opportunities to work on just about anything in the business, and really smart people.
* None of the bad parts of a startup (except maybe understaffing and facilities) -- a huge emphasis on work life balance and sustainable pace. Great technical culture. Several of the cofounders of the startup that Zipcar acquired were French and that comes through in the office culture.
* Downtown San Mateo has TONS of good lunch places, many of them inexpensive.
* Funky, very distinctive office space (but see below) in downtown San Mateo, like 100 feet from Caltrain. Free access to test vehicles which is a huge plus if you live in the city and don't have your own (and few enough people in the office that they're usually available if you need them.)
* Relatively accessible to free parking if you come from someplace not accessible to Caltrain.","While for the most part we execute like a startup in San Mateo, the behemoth of Avis as a whole is less than agile, and the home office support staff in Boston means well but is away.

Other cons of Zipcar in general:
* If you're reading this in 2017, there's a lot of legacy code and the technical platform is very much in flux. With any luck, that won't be true if you're reading this much of the way into 2018.
* There are tremendous cost controls, and we're relatively short on Bay Area standard tech ""perks""; the Boston office is even less so. See above about unique perks, however.
* We're part of a big, non-tech company so while salaries are pretty much at market, what you see is what you get there -- there's no equity, but see above for work-life balance.

Cons specific to the San Mateo office are:
* we're understaffed and recruitment has been slow -- although management is very good about keeping goals realistic, and we've got headcount.

* the funky office space we're in (while also a plus) is a little crowded, and it's definitely not the most practical office space. If you can't be patient with sometimes flaky A/C and wifi and having no fallback beyond other engineers and an office manager when something goes wrong, this is probably not the place for you. :)
* What parking there is somewhat inconvenient, either in a long driveway (e.g. coworkers to ask to move) or several blocks away in a residential neighborhood.","Zipcar in general: trust the west coast management, and put resources here. We won't disappoint you. Other than that, keep doing what you're doing -- what we see from out here seems way healthier than right after the acquisition.

The Avis culture is straight out of 1983 and is filled with entitled, chauvinistic leaders who engorge themselves at their employees’ expense. Here’s how not to run a company:

- lie to your employees about what will and won’t happen post-acquisition
- immediately come up with amazing “profit generators” which the field knows will be both incredible failures and cost the company more than they’re worth
- start freezing hiring in July (or earlier) each year, and refuse to pay internal promotions market rates while giving external hires the same amount
- promote people that have no business leading a market or division who flaunt their money and revel in degrading employees
- take no action about sexual harassment complaints, even when addressed to senior Avis leadership
- drive off talent who thinks for themselves and can create/develop strategy; centralize all decisions while being wrong or slow most of the time
- fail to invest in technology as the competition leaves it behind
- produce an “upgrade” to the app that is widely panned","Zipcar was once an incredible company led by smart, talented people.

Working at the company (I was at HQ) is relatively fun, given a pretty laid-back environment and a lot of energetic people.

There is a major disconnect between Home Office's expectations and the capacity of the local markets. Very little support from them as well.

Metrics for bonuses are not tailored for individual markets, often making them unattainable (which I expect was the point).

The compensation is low compared to competitors.

The hand-off of certain departments from Zipcar employees to Avis employees (AP and Accidents, for example) was a complete mess and left both the local markets and our customers without answers or resolutions for weeks.

I was expected to go retrieve stolen cars. Enough said on that.

Every year the whole company participated in an internal survey rating Zipcar on multiple key factors (pay, benefits, overall happiness, etc) and every year the score would come back lower than Home Office expected. There would be a company wide WebEx to discuss this and take feedback, but no changes were ever made. This is the key reason I left. They constantly ask for new ideas and bill themselves as a fun, fresh, tech company but end up simply wasting everyone's time when the feedback they ask for isn't taken to heart.","Actually live your core values. They're why I chose to work at Zipcar in the first place. Pay attention to the reasons that so many of your employees have left in the last few years. Adapt. Please, adapt.

The company is laying off people in mass quantities, including most of marketing/sales and instead replacing them with Avis employees. The culture is almost non-existent anymore. Pay is severely low. People are miserable and leaving constantly. There is no leadership or vision. The Home Office treats the field offices like dirt.

It is a highly dysfunctional sinking ship.

The Zipcar New York office was a corrupt, abusive and damaging workplace while I was there. The problems started at the top with incompetent and corrupt management and trickled down.

The major issues in the NYC office were the unethical hiring practices ie. nepotism, sexual harassment and general neglect for it’s employees. The lack of critical thought and strategic planning was alarming.

Nepotism:
Upper management in the NYC office spent the last 3-4 years stacking the rest of the management team with their highly unqualified friends from the gym and hotel industries. Managers so incompetent it was laughable, so openly informal and friendly with upper management that it was inappropriate. Multiple managers who were in charge of running whole departments did not possess basic computer, analytical and critical thinking skills but because they were friends with management they were protected from any consequences.

A Culture of Fear:
Instead of investing in employee development, employees were set up to fail and pushed out or fired. There was a culture of fear established instead of support. Managers micromanaged because they didn't understand the product or how systems worked. Never have I worked in a place where intelligence, logic, respect and professionalism were so disregarded. Not only did these conditions affect the work environment and employee moral, it affected business. Poor business decisions were made by incompetent leadership affecting the bottom line.

Sexual Harassment:
Local management and Zipcar HR ignored sexual harassment claims in the NYC office for years. Women in the office were often verbally harassed regarding their appearance, touched inappropriately, or subjected to sexist and inappropriate language and comments. This was something that became normalized and not taken seriously. Zipcar HR’s response to the sexual harassment claims was irresponsibly passive.

I have never seen an office of people so unanimously and collectively unhappy, miserable and stuck even while working to support and innovate a product: car sharing, that we all actually truly believed in and cared about.",The entire company and the NYC office in particular need a complete overhaul in management to get rid of the toxic leadership that currently exists.,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,

Zipcar needs more senior engineers. Currently senior engineers get ""promoted"" to Tech Lead, which means they're in meetings all day or putting out some fire. Whatever free time they get, they're fielding questions from their team rather than coding.

Work environment is very reactive vs. proactive.

Insane amount of technical debt with no leadership, guidance, allocated resources, or incentive to work on it.

Ask to see a diagram of the internal architecture. Now try to find someone who can explain what every piece does.

People aren't held accountable for their actions (or lack thereof).

Some people claim to know more than they actually do.

Unless you have an established relationship with someone, getting buy-in from people outside your team to do work for you is difficult.

Engineering QOL is pretty poor unless you're working on a newer project. Even then, it's only a matter of time before you face an issue caused by legacy.

You have to forge your own career path. You can't expect to get any guidance or mentoring from anyone.

Pay is on the low side of median. Raises are meager, unless you're getting a title change.

Everyone has a vested interest in providing great service, and we are committed to our members.

There's no, ""put in another 2 years and you'll get the promotion"" culture; those instances are few and far between, and are mostly based on perception, rather than reality. And because advancement isn't limited, people are able to help each other and collaborate without feeling threatened.

We were once the only game in town, literally creating the North American car sharing market.

Though listed as a con, competition is also a positive. Now, more than ever, Zipcar will be forced to innovate and evolve.

Some of the things that carried over from Flexcar to Zipcar werer the laid-back atmosphere, enthusiasm for the concept of car-sharing, and the feeling we were in on the ground floor of a whole new transportation business.","With Flexcar, we had an innovative, somewhat clunky system for making reservations and driving the cars; Zipcar merged the their system with ours and made it even clunkier. Even worse, as innovations in carsharing continued to develop (like car2go's point-to-point system) Zipcar clung to its increasingly outdated system. I can only imagine how badly the Zipcar system wil age after the Avis merger.

There's really no chance for advancement. I checked my old supervisor's LinkedIn profile, and he still has the same job title. Maybe he's content with that.

The marketing department changed its focus from recruiting new members who would actually use the service, to merely luring folks into the tent with carny tricks -- like spinning prize wheels or throwing beanbags for driving credit -- in order to push the recruitment numbers up.

Zipcar's business plan was: take the idea of Flexcar; get bigger faster, dominate the East coast. When they acquired the West-coast-based Flexcar territories, they had no interest in learning anything from the company they were taking over, because as far as they were concerned, they had obviously won the game.

It cheaps out by paying good engineers less than market value and makes up for lack of appropriate staffing with a really strong internship program with Northeastern.

2014-08-07, Brand Ambassador,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Keep Looking Brand Ambassadors,,0,It's a very laid back environment. Everyone wants to have a good time. Upper tier managers are great and really know how to use their resources. They care about the personality of the company. Extremely flexible with people's time. Many compliments to upper management. Good pay for having no experience.,"Standards are unclear. Some people are a lot lazier than others. Some employees kick themselves to be shining. Even then it's okay at best. The pay is nice and easy work but there is absolutely no reward and the managers need to learn how to manage. Communication is not good at all because the structure is very messed up internally and the person leading the BAs do not plan ahead to make their time worthwhile. A lot of them have a foot up their butt however because they lack integrity and strong team building skills to actually function really efficiently. You meet a lot of good characters there but then there are more people that you just wonder what they do all day because even out at events, it's like they just sit around.

Being a BA, there are not enough of us and they can call us on any shift whenever they want if your availability is well, available. This means that if you put available on your schedule, you are pretty much on call. This is a pain in the butt and no body communicates where to meet or what needs to be picked up or even how to get in the office before an event starts (definitely not the manager of the BAs) While they say they are flexible with scheduling as long as you can get your shift covered (which is really great and all) but there is never anyone to cover your shift because there are not enough of us out there. They also don't plan well with resource planning. The scheduling part really sucks unless if you want to forfeit any life you would like to have during the weekends (when I started I thought that was okay, now I think its cruel that you can devote 25 hours in one weekend to stand around and talk to drunk festival people)

Work is not distributed evenly and it is hard to know when you are doing things right or wrong. Also training is pretty much non existent. You learn on the job and if you don't learn you might just guess all the time or ask another BA but that makes you feel like you can't do much and you have to just keep relying on each other. A lot of BAs really screw up accounts anyways. They give away a ton of free driving credit which is always fun but then when it comes to applications they forget what has to be completed or told to the new member because they were never really trained. It really messes with the backend of the work for the team leaders.

Also pay is low compared to other BA jobs. Discount is amazing which kind of makes up for it.",Manage your time and your people if you want to be respected. Thank you for being so accommodating to everyone's personal life. Flexibility in the job was good.,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0

2014-06-11,,"Boston, MA",Current Employee ,"The Best Of A Non-Corporate Culture Is Gone, Avis Takes Over",,0,"The best thing about working here now is being backed up by big brother ABG (Avis Budget Group). With deep pockets and international presence ABG brings a tremendous punch to rapidly accelerate Zipcar's Growth. Corporate career minded individuals can do well here and if working for ABG or a major corporation is a goal, then this is a good place to start. A fair number of people in their 20's - 30's still give the company a young vibe and at least a small expectation of operating as a ""start up"" (beer cart Fridays, ping pong table, on site showers). Financially Zipcar remains and will most likely continue to be a strong company, and doubly strong with ABG. Newer roles are being developed and old ones are being filled as employees continue to leave at a fast pace. One can make their mark here now while turnover continues.","Massive changes since the ABG takeover have deeply impacted the core culture and competencies of Zipcar as a brand. Shifting focus away from being very particular about the brand, despite their constant verbalizing it, we no longer 'obsess about the member experience'. The primacy of Synergy is what counts now and extracting efficiencies out of sharing resources takes precedence over providing Zipcar members with the vehicles and experience they've come to expect. While still paying in the lower range, especially for engineers, the great advantage of a casual and relaxed business atmosphere is evaporating as stiff management takes over. Benefits and communication are now filtered through a behemoth organization with more internal web sites, separate log ins and passwords than one can keep track of.","Step back and listen to employees and members as to what they truly want without regard to ""Synergy"".

Empowerment: If you can think of it, there's a good chance you'll be allowed to do it/try it.
Passion: LOTS of people strongly believe in the brand and it's mission. People come here to love their jobs.
Teamwork: People like and want to help each other.
Brand: People tend to light up when you say you work for Zipcar. It makes everything easier.
Meritocracy: A significant amount of internal promotion has taken place over the last year. Keep moving up the people who can truly make a difference.","The car-sharing world has gotten a lot more competitive in the last two years. The company should invest a lot more resources into its technology to create things its members didn't know they wanted until they had it.

With the acquisition by Avis Budget, there has been a natural slowdown in decision-making due to increased bureaucracy, but this is getting better. Keep trusting Zipcar's leaders to do what they know is best and keep it's culture intact. Remember, we're not car rental - that's a commodity business with no differentiation other than price. Lose that 'special sauce' and all that talent will start to bleed away.

Opportunities:
Technology investment - Google just bought Titan Aerospace to stay 5 years ahead. Think the same way.
Corporate ownership - You don't know everything about car sharing. Trust the people who do know a lot and add your experience in support systems that make peoples' jobs easier.
Localization - every department and market is different. Keep the Borg mentality out of the company.

There is an overall energy that is positive and people care about their jobs; you can see evidence of hard work in every corner of the office.

Many managers are happy to delegate projects out to entry level employees, which allows you to improve your skills and earn some stripes for your resume. Although you may not receive financial compensation for the extra work, you will find yourself continually challenged and trusted with new responsibilities.

The culture of zipcar is fun. The office is laid back and casual and there are often small events that allow employees to socialize such as a chili cook off or a guacamole off for Cinco de Mayo. Zipcar has found a great balance between keeping things fun and keeping things professional, something that many young companies strive for (and often fall short of).","After 11 years in business and a successful IPO, zipcar needs to stop telling its employees that it's still a small startup. The pay is mediocre at best, raises are few and far between, and the benefits package doesn't make up for it. Ideally, it would be nice to see some sort of stock option, 401(k) matching plan, or cheaper benefits for employees.

Within the member services department, there is little room for growth. Unlike other departments, there are fewer ""levels"" of employment so you have three options: 1) make a lateral move to another department and work your way up, 2) wait for your manager to quit and apply for his/her job or 3) seek opportunities elsewhere.

2017-06-03,,,Former Employee ,Look elsewhere.,,0,- With the current state of the organization = none.,"The company and its management absolutely have no idea how to run a business and manage people. Constantly making promises and assurances that get broken within weeks.

- Management in place (from local markets to Home Office) are absolutely incompetent, making business decisions to keep face and with a personal agenda vs decisions that are best for the business and its profitability.

- Management will play favorites and promote / keep individuals within the organization with whom they are friends. Resulting in a number of people within the organization with titles that do not makes sense and have no real responsibility.

- Retaliation on a massive scale within the organization should you even think about questioning or voicing out a concern on a business practise or a decision.

- Organization lives with the motto of ""do more with less today, and even more with less tomorrow"". Eliminating positions and passing off workload to remaining individuals with the expectation to have it done while having a mandate of no over-time paid across the board

Zipcar once was a great brand which inspired great talent and made great decisions. Unfortunately when the management changed, it has now become on organizations which is plagued by horrible decisions, reckless spending, blatant violations of labor laws, and an environment which is overall negative and full of individuals constantly on edge & filled with anxiety.
