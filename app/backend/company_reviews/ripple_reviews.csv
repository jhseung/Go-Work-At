The culture is probably the most important part about the company - all Ripplers believe in the same 5 core values embodied in LEGGO: ""Live it, Enjoy it, Get it done, Go for it, Own it"".

When I joined Ripple, the people team introduced me to the right people at the company and sent me a surprise gift of champagne and some swag in my first week, definitely making me feel special and appreciated.

Part of the fun of being a blockchain company is the rapidly evolving market landscape, and being held responsible for your own success (or failure) as a company. The risk/reward profile is highly favorable, as Ripple is leading the way (hint: look up ""network effects""). And yes, you can elect to get paid in XRP.

There are also snacks in our office micro-kitchens and opportunities to travel around the world to our offices in New York, London, Sydney, India, Singapore and Luxembourg. There are people who are leaders in their field doing the work of their lives sitting right next to you, and it is incredibly rewarding work! Furthermore, Ripple is a company that is constantly in the media, and we are always proud to see positive news (fortunately, there is quite a lot). Internally, the leadership team is incredibly transparent and holds a weekly Q&A for any employees to ask questions.

2017-04-18,,,Current Employee ,Very special company in a very special industry. Incredible momentum and great people,,0,"Like another reviewer, I've been at some other top Silicon Valley companies and totally wowed by the talent and passion and Ripple. People are some of the smartest and most respected on the planet, particularly on the Eng side.

I'm working on some of the most interesting challenges of my career in one of the hottest areas in tech right now and many of my peers say the same. The market opportunity is huge and Ripple seems to be ahead of any competitor so it's also great to be at a place that is winning.

The culture is one of the most collaborative I've been at and very inclusive. As a female early in my career, I find it inspiring to see so many women in leadership positions. While some things still need to be figured out, I feel like the various leaders spend a lot of time updating everyone at the company meetings so I know what's going on.

Unlike a lot of early stage startups, the senior leadership team is incredibly experienced. That experience and level of professionalism has reduced the pain points, lack of direction and general frustrations that I've experienced at other startups with young leaders who are learning how to lead or manage for the very first time.

I've also enjoyed the various company and team outings and I've made a lot of good friends here!

As other people have said, Ripple is a great place to be if you want to be the best at your game and work with world-class talent. Managers are very understanding about time off and personal commitments, but people are also super motivated about Ripple's mission and want to continue the amazing momentum so expectations are high to deliver great work product. Generally people who aren't motivated to win and can't adapt to the pace and expectations around high quality work product don't last too long.","Definitely some growing pains like any startup. Some teams are more execution oriented than others and the rest of the company can feel it when someone isn't pulling their weight.

Some teams need people with more experience in their specific role. Feels like the company is growing so quickly that it is outgrowing the skill set of some of the earlier or more junior hires.

It's super fast paced and the expectations are high. It''s motivating for me and I'm still able to maintain a decent work-life balance but it may not be a fit for everyone.","Continue to hire - we need more people!

We are at the point where we need more processes as the company grows in more locations. We are scaling too quickly to not have streamlined communication or somewhere to reference on who to contact for various things or to get approvals or decisions made.

Continue to focus. The market opportunity is so big and there are so many things we can pursue that I think we need to stay focused or there is risk of burn out.

There are some extremely smart and talented people, especially on the engineering team.","Serious growing pains. Used to be a fun place to work with happy hours, culture committee events, and occasional outings. After hiring a COO from the corporate world, Ripple decided the only path forward is hard-work and cut nearly all investment in employee happiness. So no more happy hours or clubs. You'll typically find people in the office well past 7pm pretending to work. No company lunch, so you probably won't ever get to know your fellow employees outside of work mode. Unsurprisingly, this leads to a lot of conflict between teams.

And don't expect your voice to be heard - senior management is basically a bunch of early 30s, first time managers who don't understand how to lead teams and therefore put an axe on all feedback. The C-levels insist that they're too important to talk to directly, even though Ripple is only 120 employees. Corporate culture.","Rethink Ripple's core values to decide what's important.

Then you start asking how it works and you think ""wow, that's REALLY crazy"" -- it's a distributed network that's open source and open for anyone to join and use. Then, you ask about how the company makes money if it's all open source and you find that it's a startup that actually makes money.

Ripple Labs has an unbelievably talented and intelligent team. I have met some of the smartest people I know here, but they are also the type to take the time to explain (in whatever level of technical details you want) exactly what they're working on, what it does, and how it works. I am truly inspired by the people I work with.

People work hard here because they believe the company and the technology have great potential and they are passionate about and challenged by what they do. At the same time, it's not the kind of place where you're expected to work crazy hours -- the CEO has a family and kids and so he's going to go home at a reasonable time and that kind of attitude definitely trickles down from him. There are some people who are out by 6pm most days and others who work consistently over the weekends because this is what they love doing. There's a great balance and overall it's a fantastic place to work.

Lastly, there were about 5 days in the past year when I was not excited to go to work, and those were largely because I didn't get enough sleep the night before. It's really an inspiring team and I've had an opportunity to work on some fascinating and challenging projects.","This is a startup that's growing fast. The team has grown by 4 or 5 times in the past year and we're constantly hiring more. As such, we haven't gotten all the processes right yet and it's important that new employees seek out the help, explanations, or guidance they need. Individual teams are still quite small but it's definitely getting to the point where not everyone knows one another.","Really my only gripe is that over the past couple of months we've gone from emphasizing how flat the organization is to hearing constant mentions of the Leadership Team's strategy offsite meetings. As the company grows it obviously becomes impossible for everyone to participate in strategy conversations. However, I think the leadership and strategy of the company could be more open and inclusive if we thought about it first as a collaborative process that not everyone has the time or bandwidth to participate in (though they could if they wanted to), and less as the domain of the ""Leadership Team"" whose findings then get shared with the rest of the company.",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
