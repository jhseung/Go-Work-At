The company is based in the Northwest, and has had growth year over year, since its inception. There is an open door management style; bring your issues to management; ask for your growth opportunities; and ask for the rewards you expect for a job well done. There is tremendous opportunity here for hard working people who are passionate about excellence.","The company has growing pains - processes do not necessarily translate to function, and performance expectations have created a CYA mentality when expectations are not met. Company moral has taken some hits, and some key players have moved on. Be part of the solution and stick it out.","Keep eyes open to staff moral, declines in excellence, declines in enthusiasm. Good people have left, and continue to migrate - growing pains and growth expectations do not need to drive good people away.

2015-11-01, Virtual Engineer,"Spokane, WA",Current Employee ,Great Place to Grow,Great Place to Grow,0,"Cerium has been my starting point in my technical career and they have been excellent to work for. I came in with just a passion and a weekend hobby and the IT director and staff took a chance on me and brought me onboard to learn from the senior level engineering team. This experience has been invaluable. There are so many great people here who are willing to share their knowledge and experience that really makes the whole team better. Opportunities for promotion are always available. Personally, I have been to Montana, and when it wasn’t working out, the management team and ownership worked with me and my family to put everyone in the best position for success. They brought me back to Spokane, and found another great team for me to be a part of. The ownership also gives employees the freedom to pursue their passions, which are usually technology based, which gives the employee ownership of that knowledge. I needed a company who was willing to take a chance on me, who didn’t have much to bring to the table except a work ethic and drive and they did. I couldn’t think of a better place to grow.","There are long hours, especially during a cut, but that is the nature of the business. Some of the communication flows from department to department can be improved upon. The non-compete can be intimidating, but not unmanageable. I would put myself under this category as well as I have lots of room to improve and make myself better, thus making the company better.",Keep moving forward with the company goals and share them with all the employees.

Cerium used to be about caring for customers, now ownership and management spends time time threatening employees thinking about leaving. After a few key members of staff resigned recently for better opportunities for their family - Rather than thanking them for their service. Ownership and Management sent out an email company wide threatening to sue and enforce anti-competes for even non-sales employees whom may be or are considering leaving.before they have even done anything. I wish I could attach it. I am now scared and afraid to leave for my family and I can no longer focus on customers either, I am an engineer and I signed their anti-compete but I have a right to work - I feel trapped and my only recourse is to stay or get legal protection to leave - I feel sickened for my family, I don't know what this place has become and my work is suffering as it's all I think about, hard working people that we cared about and were part of our family left and now we are trying to sue and threaten them - Willing to listen to any legal advice please post your contact information upon post. I need help.",Focus on Customers and your employees more than people leaving - what are we doing? who is more important? This has become sickening - these were good people that put in many hours and helped our company - people will always leave it happens - get over it - we were a proud and competitive company I guess were now just scared - I don't know what this has become but no longer can listen to praise as if I leave you would just sue me to.,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0
