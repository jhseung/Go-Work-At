-Expanded parking lot","Working at Lear is much akin to working in a restaurant, except all the dishes are already burnt and only minutes away from bursting into flames. In a properly managed kitchen, everything should be mise en place. But at Lear, the oven is always a little too hot, the timers are always a little too slow, and all of us are debating whether or not a tomato is a vegetable or a fruit. Strangely, the primary function of any employee at Lear is not to cook. No, their duties are relegated to that of an involuntary firefighter. And the people who know how to extinguish flames will get more recognition than the people with superior cooking skills, which demonstrates how Lear rewards reactivity over productivity. At any time, one of the dishes could spontaneously combust and burn down the entire restaurant, but we just pray with our lives that we get to serve that dish before it detonates. And if the dish we serve ends up being an inedible, ersatz mess, just barely resembling a cauterized char, so be it. At least the restaurant is still intact, right?

The funny thing is that the Lear chefs have a cookbook, and if they followed that cookbook, the restaurant wouldn’t need to be in a constant state of disarray. Indeed, someone else has already perfected the recipes for every dish Lear desires. But somehow, Lear still struggles to make even the most basic foods. And that is because every time directions are laid out in plain English (since Lear doesn’t like to deal with any foreign languages outside of “Learisms”) nobody follows them. Instead of abiding, the chefs at Lear will haughtily insist on reverse-engineering the dishes. Just, why? Literally, we could be making spaghetti with the instructions printed on the box, and instead of obeying what’s written, we’d scope out the competition to test whether or not we can recreate a hackneyed version of their pasta. It’s a bizarre fixation on trying to plagiarize, instead of adhering to the rubric.

You know how foreign restaurants will often have menus in different languages if they have international patrons? For instance, the Japanese restaurant down the street from Lear offers an English version of its menu, even though the restaurant's owner is Japanese. Well, at Lear, even though it does business with customers in 39 countries, the menu is, and has only ever been, offered in English. Yes, the ideals of American exceptionalism run adamantly deep at this establishment. So if you don’t speak English, you can’t dine here. And when restaurant critics bring up that all the other establishments cater to speakers of other languages, Lear says it’s too difficult to implement such a change. Sure, even though everyone else has no problems with offering a menu in Spanish and Chinese at a minimum, somehow the feat is just too cumbersome at Lear. Well, it’s only had a hundred years to find a solution, so the answer hasn’t been reverse-engineered yet...

Speaking of restaurant critics, these are a group that Lear cares intensely about, because they control its funding. For many years, Lear has tried its hand at being some type of two-in-one restaurant, selling both comfort-food burgers and trendy sashimi. At some places, this mixed menu may work, but the critics of Lear have never understood the setup. Does Lear sell American food or Japanese food? Why can’t it make up its mind? Well, not wanting to give up one or the other, the company started a campaign to market itself as a “fusion” restaurant, but the phrase never did catch on. One would think that if the reviews of these critics truly mattered that Lear would do what they were demanding: separate into a sushi bar and a burger joint. But, no, even though the mandate was quite clear, the company decided that it could still sell the fusion idea by holding a special reception banquet. The banquet was a splendid and exorbitant display. And even though the critics never expressed an interest in such an event, the hope was that this lavish spectacle would be enough to stupefy them. In the end, the critics seemed placated; but the very next day, the reviews came in and they were still dismal. Hindsight is 20/20, but I was not the only one who expressed doubt that the banquet was a bad strategy to begin with. What is the opposite of a good idea with poor execution? A terrible plan with perfect implementation — which some may rightly say is the worser of the two. Congregating all the critics into one space, only to tell them that their primary suggestions weren’t being adopted? There’s not enough razzle-dazzle in the world to prevent someone from seeing right through that. The real shame is that those hundreds of thousands of dollars and man-hours spent for that sole ordeal couldn’t have been used in a more productive manner, such as upgrading the kitchen equipment for the staff. Even constructing that much requested walking path would’ve been a better use of the money. At least that could lend some tangible health benefits.

The threat of a fire is always omnipresent. But how does a company reach such a point that the busser who points to the obvious has his apprehensions so easily dismissed? Culture, unsurprisingly. You see, at Lear there is a pervasive culture of taking things to a higher level. “High level” is a colloquialism at Lear, a Learism, which has an erroneous meaning not found in any standard dictionary. At Lear, the phrase translates to “big picture” and perhaps is etymologically related to the idea of an executive summary, aka high-level summary. This phrase is so ubiquitous that it's even thrown around during interviews. (E.g. “Are you more detail-oriented or high-level?”) I think the thought process is that by saying “high level” that any granular item can be dangerously ignored as a peripheral, frivolous footnote. After all, what is higher level than making sure we have RIPE tomatoes? That we have tomatoes at all. And what is higher level than having tomatoes at all? That we have tomato sauce. What is higher level than tomato sauce? That we have pasta. What’s higher level than that? That we have food. What’s higher than that? That we have money. Everything is downplayed to focus on the supposed larger issue at hand. Obviously, this fallacious logic can repeat ad nauseam until one reaches “finding the meaning of the universe.” Or maybe even higher level than that would be discovering the purpose of existence itself. Suffice it to say, zooming out to an ever-growing larger picture is neither a talent, nor a difficult skill to acquire. By restating an issue as broader, more generic, and more nebulous, it just leads to there being no solution at all. If the entirety of the world’s top philosophers haven’t been to answer mankind’s “highest level” problems over the past several millennia, I doubt that a thirty-minute meeting between Lear employees disguised as a “high-level” brainstorming session is going to accomplish much, if anything. As an aside, if “high level” infers that the Golden Gate Bridge were simply created as a structure to connect the San Francisco Bay to the Pacific Ocean, then I would probably never feel safe driving my car over it. That is how I feel about anyone who uses “high level” as a scapegoat for enabling mediocrity. It’s a vapid tool used to end conversations and dismiss concerns, instead of encouraging discussions. I would be empathetic of this obsession with the big picture, if Lear employees were known for being inordinately detail-oriented and meticulous, but that really isn't a part of the Lear culture, so this broad-view fixation tends to be more harmful than helpful.

Ultimately, if I were to distill the major issues at Lear, they would be myopia, disorganization, minimization, and attention deficiency. And that’s not even touching upon the microagressions of white supremacy that appear to exist in at least one department, which could probably substantiate the existence of white exclusionary feminism as a real phenomenon. Seriously, if you just did the math on the amount of blue-eyed individuals, considering the population makeup of the US, it is disgustingly skewed in favor of a certain phenotype. That is to say, I strongly believe that some people are blind to their own prejudices. Of course, a lack of diversity is to be expected at any place that incubates nepotism, but that's a whole other topic.

On the rare occasion you voice a concern and it’s not dismissed as inconsequential, it will be heard — albeit limitedly. That is, until someone smells smoke in the air, and everyone’s attention shifts to the next burning topic du jour. Initiatives at Lear are as transient as waves crashing along a beach, extending only to a certain line before receding from the shore. None of the problems Lear has faced, and will face, are anything new; they’re all just mindless, unsurprising reiterations of obstacles that weren’t properly stymied in the first place. It’s an endless, reactionary cycle of playing catch-up, and management is never ahead of the curve. But the only real losers in this game are the employees, the replaceables, the apparent dispensables.","Someone can start by addressing the terrible practices of HR at Lear. Sensitive information is often just emailed to one another, often using personal accounts. Can you imagine? ""Yes, I'll just send you my social security information from my Gmail. No, I have no qualms whatsoever that either you or I could get hacked.""

After all this time, I have never had my suspicions assuaged that Lear's HR even remotely knows what it's doing. One would think, nay expect, that a centennial-aged company with a workforce exceeding 160,000 would know how to manage its employees by this time. So much of what it's lacking should really just be standard practice. But you can take my word for it; if you have a question, HR probably doesn't have a satisfactory answer.

Examples of common questions to HR:

Q: Where do I submit my volunteer hours?
A: Um, we don’t keep track of those.

Q: How can I get involved with an employee resource group?
A: What's that?

Q: When do I go through employee onboarding?
A: Oh, you’ll just casually pick it up along the way.

Q: What’s your fax number?
A: Fax? We don’t have a fax machine. Who uses those anymore?

HR is supposed to be the place you go to when you have problems in the workplace. It’s the opposite at Lear, where HR is probably the cause of half your issues to begin with. It’s not that Lear doesn’t know how to improve its culture, or that it’s unaware of its own problems. In fact, I’ve been there for many of the discussions surrounding these possible improvements. But at the end of those meetings, nothing actually happens. We find out some “revelatory” insight, we compare and contrast our company’s performance, we get told from experts what our best practices should be, and then… we repeat the same process all over again. It’s frustrating how many duplicate versions of workforce enhancement strategies I’ve had to witness. The “high level” part has already been surmised, rephrased, disassembled, and reassembled dozens of times. How many more times do you need to hear about maternity leave options, shareholder rights, women in the workplace, and millennial retention? Now is the part for tangible implementations to be made.

Anyone can come up with a grandiose dream for what they want to accomplish in their future. Companies are the same. The difference between those who attain their goals versus those who spew out bluff and bluster is not a lack of vision, it is that one person knew how to break their long-term goal into manageable steps, while another person didn't even know how to begin. If Lear would just invest its energy into at least attempting to make strides towards improvement, rather than constantly regurgitating the ""strategy"" and wasting its effort on the bravado portion, we'd at least have gone somewhere and with some kind of deliverable. Instead, we're loitering at point A, arguing about the destination, when someone could start by filling up the tank. It’s a great skill to not lose sight of the big picture, but not if maintaining such an abstract mindset inhibits you from making SMART goals and acting on them. Otherwise, your dreams are just delusions. I think the following platitude is appropriate for this scenario: ""Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.""
