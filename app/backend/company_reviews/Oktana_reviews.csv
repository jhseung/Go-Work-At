2019-01-03,,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Do not work here.,Do not work here.,0,Talented developers and UI/UX designers.,"1. No workflow at all

2. No room for new ideas

3. No transparency on anything

4. Not tolerant of opposing views

5. No onboarding process - I had to use my colleague's cellphone hotspot to connect to Gmail for the first time

6. No budget for anything company related, including company toiletries or office snacks

7. No real office, we use a shared-office space for mail but work out of an apartment

8. Terrible benefits, if you can even consider it a benefits plan...

9. Expected to use my personal phone to make business calls

10. Both owners micromanage every aspect of the company and do not trust anyone else to make any decisions

11. Owners are constantly measuring the worth of each employee to see where they can cut back

12. At the end of the day, the owners are brothers, if either one makes a mistake, the blame will be placed on whoever was conveniently involved. Accountability is not a value here.

14. The turnover rate is through the roof",Stop wasting everyone's time. Learn to take responsibility for your own actions and stopped blaming other people for your mistakes. If you cannot take constructive criticism you will never make it. Also please stop telling people this is a NY based company when it is actually based in Uruguay. It's misleading.,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
2018-12-21, Account Manager,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Account Manager,Account Manager,0,"Good pay
The people who don’t run the company are great.","This company can never be successful under the current owners. Wildly mismanaged. There is zero infrastructure, and no job security. It’s complete chaos. There is no strategy or any procedures in place. They refuse to take constructive criticism. I was forced to send out work that I was embarrassed to have my name tied to it. The head of the company micromanages every aspect of your job while simultaneously not knowing what to do. They actively prevent you from succeeding. I wish I read the reviews before accepting my position because all of the negative reviews accurately depict exactly how awful it is there. I genuinely can’t imagine any of the positive reviews to be actual employees, and not just the two men who are failing to run the company. The boss will tell you to do something, and then yell at you for doing it. His main strategy is gaslighting his employees, and avoiding any ownership of the deep seeded problems within the company. They have no consideration for people’s time, nor do they have any respect. Highly incompetent leaders with big egos. Truly an embarrassing organization.","You guys were incapable of succeeding in your first company Timba Software. You will be incapable of succeeding with Oktana. Maybe look into an entirely didn’t path, because this will never work out for you guys.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

- Contractor contracts to avoid paying taxes and offering a bit higher pay (because they dont pay taxes on it, they still make a higher margin than what they offer)
- No real career path or growth.
- Growth means taking more projects without a real benefit , just extra workload for a few more bucks.
- Owner is very hands on and very controlling, has left many workers crying due to pressure and veiled threats.
