Friendships","Where do I begin? Well first off I’ve been with the company for 11 months! At first I thought this job was going to be my dream job, but it was not what I expected!

Pay:

As a stylist your hourly rate starts at $15.50/hour with NO commission! Definitely not worth the amount of stress this job gives! Reasons why they throw parties and buy snacks to compensate the lack of pay!

Flawed Quota System:

You are required to hit a monthly quota in order to hit your bonus if you don’t have a quota you simply do not get your bonus What is equivalent to making a few days of overtime.. If you make a quota as a team then your manager will get a bonus check! This is why some may feel their managers “act like they care about their them” due to micromanaging & unprofessionalism!

 In order survive in this company you have to maintain at least 90% or above towards a quota in order to maintain and keep your work from home days. Some of these quota numbers are so unrealistic and didn’t make sense due to seasonality of purchasing! Even the sales managers admitted that the numbers were too high & that they failed last year so basically they were setting us up for failure from the beginning.

Unprofessionalism among some Managers:

As mentioned, Sales Manager’s receive a bonus check whenever their team hits their quota so with that some managers micromanaged their teams. Some of them would gossip between other managers about their failing team players. It was just overall unprofessional & upper management didn’t really care! I’ve had many colleagues during my time that would go to upper management and HR but nothing was resolved. It’s very sad!

Turnover Rate:

Extremely High, at least 2-3 people quit every week!","My advice to the management is to really listen to your employees when they come to you with an issue it just seems like the manager is the only one that’s being protected & the Stylists were never heard. If someone is uncomfortable or struggling on a team give them the opportunity to swap another team! It’s so simple!

Lastly, listen to these negative remarks that you see about your company. They are not coming out of no where! This company tells you to “Adapt to change” well how about changing for the better for future employees!",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

-Work from home but only if you hit your quota, can be taken away at any time
-“Unlimited"" PTO, only under managers discretion","-This was by far the most horrifying work experience I have ever had, as other reviews have state: very unprofessional atmosphere, managers are dishonest and only criticize your work, directors will blatantly talk to managers about how they do not like individual stylists here due to them not hitting unachievable quotas.
-If you are not meeting your monthly sales goals, which are absolutely absurd, you will be pushed out by upper management and bullied until you’re forced to quit.
-Performance based scheduling, you will work 11-8pm with no weekends off even if you hit quota every month
-Clear favoritism of top sellers, managers will only invest and praise top performers and push out others rather than helping to train or guide them
-We’re open all holidays, even Christmas. You have to bid into whether you work or not, which you will most likely not get off
-No commission on sales for national team
-The turn over rate is insane, people quit every week even with no job lined up because they can’t stand working here
-HR will openly tell managers what you say to them in confidential conversations, once they find out that you went to HR you will be pushed out

I was one of the unlucky ones working under a manager who was extremely unprofessional and a bully behind closed doors. I spent five months working my hardest to earn my manager’s respect thinking it was my fault. When I finally talked to others on my team everyone was so shocked and said things like “Really? I thought I was the only one getting bullied.” When I discovered all of the facts and pursued the issue, the higher ups failed to correct the behavior. An entire team is getting mistreated every single day and most cannot do anything about it because they relocated for this job or need the money.

Aside from this personal experience, employees are paid a small hourly wage with an overload of work that is not possible to complete during their shift.

Rooftop access","The only people who can afford to work there, let alone withstand the 3 month training period in which you do not even make a livable wage, are people who have outside or parental financial support, which incredibly limits the application pool. It can be isolating to work there if you don't come from money.

There is an incredibly insecure management style. There's obsessive micromanagement, and whichever executive(s) is making them all this crazed and paranoid failed to realize this attitude creates an environment where we can all feel the anxiety and paranoia, and it's draining. If the numbers are as good as you'd have us believe, there'd be little reason for management to be so flustered.

We have meeting after meeting and ""training"" after ""training"" in which we rehash information everyone already knows, or gather the entire team together only to parade the top sellers in front of us and give them prizes. This takes us away from doing actual work.

I've also reached out to more than one HR rep several times and they just don't respond.

The office is also poorly kept and that's a downer too. It's messy and cluttered, catered food and supplies stick around for a week or more, and things are consistently missing or never replenished - there doesn't seem to be an office manager. It often does not feel like a professional environment.

Also, there's pretty much no room for growth or advancement.","You guys are in over your heads. Outside consultation is probably best, but at the very least please train your managers in leadership and management style. You CANNOT promote any person who has performed well at their job into a leadership position and expect them to succeed.

2018-09-19, Software Engineer,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Tech team has a solid foundation but there's always room for improvements,Tech team has a solid foundation but there's always room for improvements,0,"- Trunk Club's real strength in their tech team is being great at hiring smart, thoughtful, and accountable people. Regardless of other material cons, this is something most companies can't get right no matter how much money they throw at ping pong tables, free snacks, etc. You really just like working with almost everyone you encounter there.

- Tech leadership is super open to feedback from all levels. They might not being able to act on everything but it's safe to share and they will take it seriously. You just need to obviously not be a jerk about it and want to make positives moves to resolve issues versus just complaining to complain.

- You get a lot of autonomy and freedom to plan out your own work and it's about if they're seeing results and not following some elaborate process. Also teams get autonomy in how they want to work and what works well for that team specifically.

- As an engineer you feel like the leadership and team trust you to make good decisions and to get your work done. You get hands on with stakeholders, data science, design, etc.

- No hard deadlines or unreasonable demands from business, good environment of healthy pushback when needed

- Work/life balance is pretty great. Sure there's on call after hours but everyone is super helpful and you never feel alone at least if you're working on an incident. There's no expectation that you take work home with you or that you stay late. Work hours are flexible as well.

- Interesting time at the company right now as the new leadership is acting on new strategies that have really impacted the financials positively. So there's a lot of momentum, excitement, and demand on the tech team to deliver.

- Fantastic apprenticeship program and environment of learning/mentoring.

- Work from home policy is flexible and unlimited PTO is truly unlimited.

- Nordstrom/Trunk Club discount is nice","- It's not a tech company, it's a retail/sales company so much of company communication is not geared towards you. This can be impactful in how I think the business invest in the tech team.

- Comp/Benefits: Comp is above average for juniors, probably in line for mid level and I'm not sure about seniors. I think the benefits (medical, 401k) are below average, I think HR and the leadership know this but it's hard to change. It's not aligned with Nordstrom benefits, so there's no 401k matching or fully paid medical/dental/vision. This can be a real con if you have a family or have needs that would make these things significant cost to you.

- Career Progress: The biggest pain point here is from those mid level engineers trying to get promoted to senior. There's been turnover of people in this particular point in there career.

- Raises: Raises are done annually for everyone at the same time. So if you get a promotion within 6 months of that time then you don't get a raise. Additionally raises are generally just cost of living increases. Real raises are tied to promotions which if you stuck in the position I described above then it can be a bummer.

- Bonuses: No annual bonuses, you can get spot bonuses but my impression is that is at the discretion of your manager and is not to be expected.

- Workload: The team is staffed and worked to capacity. There's really no wiggle room if someone leaves or is out. While the business is understanding of things just not be able to be completed, it still feels crappy to not deliver.

- Office: The office space is just alright. The tech team just rejoined the main office building and there's a lot of room for improvement. This isn't a tech office with free snack, ping pong tables, collaboration spaces, etc. The set up feels more like a sales office packed with desks. They are trying to fill in some of issues as the move is now settling, and leadership know about the issues being raised so that's helpful.","I'd say just really invest in your tech team. Even though it's not a ""tech company"" so much of the business strategy is tied to and demanding of the tech team. You need to make sure you're competitive in finding great talent. You can't just count on having great people/culture as your selling point, it has to be matched with comp/benefits and a great office. All those things show that the company is invested in their tech department and they will feel valued. In the march to profitability don't forget to reinvest in the team.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0

The culture was always supportive and fun and you get a great discount at Nordstrom.,"Starting last year there was a mass exodus of dev staff. Ever since then we were expected to cover the work of all these open roles. We had to work late, pick up more on-calls, and got little to no support from management. I have no problem stepping up when needed but it just wasn't sustainable for a long haul. I have a life outside of work and there's only so much I can give. I also noticed a strong decline in how our team was recognized for our efforts. We had lots of changes in leadership and by the time I left we were either invisible or getting balled out by people. I didn't want to leave but I finally realized I was just hoping things would go back to the way they were before when that wasn't possible. I don't know how you can have this many open roles for this long but it's unacceptable. If you're not getting talent in the door then something needs to change. Change your recruitment strategy. Offer sign on bonuses or 401k matches....you guys are really lagging behind industry standards and it's starting to show.","You're going to keep losing talent if you don't fill the open roles asap. You can't expect people to work night and day without reprieve or reward. Your pay and benefits are below industry standards and if you don't step up soon you're going to find yourselves stranded with a tarnished rep. Also, you need to make sure that management remains respectful even during stressful times. Emotional abuse is completely unacceptable in the workplace.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

2018-06-01,,,Current Employee ,Tailoring Department,Tailoring Department,0,"The people you work daily with are awesome. The environment is somewhat relaxed. There is always pressure of finishing things on time like with any tailor shop but there’s a better balance. It doesn’t run like a sweat shop. There are many tasks that will keep your day going quickly like fittings, QA, sorting, training and sewing. As a lead, you’ll have a great opportunity to help grow people who want to learn and work together.","The upper management is a joke. Tailoring is basically shoved in a corner where people forget about you until they need something. You have to continually remind them about your performance reviews or you’re not going to get one. Raises in this department have been non existent when every other department in the company has already gotten their yearly raises. Management will try and hold you down and not help you to grow in your career because they don’t understand tailoring and why it needs a manager.

The stylists will ask you clean up their mess in a ridiculous amount of time. The lack of respect from some stylists is shocking.",Realize that the tailors are very hard working people and deserve more than what you’re giving them. Career growth is non existent in this department. Stop reorganizing the stylists every week and focus on a team that is going to disappear fast if you don’t pay attention.,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
2018-06-03, Customer Service Associate,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Service Team,Service Team,0,"The service team (customer service dept) is made up of very nice people, including the management. Everyone in this department is professional and I always felt that I was treated fairly by my direct supervisors. The team management will back you up if a customer is abusive or hostile. The department is good about honoring your scheduling requests which makes this a good job for someone in college or with other jobs or obligations.","Although the direct department supervisors are very profession and nice to work with, the company as a whole is trash. Trunk Club very clearly does not value its hourly employees. The pay is very low, although it was raised by about $1 at the beginning of 2018 so it is a few dollars above minimum wage. The benefits are bad and make it clear that this is not really a ""career job"". Also, there a little things that make it clear that this department is not valued, like the fact that they could not close the department a few hours early so we could attend the annual company holiday party.

Although Trunk Club claims they are a fast growing business and appear to be hiring for many positions, there is no ability to transition from the service team to a position or team with any meaningful potential for career growth. In the two years I worked here I think maybe two people got jobs in other departments, and they were still hourly positions. Most people in the department treat it like a temporary job- and there are also quite a few college students or people who have other interests and just need a job on the side. I do think this would be a good job for a student or something like that.

For full time employees, your schedule is never the same week to week. You will have weeks where one week you come in at 7:30am and the next you are scheduled for 1:00pm-10pm. Additionally, you will work weekends. This chaotic scheduling makes planning your life impossible and is extremely stressful.

There is a strange dynamic between this department and the stylists (sales team). Essentially, they have to get our approval in order to do things like create expedited orders or refund customers. This creates an adversarial relationship between our team and the sales team which creates an uncomfortable environment. In some cases, there is open hostility towards other teams or individuals in the company which is obviously unhealthy.

The bottom line is, the job has low pay and no realistic potential for career growth. Avoid it unless you just need a part time or temporary job.","Look at the way this department interacts with the stylists. Why are we in charge of approving things instead of the sales directors?

Include the team in more company wide events or just admit that customer service doesn't matter. You could start by shutting down the department for events like the holiday party or company all hands meetings.",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Micromanagers - Management will constantly micromanage you regardless of your performance - if you're doing great they'll keep pushing you which is good but if you're not doing great they will belittle you and not treat you equally with others - you'll get labeled and essentially put on the shelf.
Unicorn Life - you pretty much have to know brands already (which most employees do since its clothing) but its difficult to know BOTH mens and womans brands like a pro since you don't normally see the clothes in person (all trunk packing is done online through the Nordstrom / TC catalog its a lot of trial and error - which will kill your ever changing 4 week sales goal if you don't keep your product knowledge in order). Good luck! Oh and on top of clothes, don't forget how shoe brands fit - if they run large or small and the thousands of accessories to choose from. So get your go to items for your specific clients needs - and don't forget you have 30 mins to pack the trunk and then it expires. So set a timer! :) You also need to be great at marketing yourself and building your brand within TC and utilizing your network - so if you have wealthy friends you'll do well - if you don't, you'll struggle.
Management will say its a flexible job and you control your paycheck and hours - you can work remote here and there, go to networking events, and such. What they don't say is you can only do that if you hit the insane goals they make for you (and the pay periods are in 2 week sprints but with 4 week sales goals). So if you don't hit 20k per pay period (every 14 days which is 10 work days unless you want to burnout and work weekends - good luck). And those networking events - well get ready to pay for them yourself. Want to host a happy hour with a charcuterie board at a TC location - you pay for all that out of your pocket. Have a fitting at a TC location in another city - 50% of that sale will go towards the clubhouse (ex: the $2k in house sale turns into a $1k sale). The return policy is basically like Nordstrom so get ready for returns anytime and price adjustments.
They give you chromebook - which is the worst computer.
You'll have to outfit your own desk space and its all an open air workspace which is fine but don't expect anything other than a white desk, cords and a desktop computer from the company.

I could go on and on. . . but I'll stop there.

There's also no growth opportunities within the company. You'll pretty much stay a Stylist unless you have insane Stylist sales goal numbers.

There are company core values but that's just for the customer I found it didn't apply towards employees. Trunk Club sounds like the ideal company culture on paper but its not once you get integrated.","Don't micromanage your employees

There's an ""us vs them"" mentality between management and employees, and if you speak up you will be punished. They will tell you ""this is an open environment and we don't want you to suffer in silence"" but if you step on the wrong toe, you're put in probation. Which, by the way, is called a ""Performance Improvement Plan"" but in no way will management actually help you and improve. In fact, this just gives management more ammo to keep their eyes on you and get you in trouble again for anything that might seem like a good reason (such as sitting away from your desk, working on your personal computer from home, or being late to a shift that changed overnight).

But they will use that to get you out the door anyways. Basically, show up to your desk, sit down, work 8 hours, get up, leave, sleep, and do it again. Obey the rules to the tee and you'll get 30k a year.","It feels like you enjoy losing employees because the turnover is so high. Investing in your employee really isn't a thing you do even though you preach it so much. There's so much I wish I could say, but the bottom line is that you don't know what you're doing. I sincerely hope most of you resign and our recruiter hires more qualified management because it feels like you are all trying to be queen bees picking on workers. You openly gossip about employees to other employees, and when that's addressed you act like it's the person who you're gossiping about's fault. I suggest you also stick to the goals you set for your employees because it feels like every day we are expected to make a change and do it perfectly when most of you don't actually know what's going on but continue to expect us to. Also, prepare better for presentations or any form of public speaking because most of the time they are winged and no one learns anything and we waste our time when we could us it to try and hit the impossible goals you've set. Also, not firing people and helping them grow will probably help the company and is why you're not doing well.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The biggest issue with the company is that they don't care about their employees. For a company that compares itself to companies like Google, Yahoo!, etc., they should look at how those companies treat their employees. Employees at Trunk Club are expected to work investment banking hours with retail salaries and no perks. A 20% discount and the occasional free cocktail from the bar is the extent of the employee perks. I mean they don't even provide free coffee for the employees and they have us sitting in plastic/mesh chairs and don't give us as much as a free pen! Happy employees make hard working employees, but it's been made clear to the employees that Brian Spaly has no interest in caring about his employees. Spaly leads all-hands meetings and has been known to call the sales team offensive and sexist profanities, lazy, compares us to used car salesmen, and shows a complete lack of respect for the people working for him.

Right off the bat they expect you to sell $30K+/Month but they don't give you the tools to be able to do that. They expect you to ""tap into your network"" (ie ask your parents to connect you with their rich friends and coworkers) because it is impossible to sell $30K/Month with the leads that they have sourced for us.

There is no room for growth outside of the sales role. If you don't hit big numbers, they show you the door even if there is another position that would be great for you.

Lastly, but still extremely relevant, upper management is like a group of 4th graders. They are exclusive, rude, dishonest, and unsupportive.

I promise you don't want to work here!","Treat your employees with respect.

You are expected to work 9am - 6pm but also work your appointments in the evenings which run past 9pm, be at Nordstrom to do personal shopping at 6am and expected to work most weekends.

Sales Directors are only hired from within, even if they have never had management experience. Some of the managers were great at sales but are absolutely horrible at managing people or keeping a team together.

Stylists quit by the dozens. Turnover rates are so high and there's never a sense of peace in the office. You're always waiting for the next gossip of someone else that quit or was fired. It's a total revolving door.

Credit and praise is given over and over again to top stylist who have the world's biggest egos. The managers and directors stroke their egos. Many of the stylists would be complete nobodies in the real word and therefore choose to stay at the company.

Not real fashion. All Nordstrom brand. You're a personal shopping and order-taker, not a stylist.

Pay is extremely low and nobody can live on the salary. All the stylists I knew were asking parents for money to support them.

No previous experience is required to get hired here which pretty much means even if you have been in sales or marketing, you are doing the same work that a college student can do. In fact, I sat next to interns for 6 months this summer that did the same work as me.

Sales goals are unreachable. The company allows anybody to sign up for the service, but expects you to sell to million dollar clients. However, most clients sign up and say they shop at Target so it's impossible to sell them a $400 sweater.

You are forced to call your leads an exorbitant number of times. People get really pissed off and want nothing to do with the service. Even if someone spends 5k, you are expected to call them 4 weeks later to sell to them again. Very unnatural and sales-y.

2016-09-06,,,Current Employee ,Phenomena,Phenomena,0,"Note: my review applies to Trunk Club Tech.

Culture: Trunk Club has the best culture, in terms of work life balance, that I've ever seen - and that doesn't just mean people work very little. People always pull together and rally to ship product when they need to, but never feel any pressure to stay late and put in unnecessary hours. I have seen cultures, in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, that err on either side of this but not one that balances things as well as Trunk Club does.

Hiring: Part of the reason for this is that Trunk Club maintains impressively high hiring standards. Everyone is very good at what they do, and the more junior folks are appropriately coached and given opportunities to pair with senior experts in their domains. As a result of this, the Tech organization is extremely flat, and everyone can get exposure to senior leaders (VP level and above) at the company if they want to.

On top of all this, it may be surprising that: everyone is not only very good at what they do, but also really nice. Trunk Club Tech has a very friendly culture - people are remarkably open to pairing and teaching and helping each other.

As an aside: I often wonder how Trunk Club ended up with such a great Tech culture, considering that none of the three co-founders are ""software guys"". First, all three founders are still heavily involved with the company, 6 or 7 years after its founding, which I'm sure helps with hiring. Second, the two founders most closely involved with Tech, John Tucker and Kevin Price, are just all-around good guys, who I'm sure made some good early hires and were happy to let the people with software expertise do their things, (Brian Spaly, the CEO and face of the company, is also very friendly but is spends more time working with the sales teams). And third, Trunk Club has a great brand in the Chicago area. When you tell people you work for Trunk Club, people have usually heard of it. This was part of the reason I joined, and I'm sure has helped with hiring.

Final aside: Trunk Club tech has barely, if at all, been affected by the Nordstrom acquisition. We still manage our entire tech stack, which makes us much more nimble. It still feels like doing tech at a start-up.","Trunk Club is a sales-driven company. A lot of Tech works on products that support the stylists in doing their jobs, rather than running the business itself. Therefore, it can feel like the work you do has less of a direct impact than it could at another company, where the majority of what you're building is a customer-facing product.

While they will tell you (over and over) that YOU TOO can make six-figures before your first year mark, it is a total and complete scam. The only way you can make a living at Trunk Club is to 1. be born into a wealthy, connected family (who will build your client book for you) and 2. be okay alienating yourself from your friends, social circle, etc. because you are required to harass them on a daily/weekly basis.

The monumental workload will distract you from the fact that you have absolutely no idea what you're getting paid and why. Your paychecks become more and more arbitrary and if you dare ask for an explanation, expect to get the run around and continue to waste your already minimal free time. Note that in my single year at Trunk Club, pay was cut drastically (at the expense of stylists) twice.

Management will take OK care of you if you are making them money (40k+ a month) and will throw you to the curb as soon as you show signs of struggle (which will happen because you will never be properly trained or supported). The influx of new stylists-and outflow of fed up ones-keeps what is left of management spread so thin that they are unable to do their actual jobs--maintaining and developing current employees.","There is no doubt in my mind that you are going to continue to lose great employees who WANT to work hard for you because the majority of you are unqualified to be managing in the first place.

2016-09-01, Sales Intern,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Not Worth It,Not Worth It,0,Trunk Club has an awesome clubhouse in Chicago. Met some amazing friends in my intern group. Was able to hear some executives and senior sales directors talk and give some great life advice.,"This internship is run by vary unprofessional, condescending, bland recruiters. They act very excited about you during the interview process and once you are hired. During the intern's orientation they tell you that you will have an experience unlike any other internships out there because you will really be ""making a difference"" for the company. By ""making a difference"" they mean hitting a $30,000 sales goal in which you do not get to keep one cent of the commission. Most of the work for these sales is done on your own, yet you have to transfer the sale to a stylist who did not one ounce of work for the sale. As a senior in college who is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a college degree, it is very disheartening to get hired for the summer internship, and then told that Trunk Club doesn't care what your degree is or if you are even a fashion-forward person because anyone can do the job if they work hard enough. The recruiters who were supposed to be in charge of the interns disappeared for the whole summer and were rude, cold, and short towards the interns. After the internship ended, my clients were passed on to other stylists. Since this has happened two of my clients have received trunks they did not want, and one had to call her stylist over and over again to get a clothing issue resolved. Everyone here is worried about hitting their numbers, not about their clients. On the topic of numbers, this company does not actually recognize hard work. Interns/Stylists who come from wealthy families will hit their sales goal, while others work their butts off and don't and do not receive any recognition for their hard work. Only 3 out of 30 interns hit their sales goal. Interns were told they would hear back about jobs in the next couple weeks, it has now been a month and no one has heard back. Overall, wish I would've spent my summer at a company who does not foster a gossipy, ""fake positive"", uneducated environment that only taught me how to pester people until they bought overpriced, low- quality clothing from me. Along with this, interns had to spend a week working in the warehouse which had no AC. Interns were dreading this week; however, it turned out to be the best week at Trunk Club because we got to get away from the catty, ignorant people at the clubhouse and work with genuinely nice, hard-working people who taught us the ins and outs of the operations management part of the company.","Promote people who are actually educated in management strategies, not just those who can hit their numbers.

2. while it's great that you have somewhat potential to move up because you're promoted from within, it's only based off of your numbers. people that are promoted come from wealthy families hence why they are able to hit sales goals at a fast rate. but, this causes major issues because so many stylists who are over-qualified never move up because they'll never be able to hit certain numbers due to a less robust network.

3. you are flat out lied to about compensation. it's a bit frightening when no one ever knows how much money they're making. they move young girls in who are excited and energetic about the job and told that if they follow certain steps that they will make 6 figures or more within their first yr. NOT TRUE! i've been with the company for awhile and can say confidently that approximately 10 stylists out of 70+ are living above the poverty line which disgusts me because HR and management are aware of this and do nothing to fix it.

4. work hours are beyond strenuous. you're literally on call 24/7 and reprimanded if you're not able to keep up with all of the work because you're never given proper guidance.

5. it's a bunch of really naive people running the company who don't come from a fashion background. most current employees predict that the expansion offices will soon close in less than 5 yrs. if changes aren't made because turnover in the past year has been at an ALL TIME HIGH!

Maybe nice co-workers if you're lucky.

Consistent schedule.

Access to the company bar (in a completely different area of the city).

Pretty easy to steal from if you're that type of employee.

Relatively easy to advance to a low-level management position, only because their managers are overwhelmingly inexperienced and unskilled or don't really want the job at all. Plenty of turnover.","Minimum wage.

Your performance is tracked at all times and the standards for performance are set based on the average performance of the employees; the company exploits this by offering cash incentives to the best employee every month, so minimum-wage workers desperate for more money will push themselves to compete with each other, which in turn drives up the average performance and makes their job harder in the long run.

The managers present a friendly face but business is business and they're only accommodating to the extent that it doesn't cost them anything. Ultimately it comes off as completely fake and condescending - a lot of the managers would talk to employees like children.

The sales staff make commission based on number of items sold which encourages them to send out massive orders which slow down the warehouse employees. The company is supposed to have a maximum shipment size but it's never enforced because more product shipped means more potential sales.

Employees previously had the ability to more or less set their own schedules, but around the time I left (late 2015) this was no longer the case.

Raises occur at a pitifully slow rate - once at 3 months, once at 1 year, and only once every year afterward. Usually only $0.25 or $0.50 increase per raise.","Maybe pay your warehouse workers more since they're literally the only reason the company can operate at all, instead of condescending to them about how their wages are supposedly in line with industry standards.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Much of your day is dedicated to finding new clients (as the leads Trunk Club gives to you are uninformed of the steep prices.) Much of your day will be finding new clients, asking for referrals from current clients and ""checking in"" weekly with current clients to see if they would like another trunk. In this position you will feel like a telemarketer or scummy car salesmen forcing a product that the client does not want/need.

Unattainable goals: The pay structure at Trunk Club is extremely difficult. The base pay comes out to around $1k/pay period ($2k/month). You will start with a monthly goal anywhere between $5k and $20k but within the first four months you will NEED to hit $30k/month. You will feel extremely pressured to hit this goal by management, even receiving the threat of termination.

**in order to receive commission (i.e. a higher paycheck) you will need to hit $30k/month**

Poor/unprofessional leadership: If you take anything away from this post please know that you need to have respect for yourself. At trunk club, you are just another face in the crowd. The leadership continually degrades stylists, even calling them vulgar language and threatening to remove vacation. Just because the company has a startup culture does not mean unprofessionalism is acceptable.

Overall negative moral: The mix of poor management and unattainable goals leads to a very sad work environment. You will constantly feel on edge due to the open work environment and leadership having the power to access your email/chats. Although there is a cool office and startup culture, calling/emailing hundreds of clients a day will eventually catch up to you and you'll wonder what you are doing with your life.","Start from scratch and remove the CEO from the company!

They pay 25 to 50 cents more than minimum wage per hour, presumably so they don't have a reputation for paying poor people minimum wage. It is not a livable wage, and they rarely give people full-time hours with benefits.

There is a good chance that absolutely none of your talents will be put to use. Unless you love manual labor that mainly consists of handling clothes, you aren't going to enjoy the work. I enjoyed going to work sometimes because I had friends there, but they track every possible aspect of your productivity, and management consistently complained that I wasn't working as fast as I possibly could. If you pay me 15 bucks an hour, I will work frantically all day. I would still be underpaid at that wage if I worked frantically, but it would be a livable wage. I was working for less than 10 per hour. After I left minimum wage was raised to 10 per hour. I don't know exactly what they pay now, but I guarantee that they are still taking advantage of people with few to no options.

They hire some people that are simply just not quality people. I was physically assaulted by a Co worker at a new years party, and he started stalking me after he left Trunk Club, to the point where I had to file a police report.

They provide a training program for new hires, give you exposure to their executive team (CEO included), provide a great office environment (no cubicles!), have a coffee bar (yes, they charge employees $1) and regular bar for employees and clients (no charge), in addition to offering full benefits, a base salary and generous compensation plan. It is still a growing company so they will continue to make mistakes, but they always own up to them and are very transparent with what is going on. Almost all promotions are done internally and anyone interested in relocating to a new office has the opportunity to do so. You don't have to wait around for 3 years before given the opportunity for advancement. Many promotions happen within the first year to two years. And there is no glass ceiling for how much you can make. Does everyone make a lot? No. But that's the point of sales. Top performers earn the most but everyone has the same opportunities. And there are no territories! You can find your own clients anywhere. For those who struggle in prospecting (a standard sales practice), Trunk Club actually provides warm leads for stylists to call.","Sales is a tough job. It's easy to get down on yourself and feel like you are spinning your wheels at times especially if you are working hard and not seeing immediate results. But if you want to be paid the same as everyone else, you shouldn't take a sales job. You get paid commission for doing more than your peers and the hard work adds up and pays off later on. Trunk Club could do a better job at setting that expectation early on and letting new hires know that it isn't going to be easy but for those who stick with it, they can easily make 6 figures---it just may take 2-3 years. And because the environment is casual and friendly, it's easy to get caught up in forgetting that it's actually a job you are being paid to do. There is a generous vacation policy and laid back atmosphere, but that is for those who are hitting goals and are top performers. Pretty standard for any sales job. If someone wants to work 40 hours and take a lot of vacations, they absolutely can. They just won't make a lot of money if they are early in their career and building a book of business.",Set realistic expectations for new hires on what to expect during their first year on the job.

- My training was never consistent and I felt like my leads and managers were never focused on getting us fully trained as much as they were trying to balance many different projects at once, which they did unsuccessfully.
- My managers and leads are a bunch of fake, lying, disrespectful girls that acted like children. They told me nice things to my face about my job performance, and then badmouthed me to the head of the department behind my back, leading to my early termination. That stereotype of suburban/lincoln park wealthy entitlement?? This company is full of people like that.

On my last day of my third week, after being told I was doing a wonderful job so far by everyone on my team including my managers, I was called into a small office with two HR reps and the head of my department where I was terminated early. I tried to ask them what happened and they told me it was a combination of things: I wasn't a good cultural fit, my responses to customers were not improving, I was responding negatively to feedback and was unpleasant overall.

All of this took me by shock...I was told for the first 3 weeks that I was doing an amazing job in all of my work and I was very friendly and looking to improve, and all of a sudden the head of my department, who didn't work with me at all, was telling me that my managers were actually badmouthing me to her, saying things that were the complete opposite of my great job performance. And the vague reasons they did give me as to why I was being fired were things that could have been improved through working and continuing to learn. They wouldn't even give me the chance to do better, they just made a final decision and I had no say in the matter, nor was I given second or third chances to improve which is what they promised us in the beginning. They lied about many things and I feel I was fired because of some image issue that they didn't like....I guess that's what happens when you work in a company with mostly overdramatic, entitled girls who care more about image than hard work. It is a high end fashion retail company after all.","-Balance the workforce to even out the men/women scale....there needs to be more real people that work in your company rather than a bunch of over-dramatic, entitled, mean-spirited people.
- Make sure you hire managers and leads that are actually older and have more work experience rather than being fresh out of college.
- Even though it is a fashion company, hire and reward people based on their hard work rather than their image and how they look and act towards others...that is important but it's not the most important thing, nor does it make a company successful.",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
2015-06-16, Sales,,Former Employee ,Honestly. Just...Don't.,Honestly. Just...Don't.,0,I had a somewhat coherent conversation with the coffee guy...once. Is that a PRO?,"Take Feminism back 50 years and work at TRUNK CLUB!

You will be surrounded by disposable 20 somethings relying on their parents credit cards or fiancee's income to survive at this sick joke of a job.

You will be told to treat prospecting for clients ""like dating""

You will be told to build your business by enticing clients with free booze (put that college degree to WORK, ladies!)

It will be impossible to focus over the constant day long chatter about juice cleanses, Tinder dates and where someone's parents were taking them on vacation.

Every other word you will hear from the sales team will literally be literally. Like, literally.

You will be asked by the CEO if you're afraid and why you dared take a day off over a nationally recognized holiday and then to feel sorry for him because when he started the company only had $XXX,XXX (ummm, that's a hefty six figures for those of you keeping track at home) in the bank. So he knows what it's like.

You will be pushed to work 50 hours a week for what amounts to less than minimum wage on a 26k salary, prospecting for clients in an oversaturated market (be prepared to watch men run the other direction when you tell them where you work).

If you leave at 5:45pm you will be asked if you're taking a ""half day"".

Your emails will be read. Your performance will be gossiped about by management and team members. Remember High School? It's like going in to debt while working your tail off just to go straight back.

Very few individual sales people (to call oneself a stylist is an insult to those actually working in the industry) will succeed. The company is relying on unachievable sales goals and a bottomless supply of naive 20 somethings who are continually replaced at an astounding rate.

 You will work hard, the company will profit. You will not.
