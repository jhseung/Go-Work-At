2019-04-16, Web Event Services Supervisor,"Portland, OR",Current Employee ,Upward Movement at West,Upward Movement at West,0,"West allows for upward momentum for employees that apply themselves and are clear about their goals. In the 3.5 years that I have been here, I have had 2 major promotions and now make $10 more per hour than I did when I started. West appreciates smart, hard-working individuals and both of my promotions were given to me over people with more seniority who lacked the same drive. Despite that, I have only worked more than 45 hrs/week on a couple of occasions in 3 years. Overtime is not an expectation for success.

I have also been given opportunities to explore different interests and areas within the company so that I don't get bored and I continue growing and learning.

My immediate team and management here in Portland are very friendly and down-to-earth. They are very understanding of life events and do their best to help their employees in and outside their work.

We get a fair amount of PTO. Benefits are decent, if not spectacular.","West gets bogged down by bureaucracy. Once you get outside of my section of the company, it gets much more difficult to make changes, even if they seem obvious and have been ""in the works"" for years.

West is a large company and it is not uncommon to feel that you are just one cog in a machine.

Upper management has a tendency to make changes to benefits or programs and spin them to appear like positive changes, but which actually harm employees. The company has made 3 major acquisitions/mergers in the 3 years that I've been here (along with many small changes) and this has resulted in promises and policies made by the company not being honored down the line because the management team or our priorities have changed.

They do seem like they are doing better lately, but take everything you hear from the top levels of management with a grain of salt.

Also, sometimes work can be uneven. Overwhelming one week and very slow the next. Luckily, Christmastime and summer are the slowest seasons for my team.","Work for better communication and connection between different levels of the company and work to make the changes that matter to your employees, rather than just the ones that matter to the company's bottom line.

2018-11-03, Sales Associate,"Appleton, WI",Current Employee ,A great job for those who like to stick to the basics.,A great job for those who like to stick to the basics.,0,"You choose your hours as long as you hit 40, as a sales rep you pretty much have complete freedom with breaks and such as long as you're hitting your numbers, the job itself is easy to do and doesn't require much, great achievable bonus potential, constant opportunities for advancement, they promote from within, management is helpful and supportive but doesn't stand over your shoulder or micro-manage. Fun activities and challenges to help motivate higher metrics, you can socialize throughout the day and they encourage it as long as everyone is doing their jobs. I've worked at Alta before coming here and it's a completely different environment-- much more welcome and friendly, much more freedom.","Being a call center, things change a lot, people get switched around between teams, turnover isn't the greatest so people are in and out. A bit of workplace social drama but it's easy enough to stay out of. You have to use PTO for sick days and leaving early, doctor's appointments, etc, instead of having the option to just take the missed time unpaid and save your PTO for when you actually need it, but I understand that because to qualify for benefits you need to consistently hit 40 hours. But if you miss so much as fifteen minutes and don't make up the time later in the week, your PTO gets applied to it. In the same area, when I originally interviewed, PTO was awarded on anniversaries for staying with the company, which was a huge factor in why I decided to work here. This reward system has since been removed, so there is less PTO potential throughout the year. There is no food or blankets allowed on the floor for sanitary reasons but it's kind of a pain to have to sit in the breakroom any time you need to snack on something when you could be getting work done and munching between dials. The pay is decent but it's mid-range and raises aren't really a thing unless you get promoted or you've been there for many years.","PTO is a huge motivator in a call-center environment -- regardless of how fun and engaging you guys really do make the job, working in a call center is an emotionally taxing and draining job, no matter what. That isn't West's fault, but having more days off, in my opinion, reduces turnover and gives us much needed time away from the hundreds of dials to not-so-happy people we make every day. It was a huge aspect of the interview process that your HR people emphasized as a benefit, and now it's being changed in what I interpret as kind of a shady way. I get that you have numbers to hit with the clients' expectations, but losing more people and having to fill empty cubicles because they're tired of making dials day in and day out with no time off isn't going to help your numbers. This is a fantastic company with a wonderful HR team that knows what they're doing, understands the work and doesn't forget what it was like to be on the floor. Don't lose that aspect.",4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0
