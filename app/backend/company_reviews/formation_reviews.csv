2018-12-19,,,Former Employee ,Unfortunately it's all true and Formation has gone downhill,,0,"- Wonderful opportunity that was squandered
- Many smart, dedicated people
- Good pay and benefits
- Centrally located in SF","- Dysfunctional and inexperienced founding team that wreaked havoc
- CEO that gets knocked over with a feather and listens to whoever has his attention
- No product or product strategy
- Manipulative and backstabbing culture","Realize that your actions mean a whole lot more than what you say. Culture, principles, etc are only meaningful when you demonstrate them in practice. Treat people with respect and they will respect you and go beyond in return.

Don't try to manipulate reviews about the company. It makes you look bad. For example, the negative review on 12/12/2018 was quickly followed with three positive reviews on 12/17 that had barely any content and looked like boilerplate.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
2018-12-12,,,Current Employee ,Lots of false promises,,0,"The culture is really good on paper and the CEO is super friendly to everyone, so he is well liked (but generally viewed as weak and not ready for the job).","Unfortunately a lot of what happens is all talk and the reality does not match. It took me several months to realize that there is a lot of back-stabbing and infighting in the leadership and among the founders which tears at company culture. I'm also really worried about how difficult it has been to get our Tech house in order. we are constantly revamping our platform and cannot meet client needs. The CEO over sells what we can do ant clients are inevitably disappointed. I loved the claimed company culture, but the longer I'm here the more I realize that it is mostly talk and there is a lot of toxic conflict between the builders and the business/CEO.","Stop the conflict. I was told that the CEO has had a falling out with multiple tech leaders including his co-founders CTO, VPE etc. This is at the core of the problems at formation. I would recommend that the CEO move to more of a sales role and find a replacement who can work with tech better, for the good of the company.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

I've been at the company for about 1.5 years and have seen the company grow a ton. We have lofty goals that are challenging, and you get to work with some of the best engineers, product managers, and business people around the world.","It's a startup so it's hard work, but the company really respects the need to recharge and have a life but it's definitely not a huge structured company.

2018-02-13,,,Former Employee ,High hopes at first followed by a negative culture trend,,0,"- Functional programming (Haskell)
- Good health insurance and benefits
- Great pool of engineers and product talents
- Somewhat flexible work hours
- CEO has a healthy vision for the company","- Some managers are just yes men & women. They care way more about how to please the CEO than helping their teams grow.
- Decisions are made based on personal relationships and ‘who is the boss’. Rather than metrics/work ethic or the quality of an idea.
- People have realized speaking up is not a good idea because the ones who do are either fired or working under a fine tooth comb, with everything they do being criticized.
- The HR climate has become toxic.","Ensure your management picks match the vision you want to make, you are still a growing company and they have a big impact on your employee’s experiences",1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

- Huge opportunity for personal impact and growth, and very cool to be working with only the largest, most well-known global companies as a Series A startup

- Flexible everything--unlimited PTO (that people actually use), WFH, autonomy, etc.

- Building something incredible and having a lot of fun along the way","- Not necessarily a con, but as with any fast-growing company it comes with its own share of unique (but fun and interesting) challenges, and you need to be adaptable and open to change as the company continues to evolve and grow",Keep it up!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2017-03-06,,,Current Employee ,Amazing team with ambitious goals,,0,"The founding team has brought together a group of intellectually driven, hard-working, and bright folks who are working towards some pretty lofty goals. The company is still small enough that you can make a direct impact on the culture (and management is very receptive of that!) and Takt's long-term trajectory.

I love knowing that my work matters and that leadership cares about my opinion. Of course, as we scale, this may or may not change.

Super transparent and supportive work-environment. Work styles vary throughout the company which some people (choosing to or having to) work around the clock while others pursue the traditional 9 - 6 PM schedule.",Company tries to be flexible around work style / work-life balance but there is some pressure to stay and work late.,Please continue to re-visit our technical and business goals to strike the right balance.,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
