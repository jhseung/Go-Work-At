If ""Change is the only constant"" does not sound appealing, then Gusto may not be the happiest place for you.
-Super fast face growth - this can be a lot to handle and if you take part of interviewing it feels like you have two jobs
-There were higher cash offers out there so if you do not value equity you can likely find better offers
-Start up ""quirks"" - i.e no shoes, unique terminology (employees = gusties, PE = manager, etc) - Not a con in my book but if you looking for somewhere conventional then Gusto may fall short",Keep doing what you are doing! Gusto is unique and that is the best part about it!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2019-02-21, Recruiting,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Fast-growing, customer centric & still shoeless!",More than 3 years,0,"I've been a full time employee at Gusto for over 3 years. I love that I work at a company that is actually solving a meaningful problem for an underserved market. Gusto is a mission driven company and genuinely focuses on doing the right thing for our internal employees and our customers.

What has kept me at Gusto? I get to work with talented people, working on a challenging problems, and have had incredible career growth along the way. I love that my day to day work has a high level of ambiguity, ownership, visibility, and impact .

Even though we have grown quickly I feel like Gusto has stayed authentic to our values and maintained a consistent culture. For example, we are still a shoe-less office which might seem crazy given that we are over 850 employees. At the same time, I appreciate that we have kept the tradition alive because it aligns to our collaborative approach to work and ""no egos"" mentality.

On a personal note, Gusto has been a sustainable long-term career fit for me because I have flexibility when it comes to taking time off and working from home when needed. We have ""flexible PTO"" and I typically take off, ~4 weeks/ year. When life happens and I can't make it into the office, my manager has always been understanding and supportive.",We've grown from 150 employees to over 850 employees in 3 years across two headquarter locations. Gusto is scaling quickly and with any scaling company there are growing pains. The specific growing pains that I have experienced is that our internal processes and tools are always catching up to match the size and stage of the business.,Continue to focus on our internal teams- I'd love to see Gusto roll out a 401K matching program for employees!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

- Flexible work hours
-Frequent company events","-No vacation time. Don't be fooled by the ""unlimited"" vacation time. You will never get it. You will work, work, work, and wonder when that vacation time is coming, and then it will be back to work, work, work.
- Your job description will not be what you are doing.
- You won't be able to take your first year ""fly-away"" because your time off will be black listed. Unless you plan to take off during very specific times in the summer, forget about it.
- Your salary does not match the amount of responsibility you will have. You will take on the workload of an account manager (usually paid between 60-70k in the Denver area), but be paid at an associate level
- Despite being a theoretical owner in the company, you will have no idea what is going on with management
- A very ""clique"" high-school environment. Many individuals with inflated egos who make others feel inadequate. If you were not part of the ""in"" crowd in college or high school, you're going to have a hard time fitting in here
- A shocking lack of diversity. Coming from a lower-middle income family, an example of individuals who would benefit from small-business support that Gusto provides, you will find very little of this at Gusto. Think of an ivory tower. That is what you will find. I have encountered nobody from a similar upbringing at Gusto.
- No matching 401k. With the vesting in stock, this is almost understandable, until you learn you are not fully vested until your 5th year
- Your work will be an albatross around your neck. There is no escaping it. It may seem like a salary job, until you see the wage paycheck. Be prepared to constantly check your email and internal messaging system, even on weekends, evenings, and on holidays. Again, this would be acceptable if expectations were set beforehand and wages were set at what a standard salary job is in the Denver area.
- Your career opportunities will never be clearly defined. I have not been employed at Gusto for a long period of time, however, more tenured employees have expressed that that there is a cloud around future career opportunities.
- Work-life balance is abysmal. Unless you are single and have nothing else to do, you will be hard-pressed to find time for your out of work life. Gusto will be your life - at an entry level pay. Unacceptable unless you have never had a job.
- If you are right out of college, this may seem like an amazing opportunity. However, if you have had a job in the finance industry, particular in the Denver area, you will quickly learn how abysmally underpaid you are at Gusto","Be honest about the jobs that are posted. They certainly do not boast an ""entry level"" workload. I have had careers with significantly less workloads with similar pay.

2018-09-23,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Politics are abound and no work-life balance,More than a year,0,Beautiful brand new office (see pictures),"1). Inexperienced Managers
If you search the reviews here, you will notice one common thing: people are promoted as manager or hired as one but without actual managerial experiences. It seems that the company is not aware that a manager is someone that have leadership qualities and focus on managing people first and project second.

2). Old guards and “clique” culture
Many employees have been around for a long time and this create an almost “clique” culture. If you have disagreement with these people, especially those who have been promoted to a manager position (see above), very likely the other old guards will back them up and you will lose out. Playing the politics game is a must given that the approach is more of “my way or the highway”.

3). Lack of collaboration
Business units often will execute projects without consulting other respective teams. When they realized that other teams need to be involved, they will demand that the other teams to complete the project in a very short time.

4). Work-life balance
Given all the above and depending on your team, work-life balance is almost non-existent. You will be tasked with so much work that long hours, including weekends, is not unheard of. If you push back, see all of the above.","Start a 360-degree feedback review for ALL employees and anonymous Q&A during company-wide meetings.

# The Space - Our new office is BEAUTIFUL! There's lots of extra desk space, couch space, and opportunity to stand/sit away from your desk. Plus I love our community mural (and the couches are comfy :-). There are also little tributes around the office to our Gusto customers!

# The Culture - We're encouraged to celebrate our peers' victories, cover for each other when OOO, and take time off to be with family and volunteer. There's a culture of care and empathy here at Gusto that I haven't experienced anywhere else. There's also a lot of transparency within the company.

The people are genuinely kind and extremely talented. People practice healthy debate and feedback.

The culture here is phenomenal. People are truly bought in (and how could you not be, they're making a difference in the lives of everyday people), and they bring that passion to everything that happens here. I also believe that Gusto invests in the right places. Being a company in the HR space, they strive to be a good example to other companies in terms of how they develop their culture and treat employees. This comes out in so many ways -- how they conduct interviews, free meals in the office, speaker series. They're good at taking best practices from other companies that are doing things well and applying it within.","Gusto is growing really quickly. It's apparent that they are going through a transition and there will naturally be growing pains. My sense is that some Gusties are onboard with this, and those that have been here longer have mixed feelings. Typical for a company that scales that fast. But fortunately it's not as divisive as I've seen in other companies. Gusto is hyper aware of keeping a steady balance during their growth.

2017-09-27,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best job I've ever had,Less than a year,0,"I feel thankful every day to be working here. At Gusto, we talk about creating an atmosphere where people get to do ""the best job of their lives"". I often have to pinch myself because this seems to be true for me.

I can't speak for every individual on every team, but the career gods did me a solid and gave me an amazing manager (experienced! nurturing! structured!) and a set of interesting, impactful projects to solve. If you'd like to increase your chances of winning the career lottery, go into your interviews with eyes wide open and ask thoughtful questions about who you'll be managed by, who else they're managing, and what work you'll be doing in the first 3, 6, 12 months. Be honest with yourself about whether the job will still excite you two years from now.

Ok, now on to more things that I love:

Culture = the real deal, across all teams. People here are genuinely friendly and supportive. I'd describe Gusto as the warm, comforting friend who gives great hugs. I haven't yet seen any signs of a toxic workplace culture.

Trajectory = it's a great time to join the company because it feels both scrappy + structured, if that's even possible. Each office is ~200 people or less, so it does feel more intimate than a larger mid-sized tech company. We've also brought in seasoned leaders on the Biz side who have put in more guardrails and accountability in place (OKRs!), yet teams are still lean enough that your work still feels very close to the heart of the business.

Side note: before I accepted my offer, I read through older Glassdoor reviews and (admittedly) got nervous about references to mandatory Glassdoor postings and lack of job security. Now that I'm on the other side, I can gladly say that I've seen no evidence to support those claims, so it may have been isolated events in the company's past.","Sure, there are creative re-orgs and some disgruntled (typically early) employees as the company grows, but people, have you worked anywhere else?! Things could be MUCH worse. I previously worked at a fancy unicorn tech company, and those hyper-growth growing pains were real ugly and nothing close to anything Gusto is experiencing.

Extra things to think about:

Cash comp is not competitive to top-tier tech companies. I took a cash pay cut to work here and said goodbye to a handful of cushy perks. At the same time, I increased my overall happiness by 10x since working at Gusto, so it was worth it to me.

If you're in a customer-facing role (CX, Sales), you should know that our business is cyclical and peaks during Dec - Feb, so don't expect to take those 2-week long vacations from Christmas to New Years.

This isn't the type of company where you can ""WFH"" 2 days/week, schedule in mid-day workouts, take 2 week vacations each quarter, and get away with it. If you're looking to coast, go to a large tech company. That being said, setting boundaries between work/non-work life is manageable, but up to you. 4-5 weeks of PTO is the general practice, if you need to WFH on the occasional day, you can. The Biz side of the office clears out around 5:30-6pm, but people are heads-down all the way until then, and may work online in the evenings if needed.",Product side is looking pretty lean these days. Hope you all are looking into the root causes and finding ways to give that org more love.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

Mass exodus happening lately (half the product team left, sales people leaving and worse - engineers are leaving as well). This is abnormal turnover.

+ All of my coworkers are extremely nice and friendly. Everyone at the company cares deeply about the problem that Gusto is trying to solve. “Do the right thing” is one of Gusto’s core values and it shows in everything that we do from our large projects to the small things that people do every day for each other.

+ Extremely cooperative environment. I have had the opportunity to work on some challenging projects, but management does not drop a project on you and turn away. They provide plenty of support whenever you need it. My coworkers are always extremely willing to help.

+ Work-life balance has improved a lot over the years. The company actively encourages employees to take time off and I have never felt that I was prevented to do something because of work.

+ Introspection is a core part of the culture at Gusto. We regularly review the current status of the team and company and we evaluate how things can be better.

+ Gusto has all of the things you would expect from a Silicon Valley tech firm, but nothing feels over the top. It has amazing benefits, free lunch and dinner, fun social events, and a casual work environment. Additionally, Gusto offers a free trip anywhere in the world after 1 year at the company.","- The SF office could be nicer, but they've done a great job of making the space feel cozy and welcoming.

- There is no time to cruise here at Gusto. Everyone is tasked with ambitious projects with aggressive deadlines.","+ Keep building for the businesses that need the most help instead of the ones that will make us the most money. I'm glad you guys care so much about all of our customers.

+ Leadership shows that they care a lot about their employees. Keep being accessible and making time to meet everyone at the company.

- Be more willing to take risks. Don’t be afraid to take on larger and more challenging projects.

+ People really, truly cares about our customers. Everybody from support to sales to engineering is passionate about helping others. This all too often gets lost at fast growing startups.
 
+ As an extension of the above...our product and service are incredible. We only compete in markets where we definitively have the best offering, and in my humble view there is a huge amount of potential for the company because we're just scratching the surface.
 
+ The culture is very open. It supports honest, transparent discussion, and decisions tend to be more bottoms-up than tops-down. The executive team is both forthcoming with the information they have and trusting of the teams that do things day to day.","- Payroll, Benefits, and HR are highly regulated, which somewhat limits our creative freedom.

+ Ownership mentality is a real thing. The company places emphasis on trusting in individuals to learn, grow, and achieve goals. If you ask for help, there is always tremendous support. For me, this ability to work autonomously and conquer new challenges every day is is invaluable.

+ Fun, energetic workplace. Both our Denver and SF offices are dynamic places to be. Some days, there is a literal buzz in the air. Dress code is casual and, of course, you can wear your favorite slippers or socks.

+ The PEOPLE here are talented, smart, and driven. I'm constantly learning new things from my peer group, the people on my team inspire me with their work ethic and desire to grow, and senior leadership takes time to engage with Gusties at all levels.

+ The benefits: great health insurance options, a ""Flyaway"" (1 year ticket anywhere) on your 1 Year Anniversary, packages for new parents, fertility options to name a few. Our HR team is thoughtful in making selections while doing the right thing for our stage in the business.

+ The culture is truly accepting and open. I feel like I can be my true self at Gusto and I am confident that my peers value me as much for my differences as similarities.

+ Equity for all employees. Our finance team has constructed one of the most thoughtful equity offerings in the Valley to make everyone owners of the business.

+ The company is doing really well and doing things the right way. Given the complexity of our business and the importance of staying compliant, I'm proud of the way we've built our business while still moving fast. We've got big goals and we continue to focus on the customer and why we're building this business - to create a world where work empowers a better life.","- The SF work space is not the Taj Mahal but the great snacks, meals, couches and other comfy seating, location in SoMa next to cafes, bars, South Park, and other neighborhood gems make up for it.

- I gave work/life balance 4 stars. For the most part, I'm the reason for lack of balance. However, there are a handful of times each year, when we stack too many things into one time period and work/life balance becomes difficult to achieve with even the most disciplined approach. That said, I have control of my schedule, there's unlimited PTO, and senior leadership is getting better at pacing intensive work periods and prioritizing more ruthlessly.

- I gave compensation 4 stars. I'm VERY happy with my benefits & compensation. That said, at this stage in my career I prioritize equity, great benefits, the culture/people and career opportunities over pure cash comp. If you're looking for cash comp at 100th percentile of market, you may be disappointed. If you take the view of total compensation, you'll be happy.","- Continue to focus on driving clarity and focus at all levels of the business so our talented, passionate teams work on the most important things.

They claim that they are one big happy family, In reality there is an ""in"" crowd, and if you're not in it, you have to walk on egg shells and you never really know if your job is secure.

They claim that they are in it for the long haul and that you should take vacation when you need it, and have a good work life balance. In reality, they over worked everyone, trying to hit quarter targets, and didn't pay anyone overtime or give anyone a bonus. They had to switch a bunch of people over to hourly to avoid work regulation law suits. They worked everyone to the bone, to where we couldn't have lives outside of the office, and then when this was brought up to hire ups, we were scolded.

They say they look at people as people, and that you are not a resource like at other companies. Well at least at other companies they don't just blatantly lie about it. They worked everyone to the bone, and eventually laid off over half the Growth team, which included Sales and Marketing. They set up bogus PIPs that were lose lose situations, where the quotas were unattainable, and the work done to achieve crazy numbers was devalued. Then they made it seem like it was your fault when they let you go, even though later higher ups admitted they had screwed up in hiring, Which still doesn't make sense, because if they had as much as they said they did, and they cared about people, People could have still technically kept their jobs, as they were fulfilling about 140% of their role and definitely working more than what they were being compensated for.

2016-04-27,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best place to get ahead!,Less than a year,0,"- Gusto is the type of place where you can make a ton of impact very quickly. People are very open to having others jump in and help on projects, which allows folks to get all kinds of different experiences. There is no one way in which things have to work and people are always looking to make things better and more efficient.

- The leadership works hard to make sure that employees know that they are being appreciated. The HR team bends over backwards to provide state of the art benefits programs (including an insane 401k program which includes up to 8% matching, ability to early exercise, no golden handcuffs after 3 years of tenure, reproductive benefits, an awesome maternity/paternity package) and the Golden ticket program, allowing employees to travel abroad on the Company's dime).

- I get a lot of autonomy to spearhead initiatives and work at my own pace. Yes, there is A LOT to do - this is a quickly growing start-up and we need to work hard to keep the momentum going. HOWEVER, when I need to be out or take a long vacation, everyone is extremely supportive. I never feel like I have to stay late - I sometimes stay late because I want to. I think that a lot of other people are in the same boat. It's exciting to be working at a place that's building new products and it's ok that we have to work late sometimes to be able to move us forward. That said, most of the office clears out by 6pm, so I'm very confused by the other reviewers saying that they are made to work long hours.

- The culture is amazing - everyone is very kind, helpful and intelligent. I'm friends with many of my co-workers and we do things outside of work every week or so. The vibe in the office is very lively and many of the visitors I've brought to the office for lunch or dinner have commented that many people are smiling and there is a noticeable happy energy in the office.

- The leadership is very positive and driven. They work hard, but they also set the tone for work-life balance by going abroad for vacations, completely disconnecting from work.","- We are growing very quickly and that means that sometimes the managers do not have time to mentor and develop their employees. This is a good and a bad thing. It will work perfectly (and is very empowering) for those who can do their own legwork to figure out where they want their career to go. It will not work for those who expect to be spoon-fed or who don't like ambiguity.

Some of the root issues found in any workplace become exacerbated due to the high number of millennials who believe they are entitled to hold leadership positions so they can boss other people around, despite having proven very little in terms of actual ability to perform or personal work ethic.

It seemed like somewhere that was thoughtful and really cared about its employees and customers. Once I started, I realized that what they cared about was how much work they could get out of each employee.

The leadership team talks about the values so much that you can recite them in your sleep. While they all seem great in theory, it becomes clear after awhile that they are almost all focused around making this job your life. Managers would often say ""it's a marathon not a sprint"" and talks all the time about taking breaks, but still expect each employee to 60-70 hours every week and keep up with emails after hours and on weekends with no break at all.

The thirst that recruiters and hiring managers have for getting Ivy-League talent is unreal. I was in multiple conversations with hiring managers who would reject a candidate because they didn't have the ""background they were looking for"" or they weren't a ""culture fit"" which almost always meant that they didn't go to an impressive enough school or have amazing companies on their resume prior to interviewing at Gusto. I'm all for keeping the bar high, but that kind of elitism is really disconcerting especially for a company who's mission is ""putting people first"".

I think the biggest disappointment came from seeing just how obsessed Gusto is with being seen as ""the best place to work"" but how little they actually care about making sure employees are happy. They treat it as an honor to even be able to be part of the team and I saw them let a startling amount of employees go in the year that I was there. The leadership's rhetoric around this was that ""people should be at a company that is the best fit for them. We really appreciate all they've done for Gusto, but ultimately felt that they would be better suited somewhere else."" Behind the scenes, these employees were working insane hours, had very little to no direction from their managers, and were killing themselves to try to keep their jobs.

Funny that the biggest mantra at the company that the leadership and everyone else who's drowned in the cool aid preaches on the regular yet that's exactly how they treat their own employees. If you can make it through their rigorous Interview process, congrats. You're part of the ""lucky 1%"" who apply and end up joining. The company does a great job of making you feel like you're joining a ""family"" but after your first couple of weeks, your ""family"" is already too busy welcoming the next batch of new hires to care about you. If you don't start working on some highly visible projects, you'll be seen as not contributing and likely start getting flagged as a replaceable resource.

The amount of Stanford nepotism at the company is insane. Good luck moving up the ranks if you didn't go to Stanford for undergrad or get an mba there. Pretty much 99% of the young leadership went there and it's disgusting how high their noses are sometimes.

There are way too many smart people there doing mindless work just for the company name. Morale is incredibly low across multiple teams but their managers aka PE's (people empowerer) get them to truck along with the false promise of switching teams and taking on more responsibilities. The term ""PE"" is a joke. They don't empower you to do anything. If you saying anything negative about the work you're doing or the company, you'll get shunned from your ""family"".

Don't believe the 5-star reviews on here. They're likely all from the HR team or written by new hires in their first week since that's one of the to dos when you join. Seriously?

I'm glad there are more and more honest reviews on here since the company doesn't actually care about their employees. They work you day and night and on weekends without any remorse. The ceo has openly said he doesn't believe in work life balance because if you love your job, there's no difference.

Employees are not set up for success and live in fear of being let go at any moment despite good performance.

Management is like an old boys club of Ivy league grads and heavy favoritism plays a part into who gets opportunities versus who does not. This is not at all a meritocracy.

Gusto drills it's values into every employee's head to where you could recite them in your sleep, but in the past 8 months, actually living up to these values has all but been abandoned. The commonly recited slogan is ""Humans are not resources"" though this is EXACTLY how employees are treated. I agree with every single critical review here and as you can see there is a running theme. You can't expect for the company to do well, and for employees to be passionate about company goals when employees themselves are not treated properly. There is very little recognition for success, but if you're not doing well, don't expect to be given any feedback or even keep your job.

The facade of culture and community is trumped by an underlying sense of resentment that is growing amongst employees, and management and the people team seem to refuse to admit or recognize this. There is absolutely zero career development and the lack of titles does not set up anyone for success for the future of their career. I understand this was done to avoid egos developing internally, but there are definitely huge egos within Gusto that have nothing to do with job title.

Many employees are overqualified for their job titles, and not given any room to grow within the company. All management and upper level positions are posted on our career website, no promoting from within.","Take these critical reviews more seriously than just bypassing them as disgruntled ex-employees who are upset for losing their job.

- Values are highlighted and touted regularly but sometimes there is a lack of follow-through (transparency about people being let go, prioritizing short term sprints over long term goals) For a company that is so people and values driven, Gusto falls short (not always, but sometimes) and a lot of the unhappiness from people stems from the fact that there are very high expectations on how the company should operate.

Best of all, when it's clear that the employees want to see something change, the change comes more often than not. When we expressed that peer review feedback was lacking, the People team put together a performance development program. When our org structure was holding us back, the leads adjusted quickly.

I've never worked harder in my life, and I've never been as happy to get out of bed everyday and come into a dynamic exciting work environment full of people I consider friends. This isn't a stuffy or pretentious workplace- we don't just hire people with shiny degrees from elite schools. We hire people who share our values and who we feel can contribute meaningfully to the team. I think that upper management spends a great deal of time thinking about what it means to ""work"" and how it should be meaningful, creative, and challenging- and how it can give you a sense of ownership, identity and pride.

The people here are smart, driven individuals who are all hungry to contribute to our company's continued growth and success at break-neck speeds.

The perks are great (free breakfast/lunch/dinner, gym stipend, transportation stipend, a golden ticket to fly anywhere in the world on your one-year anniversary) and the culture is fun, with a shoe-less office and a Halloween costume contest where a large majority of the office dressed up.

In my short time here I have already had the opportunity to work on projects I've had no experience with working on in the past and it's been fun and exciting to feel like I am learning and growing again after having stagnated in my previous job. One of our values is an ownership mentality, and that is embodied throughout our team, with the support to test and experiment and take on responsibility for ideas you come up with.

There is so much growth and opportunity for us, and it's exciting to be a part of the team that's making it all happen!","As expected at a start-up there is a lot of change and movement, both organizationally and also responsibility-wise. As we like to say, change is the only constant, so you have to be prepared to roll with the punches, and not get too attached to any specific ideas or even your seat.","Continue with the great job you've been doing hiring talented and motivated people, and making sure our culture doesn't suffer as we scale.",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

+ Strong business fundamentals and broad market. Every small business with employees needs to compensate them. It's the first service these companies invest in, and it's the last they divest in if their business is struggling.

+ Transparency. Every two weeks we get a rundown of how the company is doing, and the strategic perspective helps me make day to day choices.

+ Full-stack engineering. I walked in as a front-end engineer, and I'm now making edits on everything from deployment scripts and database queries to API endpoints and CSS.

+ Pair programming. Engineering here is deeply collaborative. I feel really comfortable reaching out to anyone in the engineering org for a pairing session. There's no shame in asking for help (unlike the org I came from) and I learn a lot every time I pair with someone.

+ We don't have everything figured out yet. There are lots of opportunities to make a big impact, and there's very little process hampering individuals from making changes.","- We don't have everything figured out yet. We're hitting internal scaling limits on a lot of our ad-hoc processes, and we're still trying to figure out how to communicate in ways that are more durable and inclusive than Slacking.

- Like most businesses of our size, the time investment is significantly greater than at a larger company.

- The open plan is especially noisy due to the construction materials in the current office (lots of hard surfaces).

- We rename everything. I appreciate the spirit behind it (trying to communicate a mindset that's different than industry standards), but it gets unwieldy, especially when talking to folks who are thinking about working here.","~ Keep up the communication! As the staff grows, it will be harder and harder to maintain the same clarity of transparency that we have now.

Everything you read on here can't even be taken at face value - as part of their on-boarding process, they have each new hire write a review! Of course it's all positive on day 1!","Beware - this company does NOT know what it's doing or how to treat employees. They have managers who have never managed or even mentored others assuming supervisory roles, and doing an awful job at it. It's quite the norm to hear negative talk being said behind your back, from your own manager! I guess that's what happens when they have 20 year olds managing.

Gusto provides absolutely no training, structure, or really anything for you to be successful in your role, and when you ask for some guidance, they fire you. They let people go with absolutely no warning, which is not only unethical, it's scary. It is a VERY unhealthy culture. Cliques are also the norm, so if you're not in the ""in"" crowd, be prepared to feel unwelcome. It's almost like you're back in high school working here!

Most people value a work/life balance. Don't ever expect to have that here! They provide 3 meals a day, and don't serve dinner until after 6:30pm, so they expect you to basically live there. Come on, this isn't Google we're talking about. They look down on those who don't stay late, and when I say late, it's the norm to work past 11pm...every single day!

I started with Gusto (formerly ZenPayroll) after spending a traumatizing year at another SaaS company. When I interviewed with Gusto, I felt burnt out on what I thought was universal corporate culture. However, from the very start, it was clear to me how different this company was from any other. My interviewers were incredibly kind and respectful of my time and knowledge. I left my on-site feeling EXCITED about the mission and vision of the company. That feeling has only continued. I've now been here for about 3 months and I've not had one bad day. Or maybe I've just redefined what a bad day really is! A ""bad day"" here, is just a less-than-awesome day.

Every day, I am excited to come to work and tackle the challenges of the moment. Management encourages ownership and autonomy in everyone's work, and always upholds the company values! By week two, I was making noticeable contributions to my team because I was given the authority and support to take on projects right away. I've never been micro-managed here, and everyone across all departments are HAPPY to help you in any way they can. The people I work with are so talented, passionate and smart. i am inspired every day. My managers recognize my strengths and reinforce them daily. They also are amazing at giving me actionable, constructive feedback. i'm in an awesome period of massive professional growth and I'm loving it.

We are truly a customer-driven organization. Your priorities and projects are constantly refined to ensure that the work you do on a daily basis directly and positively affects the CX.

Most importantly, I finally feel valued at all times. My ideas are important, and heard. I feel so lucky to have found Gusto.","The only con is having some slight anxiety that something this good might be hard to maintain in a period of explosive growth.

During the interview I was told that because of my vast experience I was going to be a lead ""down the road"". I was excited and empowered to do the best work of my life knowing that it will pay off in the future.
I was asked to write a Glassdoor review the first week on the job when I was still seeing this ""career"" through rose colored glasses.
I came in early every morning and was always the last one leave. I wanted to make sure I learned as much as I could as quickly as I could. There were a lot of mistakes made prior to me taking this positon, which was understandable considering this is a start up environment. I wanted to make sure they would not happen again...
I felt my work was making a difference, only to be called into a random, unexpected meeting with HR where I was told that ""today is my last day"".
Apparently the management decided that 2 months on job - 2 MONTHS! - was enough to make a judgment on whether I will be a good lead or not. I was shocked, confused and heartbroken knowing how much time and effort I have put in. Never in my life have I experienced such cold blooded and apathetic management that would rather dispose of you on the spot than have your back and provide creative feedback.
Don't let all the perks and façade fool you. It is not about how hard you work but rather how good of ""friends"" you are with the management.

They hire inexperienced people to lead teams and treat people like they are a number. If you leave before 7pm, you will be talked about.

2015-05-06, Customer Advocate,,Current Employee ,I've never been this satisfied with my work,Less than a year,0,"I don't know where to start with how much I love working at ZenPayroll. The people I work with are awesome, and I couldn't be happier with everyone here, the departments aren't segregated, as an example when asked what someone's role is or what team they are with would often come with a response of ""Most often I work with the _____ team"" where employees are working between departments and have great communication. Even if it's not a project I still lunch with people from other departments and have amazing conversations (even if they aren't work related).

I can volunteer for projects & can work with other departments on almost a whim. When looking at this job culture fit and values were my priorities, and the idea of everyone being a builder and everyone having an ownership mentality really inspires me. I've never been happier to go to work or to be at work.

There are fancy perks (especially at the new office) There's great food and drinks and snacks aplenty, but none of that is as important as the fact that I am helping to build this company. I came in and on day one I had ideas, and there were listened to. Within the first week I had had lunch with 2 of the founders (one of the meals we were sitting on the floor, not as some Zen thing, but because it was a larger meeting and we were in the small office then).

Small business is a really cool place to be right now, and being able to empower and enable employers to have employees and to show their appreciation for those employees is really cool. I get to celebrate with a company when they have new hires, and often employers are so thankful for the help (one time I was called a wizard, made my day/week/month).

We are growing super fast, but have made it a priority to hold on to our culture (which is very important for me), and we are hiring amazing people to help continue the trend.

TL;DR ZenPayroll is the best.","I don't personally live close to the office (that's on me), we're in our new office so the biggest issue of space is solved.",Keep on doing what you're doing! Spending time with you all at lunch & dinner is great.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
