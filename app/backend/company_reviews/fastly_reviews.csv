They really need to listen to employees at the lowest level. Lots of turnover. It was a great place to work, at the start of 2017 it all went pear shaped.

Still a start-up but maturing fast
Convenient location(s)
Friendly company culture

Flexible schedule(WFH) for most teams and believes in a healthy work life balance.","Communication is probably one of the biggest internal challenges we face as an organization but I find that a constant problem with most start-ups.

We have a wide variety of personalities/people(some of the most unique and interesting i've ever worked with) and overall, people are respectful and engaging. There is still a lack of structure and knowledge due to a lack of experience on some teams but passion and drive fill in the gaps.

It's not a company that will necessarily tell you when there are issues with performance but their solution is to just quietly let the person go.

We still have some early employee's mixed in with a lot of new team members. You will see some preferential treatment but that should eventually phase out.

Diversity- apart from the mostly white male sales team, the organization seems to have industry standard diversity stats(not great but the entire tech industry has a problem). The organization is aware they need to improve and will even talk about it but little action is done.

Perks- lunch catered only on Monday and Thursday. I feel the bay area standard is free lunch provided everyday. (yes, we live in a bubble)","Continue to focus on the bigger picture but also take time to listen to your employee's and take action.

Flexibility (typical of SF/Silicon Valley tech culture)
No “bro culture.”","If you are looking for a cool startup to join, look elsewhere because Fastly is not it anymore. In particular, there is nothing cool about the Sales/Client Services org.

Salary: Most likely the equity offered will be insignificant. Also, your bonuses and accelerators can be screwed with at any time. If you want to work here, make sure you negotiate a base salary commensurate with your market value. Don't rely on anything else.

Bias: The small size of the company facilitates development of more personal relationships (as opposed to strictly professional relationships). This increases likelihood of bias in evaluation of reports of discrimination/wrongdoing when the accused is a part of the immediate circle of the person evaluating the report. There are definitely certain people who are a part of privileged circles at Fastly and can get away with unlawful behavior, at least the first time.

Culture: Typical western liberal culture. (This is not exactly a con, but it's not ideal.) Fastly does not have the cultural diversity of a global tech company.",Figure out how to keep investors happy without alienating workers.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

There is potential to become a leader in the CDN space. Medical and compensation benefits are competitive with other start ups in SF.,"This is a 7 year old ""start up"" but many of the start up problems exist within this company. Common start up complaints that many experience or see in Fastly include; preferential treatment is given to those < 50 to be hired by the company or those who are buddies or dating the C levels or VPs, misogynistic/boys club attitude, lack of diversity, no transparency or communication is received from the C level managers, middle management heavy (although most start ups have a flat hierachy), nickel and dime attitude towards expenses, and cannot retain employees.

As others have mentioned in previous reviews, the culture at this company is the worst in SF (think of the recent problems with Uber). C level managers provide no transparency and little direction leaving the middle managers (whom most have little to no experience managing others) to attempt to provide guidance for their respective teams.

Bullying and inappropriate behavior is common place, people have been fired in ways which are humiliating to the individual (even if they meet their sales quota, you could still be fired), throwing others under the bus to appear more valuable to the business is normal here (VPs and other managers exhibit this behavior, it comes from the top down) and many managers are either two -faced or confrontational when it comes to problem solving, and this is creating dysfunctional teams / teams that work in silos. The arrogance of this company is beyond belief, they act like they are the next""uber"" but are unheard of in the Bay area.","Workplace training for managers and sexual harassment training is needed to create a safe work environment for all. Training managers on how to be ""managers"".

Advice to Board of Directors - fire the bad actors who are C level, VPs and middle managers. The problems start from the top. Eradicate the bullying culture. It is obvious that the upper management does not demonstrate leadership qualities, these individuals care more about their wineries, trips to Tahoe, blaming their staff for not meeting revenue goals and sleazing onto women in the workplace.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

The team has a lot of great people that are very friendly and good at their jobs. The SDR manager is the best manager I've ever had the privilege of working with in my career.

The odds are against you if you want to be considered for a promotion based upon merit alone. You need to befriend a reputable manager who will give you their blessing and take their personal time to help train you and to champion you internally to Sales Leadership.

Fastly runs a significant amount of internet traffic every day, and because of that it's a great place to do hardcore engineering, and come up with innovative ways to speed up and protect the delivery of internet content. Other companies where you can do similar things are likely to be significantly bigger, and have more barriers to making big contributions as an individual.

What I have liked in Fastly is the responsibility each of the employees takes for the success of the company and its customers. I've worked here for close to a year, and still haven't seen much of a ""pass the buck mentality"": when someone raises a problem, colleagues will take ownership to either fix it, or find someone responsible to fix it.

Especially during time critical issues, the entire company comes together and makes sure the right things happen. Making sure customers are taken care of is something everyone sees as their responsibility.

In addition, the employees and leadership are genuinely nice people who treat each other well. While I don't see money being spent on unnecessary, frivolous benefits, Fastly spends a lot of time thinking about its culture and figuring out nice, unexpected ways of reinforcing it.","The company is at a specific phase in its growth where process is at the top of mind, and is being carefully considered and implemented, which is a stage that may not be ideal for everyone.

2015-07-01,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,The best kind of get-things-done,More than a year,0,"Every profession is valued here, rather than having a certain engineering group or sales region placed on a pedestal. Everyone's work is valued, and everyone's pretty darn good at their jobs.

The core product is killer, and no one's resting on their laurels: people are working hard to make things better every day. Despite that, there's a solid work life balance for a startup. The concept of ""long hours as a badge of honor"" is totally foreign here.

Everyone deeply cares about the growth and success of other employees. Training is highly built into the culture, and professional growth is highly encouraged -- you're not pegged into a box once you're hired.

The company is in the middle of the rapid headcount and customer growth phase, so needs change. If there's a problem you want to solve in the business, you can go for it.","Fastly's in a highly competitive market, so there's no time for great-gatsbyesque parties, lavish offsites, or the other surface level fluff that gets popularized in the media. There's fun times, and we definitely hang out with each other like friends, but you won't see Cake or OkGo playing a Fastly event, and you won't see a collection of 40yr scotches by the case.

If you want to work in a company where you can play ping pong all day, or where there's all night DJing, they exist in the bay, and there's a ton of them, but Fastly isn't the place for that. We're outperforming our competitors by working hard, and leaving at sane hours (5-6pm) to recharge and be with our friends and families.","Keep the pace, keep executing, and keep growing your people.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
2015-05-27, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Doing a great job,More than 3 years,0,"I joined Fastly as employee #20 (interviewed as #15) and have always felt that the company and its leadership was accessible, humorous, and open to new ideas. Since then, the company has grown by almost 10 times in terms of staff. The relaxed, open culture has been maintained and I've found it easy to have productive professional relationships with people across the company.

Hard work is recognized and rewarded. Management is passionate not only about the market goals but the technology innovated at the company. This permeates into different internal organizations, and it shows. Sales people are excited to sell the product. Marketing people are excited to enable people to talk about our products and services. Engineers love the hard problems that need to be solved daily. HR / office administration are all super friendly and easy to talk to.

There is a culture of nipping things in the bud before they become overly problematic. Whether talking about technical debt, problematic personal interactions, or whatever -- senior management and HR are always open and available to talk to. Furthermore, honesty is appreciated and that is shown.

Collaboration is encouraged, and for a sufficiently gregarious person, it should be easy to approach anybody at the company. I've connected with many new people here.

We have regular all hands status meetings. They are now less frequent than they were when I started, but the point is that the company is transparent with its employees about everything from exciting new projects to financials.

We have a culture of learning. Employees regularly engage in spare-time activities to further the skills of their colleagues -- activities ranging from teaching MIT OCW material to various forms of sportsball to helping others with CFPs, slides, and presentations.

Standard perks, catered lunches, dog-friendly office, yadda yadda.

I don't have a view that Fastly is a nepotism. Certainly people who have been there the longest have moved up the highest. However, this isn't true in all cases; there are effectively founding members still working on the front lines of product management. As a new employee, I was welcomed and respected; it seems this trend continues.

I don't have a view that Fastly is cliquish. I have found it easy to interact and speak with almost everybody who has made it into the office. There are a few shy folks around who I haven't spoken to much. Between mingling with various crews at our semiweekly catered lunches and our all-hands meetings where new employees are introduced, I think we do a pretty job of breaking down walls.

It's possible that all of this is my white male privilege speaking, some kind of shielding from the BS of normal company flow I might experience from having a ""coveted"" engineering position, or a combination of the two. (I've kind of gotten the idea that people think engineers are treated specially in the Bay Area.) This may be true, but I don't know about it.","Every positive review is looked at skeptically, especially in the presence of any negative review(s). (Though I'd argue any review should be looked at skeptically, regardless of its tone. This is the Internet. Glassdoor didn't even try to perform any validation that I am, in fact, a current employee.) There are negative aspects to working at Fastly that I have experienced, so hopefully that will inspire some confidence in my review.

It can be easy to overwork yourself at Fastly. Being excited about the product combined with the sheer volume of work there is to do to get the company to really succeed in the market can drive a workaholic to tears. I hear that things are actually changing to address this issue, but until something formal comes out, I think it remains a valid concern.

Compensation and benefits could be better for a company of this size. And while I've seen many people move around, having new roles carved for them, I've also seen many stagnate. Again, there's been talk about making career advancement happen without moving up the management ladder, but until that happens, it remains a concern.

I worked as a remote employee for the first year-and-a-half of my employment. This was difficult for a number of reasons, but I did feel like without being in the office, I was being left behind. I have moved to the Bay Area to work at the office and that largely ameliorated my concerns. I can understand how a remote person could find working for Fastly difficult. I don't know what the remote experience is like, though I know we retain several remote people across organizations. I'd encourage the company to continue to try to support those people to the best of their ability.

To that respect, working as a remote employee can be difficult here, and I wouldn't really recommend it.

While I don't think Fastly is cliquish, I can see how people could think that. While I think some of that can be solved by simply approaching more people, I also don't want to blame the victim. I would encourage Fastly employees to be more gregarious and inclusive in general.","Keep doing what you're doing. I find management open, honest, and approachable. It seems that negative feedback is taken very seriously. Keep us updated on progress of the rollout of some of these ideas to combat some of the negative feelings / experience.

It's probably obvious who I am from writing style and verbosity. Feel free to ping me anytime to talk about company health.",5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
