2019-02-25,,"Lehi, UT",Current Employee ,"Lots of potential, positive culture, great people, very chaotic",Less than a year,0,"--The people: I've been with Womply for around a year, and I love the people I work with.
--Work-life balance: from what I've seen, the company sticks to their word and encourages you to ""unplug"" when you're not at work and take vacation days to recharge. The management I report to does seem to work long/hard but they are under a lot of pressure to produce results and grow, as you can imagine in a startup with 8 years under its belt. If you function best with a strict 8 or 9-hour workday, be sure to talk about that with the recruiter and/or your interviewer to make sure the expectations are understood by all parties, and then hold them to that when you get hired.
--Casual dress code, relaxed atmosphere. I despise formal/stuffy business attire and this is a huge plus for me. (see below for downsides of casual/open office environment). If you are deeply offended by C level management wearing t-shirts/jeans/shorts/hoodies, look elsewhere for employment. You are certainly free to wear whatever formal business attire you wish.
--Huge opportunity/potential for growth/chance to make a real difference. The benefit to small businesses who use the product is real and substantial. The ""startup culture"" and the resulting chaos (see ""cons"" below) means that if you're a self-starter and you see something that needs to be done, chances are nobody else is doing it or has seen the need for it, and you can spearhead some really significant initiatives, make a real difference, and get the credit you deserve.
--The product provides real value. The data assets are huge and business owners. The concept is is a winner and has the potential to change the world for local businesses.
--You will get credit/kudos/recognition for the work you do and the difference you make. Management is very open and free with praise and everyone is eager to share or even defer the credit for goals met and key projects completed. Nobody beats their chest and says it's all about me.
--Freeloaders can snack/eat/drink soda for free all day long. Frequent food brought in for the office.
--Company seems to be getting its feet under it and is in position to get it right and grow huge.
--Decent money, good benefits.","--Chaos. ""Startup culture"" can mean a lot of things, but here it means ""oh crap we never thought of that we better fix it."" The last year has been rough, as you can see from the reviews about huge sales staff turnover and people leaving. In my personal view, the people who have been let go were honestly not performing up to expectations or producing significant, measurable results. And naturally you can expect them to be bitter in some cases. But I would also encourage you to take the ultra-negative comments with a grain of salt. Not many people will write a glowing review after being fired. And honestly, if you're not meeting the expectations you were hired to meet, shouldn't you expect repercussions? But yeah, if you crave a drama-free, opportunity-free, worker-bee job where you just punch the clock and do your time, look elsewhere. At Womply you will be challenged, and the challenges are enormous and can feel insurmountable at times.
--The ""open plan office"" is murder for people who prefer things quiet to maximise their productivity. Seriously whoever came up with this dumb-arse idea needs to be broken on the rack. So if you don't thrive with terrible pop music constantly on in the background and/or if you're distracted by other people's conversations/clicking pens/sociopathic whistling/loud chewing/flatulence/passive-aggressive typing/inane blather/whatever, invest in some quality noise-canceling headphones, or apply elsewhere.
--Working remotely is discouraged. They do allow it but they expect it to be the rare exception, and from what I've seen it's usually when people are sick that they work from home. Management does want people on site whenever possible (and due to the ""focus on results"" company value and the and ""rise and grind"" mentality of some people, lots of people come in sick). So if you work best from a home office, look elsewhere or be sure to get whatever WFH arrangement you get them to agree to in writing so there are no surprises.","--Reconsider the open office plan
--Continue emphasizing/exemplifying core company values and a healthy work-life balance
--""Have fun"" company value needs to actually mean something
--Sales processes that should have been in place 8 years ago need to be in place.
--Dedicate enough people/bandwidth to truly fix problems rather than just applying temporary band-aid solutions.
--Have a longer/foundational view of growing the business. (This is improving)",4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

If you read them you'll see that there are never any specifics.

The main thing people buy is our get reviews product. But I don't know of any customers that actually get reviews with our software. I heard the review rate is less than 1% and I believe it. I have alot of customers that have never gotten a review after paying us over $100 a month and signing a 12 month contract. Our system isnt automated like we say it is. We have customer service reps who take our customers google or yelp usernames and passwords and login as the customer. I don't know how they let us get away with that because it seems wrong. I don't think our customers know. If a customer changes their username or password then our customer service team can't do anything for them. It just stops working.

Tricking customer into thinking they are using another companies system into buying Womply SAAS products is just not for the ethical salesmen.

Womply will eventually go under once consumers catch on to what's going on.

2019-02-28,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Unbiased review; just keepin' it real,More than a year,0,"- Met some cool coworkers. I think part of the reason we bonded so well is because we were all so miserable together at work.
- Learned new things, at least in the beginning","- TL;DR I would not recommend working here unless you absolutely have no other option and can filter out all the negativity that engulfs every aspect of this company.
- Compensation: Salary is well below industry average. Bonus is tied to company target, which means you'll probably get screwed. Equity is a joke. Leadership won't disclose the number of outstanding shares, equity % or valuation because they don't want people to know your options' true worth-- zero. Don't count on annual raises and cost of living adjustments. You're actually taking a pay cut each year because your costs are increasing while your salary stays stagnant.
- Career development: None whatsoever. There is no emphasis or resource spent on training and learning. You are there to do your job, not learn new skills that would make you more valuable elsewhere. Only a few get promoted per year (outside of sales), and even then it's just title and a small salary bump. You will however be taking on extra responsibilities from the constant deluge of coworkers leaving. More work, same pay, no thanks.
- Speaking of turnover: Many quit or get fired within the first year of employment. Hire fast, fire fast mentality. Leadership thinks this is normal and average for the industry. It's even worse and more obvious for VPs and department heads, where execs last an average of 6 months. It doesn't matter if they hire the best of the best-- they will not last long enough for their ideas and leadership to gain any traction. This is definitely the norm (for dysfunctional and failing companies).
- Culture: I've read a lot about toxic workplaces, and this company checks all the boxes. There's always talk about how things will get better, but that's all it is-- talk. Those newly in charge of improving culture and workplace experience eventually leave, starting the cycle all over again. Employee satisfaction surveys show very low engagement. Leadership's solution is to purge unhappy employees, then hire fresh recruits that are unaware of what's happening. The honeymoon period lasts about 2 months before new hires realize how dire the situation is.
- Benefits: Your get the standard medical, vision, dental, 401k without match, junk food and soda. Lunch is provided once a week. Nothing extra.
- Time off / WFH / WLB: Highly dependent on team and manager. Flexible PTO is designed to save on costs, not benefit the employee. If you take less than the standard 3-4 weeks, company wins. If you take more than 3-4 weeks, your vacation is denied. WFH is strongly discouraged but some people seem to do it half the week. Some teams work the typical 9-5 / 40 hours a week, or less, while some managers expect you to be available nights / weekends, at their beck and call. But those managers are just the messengers because the leaders call all the shots.
- Leadership (namely founder and president): They are the smartest and hardest working guys in the room. To their credit, they built a company that employs hundreds. They'd do it all by themselves without anyone else, if they could only clone themselves. Everyone else is just a replaceable cog, a necessary evil, a short term fix. Employees are told what to do, micromanaged, berated for errors, blamed for failures. They're in total denial regarding disgruntled employees, angry customers, and unhappy partners.
- Product: Kind of cool at first, but the core product provides little benefit to most. A small subset will find it useful and worth the cost. But make no mistake-- this is NOT a product-first company. Nobody has any idea how many paying customers actually use the product, and nobody seems to care. Customer engagement is kind of a running joke. An SF-based, big data tech company that sells itself on its trillions of data points and AI- and ML-driven insights doesn't have simple customer engagement data? Over half the org is made up of sales, sales support, marketing, growth. Very few work on the actual product itself. In contrast, there are some very successful companies with a great product and 0 sales. There is no product research, not even simply asking small businesses what they find useful and really need.
- Core values: They're a joke because nobody follows them even though they're posted all over the walls. In fact, they seemingly do the exact opposite of what the core values state. If I were to rewrite them, the main core value would be make money by any means necessary. Second core value would be do the wrong thing until you get caught, then cover it up and deny any knowledge. Third, blame others for anything that goes wrong.
- Ethics: While nothing this company does is outright illegal, their tactics are highly unethical and immoral. They will rarely straight up lie, but they are very careful with word choice. It's meant to mislead and deceive. This can be seen from management's Glassdoor responses to the sales script. They also withhold information, embellish facts and twist data to prove their agenda. They have no issues with charging unknowing, hard-working small businesses while providing zero value. Most ""paying"" customers were auto-enrolled and don't even know they're paying. These are the same small businesses they claim they're trying to help thrive.
- Glassdoor reviews: The reviews are polarized, an inverted bell curve. People either seem to love it or hate it, not much in between. The truth: new employees are encouraged to leave a review, and many of those are 5 stars because there's not much to complain about in the first week. Many of those reviews read ""Pros: free soda, great product, awesome sales managers // Cons: none, but if i have to name one, the traffic sucks"". Many of the 1 star reviews are written by very bitter former employees, of which there are many. In addition, there is a concerted effort by management to cover up poor ratings on other review sites too. BTW, none of the bad reviews are written by ex-employees who were fired. They threaten to sue you if you do. If those who were fired had a voice to express themselves without fear of retribution, the average rating would be much worse.","- Watch the fyre festival documentary and try to learn something from their mistakes. I see a lot of similarities.
- Instead of covering up negative Glassdoor reviews, fix the root of the problem and make Womply a better place to work. Hey, now there's a novel idea!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

2019-02-28,,"Lehi, UT",Former Employee ,I'd like a FULL refund.,More than a year,0,"If Costco snacks and taking as many opportunities to ""refill"" your soda throughout the day is your idea of a healthy work environment.... you might be a Womply Wombat!
The only real pro I can think of was working with some great people. That is pretty fleeting though since nobody really lasts longer than 6 months once they figure things out.","There is a revolving door of upper management. Let me paint you a picture. Great new senior leadership comes in, finds out what the company is really about, tries to fix things, runs into the President/Founder, leaves. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

It's truly sad that being one of the longer tenured employees usually means one of two things. 1. You are being significantly overpaid and there is no way on God's green earth you would make the same somewhere else. 2. You are lazy and haven't gotten around to updating your resume.

Work life balance means you give all of your time over to Womply. It's odd being in a place where you feel like you can't leave at 5:30 cause you have to walk by the CEO and he might question your work ethic. Don't even think about taking vacation unless you have your phone and laptop with you. ""Flexible"" PTO really means, ""Be flexible with us cause we are gonna bother you every day. ""

The product targets small businesses with a free trial in hopes that they will forget to cancel before the free trial is up. That's assuming you weren't auto-enrolled and have no idea that you are paying for it(Psst!...It's hidden in your credit card processing statement). They have a Customer Success department that is so ham-stringed that they can't even call people for fear that they will cancel.

There is no transparency at this company, likely you know more about the Trump/Russia investigation than you do about how the company is doing(and lets face it, you don't know anything about Trump/Russia). Getting blindsided with a small portion of your bonus cause the company goal ""shot for the stars"" and ended up somewhere over by the covered parking (sorry that's a pro) can help you set a new years resolution! Find a new job!

The five star reviews for this company are from brand new employees who left a review in the first week/month, and employees who left their review in their early days and have since left Womply and just don't want to look back for fear of turning into a pillar of salt. Just try and find a good review from someone that's been there over a year, I triple dog dare you.

If you need to check some boxes on your resume it might be worth a brief stint in the oven. Otherwise there are lots of companies out there that offer so much more.","Be transparent and honest with your employees and customers.

2019-02-27, Partnerships,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,INVEST ELSEWHERE!,Less than a year,0,none that I can think of.,"If you’re considering putting time or money into Womply, I strongly advise you to think again. The company has zero chance of scaling because the products don't add value for small business owners, and the leadership is totally corrupt.

Unfortunately, Womply's products are designed to make money for large PE-owned credit card processors (partners), not to solve problems for SMBs (merchants). The vast majority of Womply's merchant ""customers"" don't even know they're paying for the products (ask to see engagement metrics!) and those who do try everything they can to cancel (ask to see loyalty data!).

The whole thing's a total scam run by two truly awful leaders: the founder who is a convicted felon (look it up!), and the COO who is an ego-driven non-talent. Neither has any experience in tech or small business, and both are controlling micro-managers. Turn-over on the leadership team is 100% annually (reach out to former execs!), because no one stays around once they understand the deal.

To top it off, Womply business practices are unethical. Here’s a short list of troubling things I witnessed during my tenure:

- routinely misrepresenting dealflow to investors and the board
- overbilling partners based on false sales data
- deliberately not allowing auto-enrolled merchants to opt out of their “free trial”
- presenting fabricated product use and engagement statistics to current and prospective partners
- lying to employees about executive departures

Oh, please!!! That has to be the biggest lie I ever heard with regards to Womply...and Womply is built on lies.

There is a reason there is “new leadership” every 6 months, it’s because the previous leadership can’t handle the lies and deceit. You cannot build a sustainable company on taking advantage of customers.

It’ll only be a matter of time until Womply comes into legal trouble and the founder goes BACK to prison.

ANYONE thinking about a career at Womply, I strongly suggest looking at the 1-star reviews. They are on-point and tell it like it is.","There is absolutely no point because the founder and president are so fixated on themselves, they couldn’t care less to improve something.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The founder was convicted for Insider trading (Civil Action No. CV11-6597-DSF)

I've NEVER seen a company with LESS integrity. From the leaders to the product nothing here is as advertised.

You aren't valued. You are a piece of property to the company and expected to do whatever asked. I (much like everyone else) was personally held accountable and asked to do things outside the scope I was comfortable with or hired for.

They can't maintain any leadership. VP's are constantly in and out the door. During my time at Womply, 6 VP's were hired and quit the longest lasted about 8 months. More have left since.

The only people who stay at Womply are purchased. If they NEED you they will offer you a TON of money to stay, though be warned, a good chunk of that money will likely be tied to a bonus that is paid out on company performance. Which to Womply means they can set unrealistic goals, and pay out fractions of bonuses because they were not hit.

Work life balance means get to work at 8, work until 6/7. Go home, eat be with your family and then work more from home until bed. Had a conversation with the CEO while there stating that if I didn't want to work 60+ hours a week, I'm not ""Startup material"".

I was a valued employee when I departed Womply. Womply did try to save me by offering money, bonus, and equity. When I declined, I was belittled by the CEO. Kind of a sore loser mentality.

There are a lot of negative reviews on Glassdoor. Read them and take heed. There are also a lot of positive reviews. Please pay attention to the tenure of the review, and their current employee status. You'll find that the bulk of the ""positive"" reviews are left by employees currently working there but under 1 year. Womply ""Encourages"" (requires) employees to leave a review during their new hire process. If you did an analysis of reviews left by employees who are over 1 year vs under 1 year you'd see a very different story.

You've been warned. If you love being used, working in a toxic environment, enjoy jobs with high turnover, love being talked down to, work 24/7, worthless equity, find another new job in 6-12 months, receive lackluster bonus payouts, and drink free soda. Then you must have the ""Startup Mentality"" that I didn't. (please know I went to another startup and I am thriving).

I can assure you that no one there, unless they’re brand new, is truly excited about how the company is performing and the mass exodus of people leaving.

Their only form of revenue is currently coming from businesses that don’t know they’re paying for the software, since it’s charged on their ccard processing statement. They were either bulldozed into a free trial that they never cancelled or were auto enrolled by their processor.
They have a tiny number of annual or monthly customers signing up.

Don’t believe any BS from a recruiter or upper management. Things are definitely not going well.

New managers have left great companies to come over after being sold, only to realize it’s a total disaster.

They hire people from all walks of life and don't adhere to the typical ""culture fit"" criteria that one hears among many loud Silicon Valley voices. After an 8 year career in finance, no tech firm would hire me because of my lack of experience selling SaaS, however Womply sure did. I took advantage of this opportunity and became the most successful SDR there. They noticed my efforts and offered me the opportunity to hire and train their first class of SDRs at their new location. I was then promoted to an Account Executive role where I ranked 1st or 2nd in the company most of the time.

As an account executive, middle management noticed that I sold a particular feature of the flagship product very well. They then gave me the opportunity to hold a series of seminars teaching the other sales representatives how to sell this particular feature.

Look at me now; I’m the CEO of a successful startup. I sincerely thank Toby and Cory for instilling a culture at Womply that embraces diversity. Had it not been for them, I may not be where I am today.

Much love!","The sales model may have changed since I was employed by the company, but from my experience the primary con is that the sales roles at Womply are not a good fit for everyone.

They condescend others, do not encourage, coach, listen to calls, meet with employees individually or do anything but walk around all day; many employees were concerned about what were are actually getting paid to do. Anyone with an education and experience are left with little or no growth potential unless you act like upper management is royalty. The boost product itself is pretty worthless and does not sell.

Medical, dental etc. Free soda machines and decent amount of snacks","Oh the irony of leaving a review for a company that manages reviews for other companies.

I know. You’re thinking, “wow $40,000? And literally no experience required? Sign me up!” Not so fast. Do you remember when your mom would tell you “if it’s too good to be true it probably is”? That’s this job. Marc will give you a call shortly after you apply (I’ll explain later). He’ll talk about how some reps are on pace for 6 figures. They might be, but not in Boost. I can’t speak for Core. You’ll think to yourself, wow this sounds like a good opportunity. He’ll talk about the expected growth as Womply is in a start up phase. I don’t know if you could count a business that’s been in business for eight years to be in a start up phase.

You’ll have a group interview and then a private interview. Then they’ll tell you you basically have the job. You might think “that’s weird, that was a little too easy”. It was. It’s because they’re desperate.

You’ll spend a few days with a lady named Sofia. She’s the rah rah person for Womply. She’ll get you fired up and excited about the position. She’s good at her job. The product itself is a good product. It makes sense. You’ll think to yourself “this will be a piece of cake” and “I probably can make $10,000 in commission”. It’s not and you won’t.

You’ll get up to the floor and have your first few calls on the phone. It’ll be weird if you’ve never done it and sure you’ll get used to it. You’ll start to get the hang of things but still won’t know what you’re doing. This is the issue with Womply. There’s literally no training. Do you want to improve your skills and actually become good at this job? Figure it out yourself. Outside of the training from the first week, don’t plan on getting any pointers. I’ve never been a manager before so take this with a grain of salt but how about some actual training in here? Who knows what the managers are doing all day because it’s definitely not developing SDRs. Would it be that hard to have a one hour training like even twice a week for newer people? Meanwhile they keep upping the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) thinking “if we raise the standard everyone will do it”. News flash 80% (not an exaggeration) of SDRs aren’t even hitting the old KPI so why would you bump it up?

Here’s the best part, the closers or the Account Executives. They get warm leads (someone who is interested) all day, get paid more ($20/hr) and get more commission (usually the first month of whatever they close at) and do less work! Also when numbers are down, SDRs are told to “get to work” and “have a big day”. The biggest issue is the close rate. Only about 10% of transfers (warm leads you send to an AE) end up closing. What happens to the other 90%? They get lost, some genuinely aren’t interested but majority of them are just busy. AE’s have no incentive to continually follow up, why would they when they get a new person on the phone who is interested? A big problem is getting the decision maker on the phone, putting them on hold for a minute because all the AE’s have their headphones off and are hanging out with each other. Sometimes the decision makers are on the fence and let me tell you, putting them on hold for a minute to “talk to your manager” is not helping your odds. Also all the leads are shared. Meaning there’s 10,000 leads in the dialer and it’s first come first served. One of the most frustrating parts is when you call someone who was called earlier this morning because the person who called it first was too lazy to put some notes or disposition it to be call even tomorrow. Simply put this shouldn’t even be an issue and could honestly be solved with a single training. You’re going in blind because your other SDRs are too lazy to actually develop leads and just throw them back into the queue However, if you’re an AE this is a pretty cushy job.

After a few weeks it’ll be clear (they hire 10-12 people a week EVERY WEEK) that you either figure it out yourself (kudos to those 15% people) or they just get on you about getting your numbers up all the time. They don’t provide any structure or training or really any commission ($10K at $6-$10/transfer so 83 transfers in a month which is unheard of two or three might do 50 in a month). This is the most inefficiently run organization I’ve ever seen. Managers don’t actually do anything to help you in your position. If you take this job, understand that you won’t receive any training or really any attention.

Only take this job if you are truly desperate because I believe some income is better than no income. In the meantime continue searching for another job.",Why is there no training for SDRs? What makes you think that hiring 12 people a week is a good thing (and don't say growth because just as many quit as you hire every week)? What do managers actually do?

2018-08-31, Senior Account Executive,,Current Employee ,Does not get any worse than Womply,More than a year,0,The ping pong table that everyone uses to escape the job they all hate,"The hardest part about leaving a review on Womply is knowing which of all the terrible things should you put on here. But let's give it a hack.

There was a previous review on here where someone claimed that Womply tells the new hires to leave a positive glassdoor review upon onboarding. This is ABSOLUTELY true. They responded to that negative review to cover their dishonest practice but I have been with this company for a long time and this happens every hire class. (Which is every two weeks and they still can't keep up with their employee churn.)

So many lies with Womply. For starters let's look at their Glassdoor page. It says Cory Capoccia is their CEO. Lie. It is Toby Scammell (who went to prison for insider trading). The problem was his CEO approval rating was awful because people were exposing him for the CEO he truly is. He once added a ""Core Value"" of ""Embrace Diversity"" only to become the biggest offender of the value. He can constantly be heard making fun of the LDS church. He does not care about his employees, as evidence shows with his senior management churn. 8 different senior managers across a variety of functions left after only lasting about 6 months or less.

There has only been one to last longer than 6 months, only because his is the only ego around to rival that of Toby's. He actually has a sign on his door essentially stating, in the most obnoxious way, that his time is more valuable than yours, so don't bother him. He sits in his office all day refusing to interact with anyone and working on either one of two things: his weekly commission plan change or a new sappy LinkedIn post. His LinkedIn profile is his favorite thing about himself. If for some reason he has to come out of his office, he puts in his airpods and hastily walks through the office pretending to be on some important phone call so nobody will say hi to him. Heaven forbid he actually has to talk to one of his employees. He epitomizes the term ""good ole boys"". The only job security you have with this guy is if you can play a decent round of golf with him, or make obscene jokes about other employees behind their backs.

This company is full of unqualified individuals leading the sales team. One of them who has never had another sales job outside of Womply but thinks he knows everything there is to know about sales and dictates as such. There is no conversation with this guy, outside of yes sir. You cannot collaborate on ideas and if you try, it is seen as insubordination and you could very well be on the outs.

They lie to prospective employees saying they can make up to 200k a year. That could not be any further from the truth. The best salesperson there is on pace for about 85k and he is an anomaly. Most that make it past 3 month (which are very few) only make about 40k.

They don't technically lie to prospective clients but they do deceive them as much as they can. With careful wording they make it seem like they are their credit card processor reaching out in customer service manner, only to turn it into a sales call. This obviously infuriates these business owners. If they do happen to get someone to buy the product, they don't actually buy into the software but into a free trial that Womply hopes they forget about. Nobody actually uses the malfunctional software, they just forget to cancel the trial and get billed for it every month through their processor.

The other deceitful thing they do is what they call ""auto-enroll"" but then changed to the enrollment team. This was supposed to help with the shady practices's image. They charge customers through the credit card processor for the product without ever getting their permission.

Womply is largely dependent on the partnerships they have with the credit card processors. That relationship is deteriorating rapidly. Womply is inducing churn and upsetting the processor's client base and as a result they have stopped sending them leads. Because of this they went from doing around 150 sales a day to doing about 30.

Do not work for this company. They will lie, deceive and do anything they can to try and get you to come onboard, only to push you out the door three months later. Turn and run from the worst company in the valley.",They wouldn't take any advice.

During the interview I was told I would go from $13-$15 an hour after being promoted from SDR to AE. Never happened and they switched the comp plan during this time “for the better” that was bad timing for my class and most have left. They are constantly “working on it”.

 Top reps make 80-100k False, Top reps make 50k no one has made even 80k thus far. 1 person might make 6 figures in 2018 but he will beat everyone by 30-40k. If they do not change the base pay they will never get the reps with the most potential to stay and it will be just another call floor in no time. The cubicles are trash. They are not transparent with the sales reps when things are not going so well.(leads, letting people go, etc) sink or swim mentality here with the worst coaching I have seen in a long time. AE is a fancy title for sales rep. People have been dropping like flies and the morale has been down 50% since November. There is usually a problem when management drives $50,000 cars and the employees can barely pay for gas in their $2,000 car. They are “working on making things better” but it is costing the sales reps time and money in the meantime. They only care about numbers and it is starting to show. It is a start up and that is what I have to keep telling myself.","If you want more quality sales reps than you are going to have to INVEST more money quality people. Do a market analysis on what real SDR’s and AE’s make.
88% of sales reps won’t wait 3 months for a possible raise especially with how volatile the leads are. Just be transparent with the sales reps. They will respect you more. Train people that struggle better. The coaching is bad. Your not the only ones with families so pay people what they are worth. Loyal and positive people are hard to come by.

Employees are expected to be ""seat-warmers,"" working an average of 55-60 hours per week. Don't believe me? Check their website's ""How We Work"" page, its right there. Care about work-life balance? Forget about it once you sign up to work here. And hope you don't mind the occasional condescending email you'll receive (just as you are winding down and getting ready for bed) from top management. They simply don't care about you or your quality of life outside of work.

Speaking about management: there is an immense amount of micromanagement coming from the top down. They like to keep video cameras and live stream on at all times, including business hours, so they can ""keep tabs"" on all employees. Invasive much?

This spring/early summer, a handful of executives were hired, all in very key roles from Engineering, Legal, and HR. In the last two months, they have all left the company, either resigned or let go. In addition, a couple of Engineering managers from various teams have resigned. Leaves one to wonder why the mass exodus?

Bottom line: Womply is a toxic workplace and does not care about their employees. If you have other options, weigh them heavily against Womply. If you are a decent, hardworking, and ethical human being, don't make the mistake of taking a job here. This company will use and abuse you.",Why bother?,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,
2017-10-12,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Decent people to work with; poor management,,0,Some great people to work with in Engineering. It keeps paying the bills.,"There were several things wrong with that place. Majority of the positive reviews posted here seems from other office (Sales) which may be forced as part of hiring process. The negative reviews are spot on.

- The direction and vision is lacking completely and projects can be decided based on a whim; whatever the owner decides for the next few months, based on some information that he gathered
- Team leaders are not trusted on their assigned responsibilities and not thought of as doing a good job and always seem to be in meetings with owner clarifying why something was done a certain way
- Upper management is too involved in lower level processes basically micro-management is being done. They have several tools for tracking work and employees are required to show their individual/team progress which are useless other than providing a way to management to question
- The office is never in full attendance indicating someone is Working-From-Home every now and then but this is kept hush hush within teams because the management is scared it will start a trend. They strictly oppose and forbid it yet a chosen few always seems to be getting away with it. They started asking employees to put work-from-home hours in their PTO tracking system.....which is not time off to begin with, all to further micro manage some folks.
- Owner lacks honest care for employees
- Expectation of working long hours is there, if there is not enough work to justify, seat warming is expected. Favoritism plays a role here too.
- Not very collaborative or healthy environment rather a breeding ground for bully culture and employees who show this tendency are well regarded.
- Employee retention is non existent employees leave very soon, very few long term employees",Start to care for you employees they are assets and not just a means to an end.,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Pretty fair with having to take time off.,"To start it off the CEO has been to federal prison for insider trading. He is a sleezy guy and Womply try to hide that as best as they absolute can. They never say a word about it and don't want people knowing. Type his name into google and lots will come up about it though.

This company is very poorly run. They got a big investor to give them a bunch of money under the terms that everyone goes through a background check. They had to fire so many people due to this for drug usage that they stopped testing for it. People where getting high on there breaks or coming to work high all the time. Management pretended to not notice but it was obviously happening.

The VP of sales is a good guy who works hard I think his name is Mark Smith. Everyone else is terrible. A lot of the company has grown organically so many of the people have no experience in sales outside of Womply. They love love love to micromanage. They throw out spiffs here and there but its not worth how hard you work.

Pay is terrible. Most SDR positions are making 36K plus a year before commission. Your lucky to make 32K here with commission. They will lie and tell you there account executives make bank but the best of the best said they where only making maybe 40K or 50K a year which is terrible for account executives.

They lie and lie and lie and lie. They did not pay many people there commission checks and they keep saying things are going to change but they never do. They also ""rolled"" out PTO recently but its garbage. They where not doing paid holidays or anything when I was there. They blame all there problems on being a start up but they have been around for about 5 or 6 years. They have a revenue of almost 50 million a year, I'm pretty sure they can afford things like paid holidays and PTO.

They don't know where there going to be in a few months. There relocating yet again and you can never know where they will relocate to.

High turnover rate for a reason. Almost everyone who comes in working here comes in with a positive attitute thinking its like most sales jobs where even as an SDR you are making decent money. Thats not the case. Neither there SDR's or there AE's make a lot of money. Managment micromanages and they all have little to no sales experience except for a few who have a little and really think they are somebody. Mark Smith is trying and working hard and Chris Hartman also tries and cares even though he has little experience in sales. Other than that everything was terrible.

That and maybe the free snacks, lunch on Fridays, happy hours, and sheer laziness/comfort. During my time at Womply, I met many smart, talented, driven, honest, and caring individuals that I still keep in touch with today. If you need to add another notch on your resume, Womply is the place for you. Do as you’re told, never question the authority (esp if it involves being ethical), and just be a “yes wo/man” and Womply can be a good stepping stone to gain some experience for the next job.","During my first 2-3 months at the company, at least 6 people quit. They didn’t get fired, they QUIT. That’s more than the amount of people that quit in a year at my job prior. I don’t care what anyone says, that’s a red flag. It’s sad, but people easily see through the smoke and mirrors soon after they’re hired and quit in less than a year.

When people continue to drop like flies for the same reasons you would think that management would take a look at themselves to see if there is anything they can do differently, but apparently they’re never at fault. That’s what happens when you are considered Employee #X instead of an actual person. You will be taken advantage of, you will be talked down to, and you will always be replaceable. Just ask any member of the SF sales team. And if you’re lucky, they will look for your replacement while you are still employed without giving you so much as a warning to improve.

I hear they have a VP of People now (something that was long overdue), so I can only hope he/she is making positive changes for the sake of future employees and the longevity of the company.",Why bother? They won’t listen to you anyway.,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

2017-06-21,,"Lehi, UT",Current Employee ,"Decent culture/benefits, baffling management team",Less than a year,0,"It's important to note that the experience an hourly employee will have at Womply is very different from the experience a salaried employee will have. Here are my observations:

Hourly:
- Free snacks
- Awesome break room with ping-pong, foosball, etc.
- Comfortable work environment (casual dress, music on the sales floor, etc.)
- Personable and friendly sales managers

Salaried:
- Generous vacation policy (extra time off around the holidays, etc.)
- Bright co-workers and interesting work.
- Good camaraderie among co-workers.
- Reasonable work/life balance (most of the time).
- Excitement of working for a Bay Area tech start-up.
- Lots of opportunities to contribute and get noticed.","Hourly:
- Lots of clawbacks; customers are given a 30-day free trial and often cancel.
- Poor job security. Womply periodically terminates under-performing reps.
- Sub-par equipment (cheap laptops, headphones, etc.)

Salaried:
- Ethical conflicts. Womply relies heavily on customers who don't even know they're paying for the product.
- Condescending and confusing direction from senior management.
- Mediocre benefits (no 401k match, etc.).","Strongly consider the following excerpts from Glassdoor reviews:

""The CEO is push and abrasive. Sends condescending emails and messages and then nice to your face.""

""CEO is about as friendly as a honey badger.""

My experience with the CEO is that he's extremely brilliant and driven, and is very friendly to employees... when he's talking with them face-to-face. Most communication via e-mail, calls, etc. is uncommonly harsh, demanding, and condescending. Employees are routinely told their work is ""insufficient"", or that they were asked for a deliverable weeks earlier when nobody but the CEO has any memory of it. Employees quickly become accustomed to rarely being thanked for their hard work or being told they've done a good job.

Condescending, demanding requests may stoke egos, but they are toxic to a company's culture. Such requests quickly lead to employees losing respect for senior management and even poking fun at them when they're not around. As senior managers at the company, you'll have to make a serious decision regarding what's most important to you: your ego or your company's culture.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

Lots of recent leadership hires (all external).","I turned in my notice on the day of my six month anniversary.

Short version: Unrealistic expectations, poor communication, toxic culture, no evidence of promotions or raises among longer tenured team members, and a generally unpleasant feeling the more I learned about the inner workings made the brief time feel like so much longer.

Long version: My role changed significantly between interview and start date, which I thought odd but accepted as part of a rapidly changing environment. It turned out to be a prolonged and unnecessary ambiguity due to poor communication both between my manager and me and with the company at large... compounded by the fact that when I joined there was no org chart or commonly known team structure. When there were questions that crossed team lines, it was either go all the way to the top or play a guessing game in the middle.

The ""honeymoon"" phase was totally gone in two weeks and I thought I would be fired in under six - both due largely to poor communication with my manager, the founder. Several (5+) others admitted they felt like they could be fired at any time.

When I brought up cultural issues - basically that at least a few of the stated values were commonly viewed as hollow - I was told that was a surprise... and to focus on specifically assigned tasks, not ""drift"" into self-guided distractions. This was particularly disconcerting since a large part of our interview conversation was about improving company morale to reduce employee attrition, all in an effort to improve productivity and reduce customer attrition in the long run. That's what I thought I was doing...

In my brief time there, it became obvious that the leadership valued skillsets instead of people. Skillsets, in turn, were treated as interchangeable... leading to unilateral shifts in the org without input from team leads or affected individuals (for example, I found out I no longer reported to the founder from someone else that was not my new manager or in HR), revolving door hire fast/ fire fast practices, and generally ignoring the human element of any equation, whether it related to engineering, marketing, sales or other operations. Raises and promotions seem impossible to come by.

Every leader I saw installed was an outside hire. Hopefully they have enough latitude to enact significant cultural change.","Be honest with yourselves about why you are in business and then let that guide how you do business.

More noteworthy is how he reacted to getting caught. He's a former Bain consultant, which is not a historical footnote: he's still very much drinking the Kool-Aid, citing their philosophies and giving material to his managers to read. That's worth taking into consideration if you're in engineering or on the creative side of things. He is obsessed with making employees work long hours, and resents having to pay engineers high salaries.

This is not your typical ""techie startup."" It's built around a pretty shady industry.

This creates a toxic work environment, with a bully culture: people who are not nice can get promoted and people who care about their jobs and coworkers, demoralized. Many quit, many get fired for random reasons. If your manager can shield you, that means you may be able to do your job successfully... as long as they don't get fed up and leave.

The people who are most successful at Womply are the ones that work hard, keep their heads down and their mouths shut. There is no real office culture to speak of, this is not a fun place to work.

-NOOO benefits or paid time off for sales team
-It is not sales, its telemarketing
-Scamming poor SMB business owners to sign up for this and hoping they forget about the free trial and just continue to pay for the service
-The company operates off of barely legal loopholes.
-Pay is min. wage of $12.25 an hour for only the hours you work or show up. The ""commission"" is about an extra $100-200 (if your good) a week after taxes. you will most likely go broke working here. (must clock in and out)
-There is zero room for growth. The sales team is essentially the company's joke and are treated like second class citizens. NO respect for sales and the sales team is the one making sure management gets paid their 6 figures, equity, and benefits.
-Extremely passive aggressive managers
-Will be yelled at for having your phone on the desk
-Need a doctors note if you are sick or gone for the day under any circumstance.
-Not an A team of a sales group except for a select maybe 5-7 out of 40
-Can't find out what the company does online on purpose nor their investors or amount raised (sketch especially since lots of startups reputations are built on who the investors are and how much raised)
-Team leaders are weird and not leaders.
-Atmosphere was Frat like.

Overall if you want to work in a place where you are expendable, disrespected, and a nobody than this is your place.

The extreme turnover is their sales team plan. People come for 3 days and just stop showing up. They hire like crazy because people are constantly leaving, but that is their game plan. When you question management about this they giggle.

To sales team- you realize if this company exits you will be left with nothing while all the engineers, ops, and management is going to be sitting pretty thanks to all your work.","Pay your money makers (the sales team) a real salary with paid time off, benefits, and equity.
Toby the CEO has been charged with insider trading and his greediness lives on in the pay structure and company. Thats why you cannot find out any info about Womply online. He hides because he doesn't want people to realize he is a crook. Also he never bothers to introduce himself or associate with the sales team. (zero leadership qualities)

-It feels really good to sell a product that merchants seriously love. On my best day I closed 12 merchants. Some people close even more.

-Our managers work hard, which is rare and good to see since they ask that of us too
-The executive team is easy to talk to and does a lot to make a great culture.

2015-05-27,,,Current Employee ,Design,,0,"General comment: Womply has a lot of work to do on the design front and they aren't shy in saying that. They are now significantly investing in design. In the meantime, such a thing can be considered a blessing or a curse, depending on your personality. It's a blessing because you can come in and really have a huge part in shaping an entire company inside/out. It could be a curse because shaping an entire company requires a huge effort and patience.

Having said all that, here are my pros:
- Refreshingly fast, but efficient interview process.
- Defined company philosophy.
- They invest in people.
- The company is growing fast.
- Daily communication with CEO/Senior leadership.","- The company is growing fast. Space will soon become an issue.

For anyone who is starting, or continuing their career in sales, should apply. The training program is up tempo, which is great because it allows sales reps to get onto the phones sooner and start collecting commission.

We have social events with the entire company every month, and happy hours for meeting sales goals. The office also provides catered lunch on Fridays (always good, and I am picky) and the kitchen is stocked with plenty of snacks and drinks.

The most appealing part of working at Womply for me is it is a growing company and there is room for advancement if you work hard and show you can handle the responsibility, and the leadership is level headed and easy to work with.","Being a sales rep at Womply is a phone job so if you are not comfortable on the phone it may be challenging, but I have seen many sales reps struggle at first, but soon figure it out with the right amount of coaching and effort.

Good filler job if you need money for the time being.","Despite anything the Womply website says about the Account Executive role, it is actually quite different. Sales team are CONTRACTORS. Not actual employees of Womply. You will be hired in to an hourly position. There is NO payroll. Income is paid PRE-TAX. No benefits. No health/dental/401k. No Equity. No Sick days. No anything! Meanwhile, everyone else in the entire company DOES get all the above mentioned benefits. The sales team is excluded. Isn't it supposed to be the other way around? The sales team is very separated from the rest of the company in a lot of ways. IF YOU DIDN'T GRADUATE FROM A TOP TIER SCHOOL, THEN YOU WILL GET NO RESPECT FROM ANYONE OUTSIDE OF THE SALES TEAM.
A lot of transparency issues with OTE earnings that they disclose. I know a few of the Senior Account Executives making no where near the $90k OTE that was stated in the offer, even while outperforming the entire sales team! No opportunity for advancement, no opportunity for transferring to other positions.","Treat the sales team more like part of the ""family"" rather than some random people you don't know. Just because we didn't graduate from Stanford, UCLA, USC, etc., doesn't mean that we don't possess the skills necessary to get the job done.

If you need caffeine to start or drain your day, they offer tons of energy drinks in the fridge such as RedBull, and 5 Hour Energy drinks.","The inside sales team is small (5-6) people. This means that they are expanding by hiring 10 sales people/week, but they terminate 9/week, and the next batch of 10 start training the following week and repeat. The training room is a tiny room (5x7'), and they stuff 10 people in that room. I was sweating and grasping for air. There were times where the training manager would give us breaks to leave the room because everyone was about to pass out, and there were times where he couldn't stand being in the room himself and trained us outside in the patio where it was cold and windy. Horrible working conditions.

Womply's office is in a residential condominium. They occupy 2 loft units with no more than 900 sqft. This concerns me as there are many staffs (50-70) cramming their cubicles together. These units are meant for 1-2 people occupancy;not 50.

i don't recommend this company to anyone due to the fact that they hire and fire weekly, and minimal training (2days), then be expected to be terminated by the third day. What is worse on top of that is they fire you in front of everyone since there is no privacy at all except for the restrooms, which are literally right next to working cubicles and kitchen.

Be prepare to lie to small business owners. On your first day of calling merchants, they don't know that they are being charged monthly subscription even if they don't use Womply's product. This is very illegal and I will report this to the Better Business Bureau.

Lastly, Not many staff had worked there more than a year. Huge turn over including upper management. You can look them up on Google.","I hope the CEO of Womply,Toby Scammell won't repeat another felony.

- Womply's SaaS product is one that SMBs really need and see value in. Businesses have never been able to assess their reputation and performance the way our product is now allowing them to. Our success speaks for itself.

The company pays low wages and expects employees to live in San Francisco. The consensus around the office is people believe they are not fairly paid for their work.

The culture is similar to that of a jail – you are told you can work freely, but in reality you feel locked in, and you are made to feel guilty if you don’t stay until late into the evening.
