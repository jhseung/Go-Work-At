The pay and benefits were very good, which I belatedly realized I'd taken for granted!
The products are high quality and provide many positive aspects, which employees can feel good about. For example, you might work with a product that helps diabetics better control their disease or an instrument used in labs seeking the cure for diabetes or devices that are fast and accurate, getting you health answers quickly.","It's tough when you work for a company's largest market (US) and are still managed from afar. This frustration is compounded when strategies, tools, and programs are developed in the company's much smaller and different home market to apply everywhere. These ""gifts"" are given to the rest of the world with little leeway in their use. If changes are approved, the cost and time of retrofitting the ""gift"" falls on the receiving markets.
Although generally good, the prevailing culture, pace, and management style in the business areas vary widely. This is an issue when you move to another area, as you are encouraged to do, because you may go into an unexpectedly stressful environment. I once encouraged a friend to work at Roche. When they described the pressure, management style, and stressful atmosphere in their area I was shocked and embarrassed.","Avoid laying off seasoned employees for tenure, fiscal or re-organizing reasons. You are casting off a huge investment in their wisdom and experience. Instead, have that challengeing conversation to see if something could be arranged so that your investment isn't walking away to benefit the competition.
There are many ways to avoid meetings that still accomplish the goal of the meeting. Start implementing these alternatives and foster a ""meet as a last resort"" culture, which will increase productivity and reduce stress.

- ""Work/life balance"" is so good that I would describe working here as early retirement.","- Lack of coherent strategy. There seems to be little intentionality and executive leadership in Sequencing that affects all levels.
- Decision-making processes are extremely slow and inefficient. I would describe it as a Kafkaesque nightmare. Documentation and meetings are mistaken for actual work.
- A few extremely rude apples ruined the barrel. A senior technical lead once started a meeting with ""Show of hands for who thinks ____ is stupid?"", a contractor once posted publicly on LinkedIn asking how to decrease the influence of my role, a scientist at the VP level chastised me after thinking that I gave one of his reports constructive feedback (I hadn't, and the feedback was valid).

2019-02-18,,"Santa Clara, CA",Former Employee ,Toxic Work Culture in Santa Clara Sequencing,More than a year,0,"- The sequencing technology is interesting and has potential to move personalized medicine forward in the future.
- Free snacks and breakfast fare.
- Work/Life balance is pretty good.
- Roche appears to be centralizing all of their South Bay and Peninsula M&A targets at the Santa Clara site and turning it into an ""Innovation Center"". Could be a good opportunity to be able to transfer across many teams.","- Toxic work culture and management. Employees are sometimes publicly berated in meetings. Weekly meeting(s) are masqueraded as somewhere to share data and information across groups, but actually function as arenas where groups face off against each other vying for power and recognition. Back-stabbing and back-biting of teams against each other is commonplace. Fear, competition, and mistrust permeate the entire organization.
- Lack of concrete direction and strategy from executive and senior management leads to entire site scrambling for goals and direction every year.
- ""Innovate Now"" and ""Speak Up"" are two of the cultural beliefs, but almost no one is allowed to do anything innovative or out of the box. Anything that bucks the status quo is immediately met with resistance. ""We already tried that and it didn't work"", and then not having any data to back up claims seems to be the default response. People catch on quickly, stop trying to contribute new ideas, turn on ""coast mode"", and become ""yes"" men or women.
- Salaries are consistently below what other companies Pharma, Biotech, or Technology companies in the Bay Area are offering even though HR claims they are performing salary comparisons. People leaving for new opportunities regularly secure 30-40% compensation increases. Stock options are only offered to a select group of software engineers, data scientists or directors and above, good luck everyone else!
- Contractors are treated like second-hand citizens, and I have seen many cut loose before their contracts are up. I even witnessed one case where the contractor was given only 4 days of notice before being told they were being let go.
- Points above lead to a large number of disengaged workers that are trapped and looking for a way out. I have observed employees actively job searching in the open office environment and even in the middle of meetings that they are supposed to be engaged in!","- Remove toxic management and employees - put them on the roof or give them severance and send them on their way.
- Increase pay and compensation to actually be competitive with other companies in the Bay Area to help retain talent. I don't know where the HR are getting their numbers, but remuneration packages are not competitive.",1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

When it isn't good, it sucks. Unfortunately, when good leaders are put in roles they are moved around quickly. Advancement is nil unless you are in the boys club. Even the few women who get promoted are promoted as pawns for the men. Politics are horrible and collaboration between teams is hard. We are all supposed to be on the same side but leadership and people who are allowed to be idiots (""oh it is just so and so's way...."") make work harder. And if you are very good at your job as a worker bee, it is highly unlikely you are going to be promoted. They want you to continue in that capacity. They under use talent.",Stop shuffling people around so quickly. Hold leaders accountable to excellent leadership practices. Stop with the damn boy's club.

Bonus programs and decent pay.","However, it is deteriorating consistently for 2 years now and there is no end in sight. 9/80 option was eliminated and there's no intention to bring it back. Budget constraints are getting worse and worse as the company is fighting legacy problems. Research is taking a step back, product development is now done with external ""partners"" instead of in-house, software development has long been out-sourced and the trend is being continued. There's really no engineering work left that's worth doing and the future for that type of work looks bleak. Roche doesn't seem to mind that highly qualified and high-salaried engineers sit around and create documents and presentations all day as they keep on funding this travesty but if you are a motivated engineer who wants to expand your knowledge and learn new things in your field, then stay away.

Some will be very good friends with someone who is more important.

Managers and senior managers can come on board with no experience. Directors may have 0-3 years of experience. The politics are very thick, and not even close to fair. Being competent in this department is a severe handicap because that makes you a threat.

The girlfriend of the married boss may never come to work, and her job may be dumped on your lap at the last minute. Your ""superior"" coworker may spend all her time working for her contract clients instead of your shared employer, and all her train wrecks may be dumped in your lap. You may be treated as a slave by a boss with dyslexia who searches for typos in your work, can't teach you anything, takes credit for your work, and doesn't know how to lead. None of these people will ever cooperate with you by sharing necessary information or even telling the truth. They actually want you to fail at doing their jobs for them.

Some of the directors and senior managers are not competent (many are though).

The incompetent ones are the obvious elephants in the room, but upper management doesn't seem to reprimand appropriately, and prefers to sweep it under the rug with a guise of using the Culture of Accountability versus tackling the problem head on.

The incompetent middle management personality types fall into two main categories: they are either never around, or they are micro-managers who don't know what they are talking about and mask their ignorance and incompetence by questioning and talking condescendingly to functional study team members.

The micro-managers get so wrapped up in details of everything, but they're never around to know the details so they endlessly scrutinize all the work the study teams performs which inevitably stresses out the team members who deal with the details and study work on a daily basis. It would be one thing if they understood processes and had valid, constructive feedback and points to make, but they question and scrutinize for the sake of hiding their own lack of knowledge and to feed their superiority complexes at the end of the day so they can go home feeling accomplished for doing something other than complaining and pushing emails all day.

The micro-managers also have a double standard of what they require of functional study team staff compared to what they provide themselves. They require transparency but do not complete the flow by being transparent downward (even to their own staff); They harp other functional areas to complete dependencies sooner than expected to compensate for their own delays in timelines.

This ultimately crushes morale and turns staff off from even wanting to interactive with these individuals.","- Scrap having middle management sign off on study documentation and leave this to the functional leads

- Before they send out interrogating emails and belittle member in the occasional study team meetings they attend, have middle management train on processes and work instructions which they clearly don't understand due to just clicking a training button in the training system

- Above all, stop ignoring the issue as to why staff keeps leaving. Clearly there is a pattern.",3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

Hard work and innovation is rewarded.","Even tho I was terminated, I still don't really have anything negative to say about the company. Some areas have the ""mob mentality"" so if you're the newest member and someone doesn't like you, it could be rough if leadership puts their trust in the wrong people. Peer to peer feedback is encouraged and accepted, but unfortunately there are still people who prefer drama over professionalism. Every company has a few cons, but at Roche the pros far out way the cons for anyone who can rise above the few bad apples, can accept as well as give constructive feedback , and that depict the Roche Cultural Beliefs in everything they do.","Stay true to your leadership training and the Roche Cultural Beliefs. I believed in my leadership and trusted them to have my best interest heart. I believed them when they told me ""your performance and work ethic will take you far in your career here,"" ""your dedication to the team, our customers, and stake holders is inspiring and present in everything you do,"" ""you're a rockstar and can't wait to see all the great things you will accomplish."" I was told there were members of my team that were threatened by me. I asked how to approach that and was told I had nothing to worry about. I asked because I wanted to be respectful and a positive addition to an established team, and as an admin my role was to support the team in anything they needed. I was no threat because I was the only admin there wasn't any competition so to speak. I supported leadership that trusted my ability to get things done correctly the first time, and at times that put me in situations to where I was leading a task that would normally have been something the other members of the team would do prior to me joining the department. Due to my experience in a different role within the organization it made perfect business sense for me to complete the task, and I even went as far as offering to work with the other members and advise them who to reach out to in order to avoid any delays so that they could easily lead the task and I could just be support if needed. My leadership failed me by not following their training, the Roche Cultural Beliefs, and Roche policy regarding corrective action or disciplinary action. Had they done so, I could've have proven with multiple emails and provided the names of the individuals who I worked with to complete 2 very specific tasks that I was rewarded with Applause points for stepping in and completing, yet were used as examples of ""ineffective performance"" and resulted in my termination. It's unethical and morally wrong to terminate an employee for
""Ineffective performance"" when there are disciplinary records and no documented counseling for performance concerns or anything for that matter, less than 2 weeks after telling them they are meeting and exceeding expectations at their level and performing some duties at the next level. It's very apparent that I was targeted and failed a popularity contest with my peers; but if a peer is threatened by a peer and fails to give feedback because they are not professional and adult enough to do so and instead complains to leadership, it's leaderships responsibility to address the situation with both employees because you can't be held accountable for something you don't know about it.",3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0

Employees are not judged on their contributions; they're often judged based on who likes whom resulting in significant amounts of mobbing (bullying). Consequently, top talent frequently leaves the company and this is weakening their sales and marketing strength. And if you're a woman in the organization, your chances of being promoted to a management position are slim. This is a company that actually has an MBO to promote women into management roles. What does that tell you about how women are really thought of at Roche? If you're a man and you know how to mob your staff, your chances of getting ahead are far more increased.
