2019-01-15, Mid Market Account Executive,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Such a breath of fresh air,Less than a year,0,"-Unified and welcoming culture, always have team building events going on and not cliquey at all!
- Executive coaching offered to employees 6x/ year is awesome, love that they invest in not only executives but ALL employees
- Breakfast/lunch/ dinner and all gourmet cooked by in-house Asana employees (not catered) is AMAZING, always something new, all of it cooked fresh and feels super healthy.
- Management that is very much open to feedback and suggestions to make us all more effective.
- Dog friendly offices I thought would be so distracting but they're actually so great and well-behaved and its nice to see a cute friendly face throughout the day
- A sales team thats not only hitting but exceeding their quotas!! And leaders that want to keep that up.","- You just have to be flexible and a self starter, no one's going to hold your hand or micromanage you, so its on you to get work done...which I actually love but some people could see as a con.
- It's a start up, so new product releases, new processes, trial and error and again just the ability to adapt to that if you're not used to it already could be seen as a challenge.","Keep doing what you're doing! Continue to trust your employees, appreciate feedback, diversify your workforce and hold us accountable. You're doing great and we all feel it!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2019-01-16,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Extremely fresh managers and low compensation, but good mission and people",More than a year,0,"• The mission is legit and most people do care about helping other teams thrive/succeed by using the product.
• Higher management is full of smart & experienced people. Lots to learn from if you try hard enough to learn from it.
• Software is internally used to manage your daily workload (and it works!)
• Your teammates are generally fun
• Lots of opportunities to grow your skill-set if you're in Ops","• People managers are generally inexperienced and given way too much trust
• ""Transparency"" existed for a minute and then was wiped out of the organization
• Overly serious about itself and how playful it is, but never really feels adult
• Conscious Leadership Group never stops feels like a Corporate Philosophy
• Compensation is way below market and receiving positive adjustments to that in a way that feels ""timely"" is almost impossible
• HR/People Ops problems rarely get fixed and are swept deep under the rug
• You will work more hours a day than you'd probably expect, partly because there some how aren't enough people to do the work and the work will still be expected of you.","Focus on fixing problems that your employees bring up every review cycle.

2018-12-27,,,Former Employee ,Very Satisfied With My Time At Asana,,0,"Almost everyone seemed genuinely happy at the company. People worked, took time to relax both at work and at home. Company parties were great.","Because so few people leave, many of my professional connections are still at Asana instead of spread out throughout the Silicon Valley like if I had worked at Google for example.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
2018-12-03, Program Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Excellent opportunities for growth and mindful management,More than a year,0,"No micro-management and an abundant amount of opportunity for those willing to go the extra mile. Leadership will listen (even if it takes a while to get time on their calendar) and treats employee ideas with thoughtful consideration and reflection. The ability to create your own path is available for anyone that's ambitious and driven.

Culture is good, food is the unimaginably delicious, and your co-workers are happy and positive. Great vibes when entering the building.","Thoughtfulness can breed slow decision making at times, you need to have strong conviction in order to weather the storm at times. The engineering-focused systems that were set in place during the early years of the company can be difficult for business teams to gel with. Cross-functional processes and teams can be bottle-necked by one employee or key decision maker, hopefully, this will be fixed with more hiring and scaling of internal teams. Product team can portray a superiority complex at times, but when you understand that it's in the companies best interest to make sure the engineers are happy that's ok.",Continue to attack the market and make Asana the brand and product it has the potential to be.

2018-11-05,,,Former Employee ,Fantastic Company,,0,"One of the most thoughtful, intentional groups of people you'll find anywhere.

2018-10-31,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Fantastic onboarding & highly scalable culture,Less than a year,0,"Never before have I witnessed a company whose culture is so well thought out and intentioned, and the company and its people truly stick to it and embody it every day. I realized in my first week with facilities and culinary alone —&nbsp;this company has things down, and it's because of how much they care about the environment that it's creating for its employees. The offices are SO clean, the facilities program is top notch - you don't see office managers running around scrambling because we're out of snacks again - it's a well oiled machine. And the culinary program is incredible. Extremely healthy and delicious meals served 3x a day, and snacks and every kind of tea served all day and literally everything is made in-house. The culinary team isn't just an extension, they are a part of the team and the company and they have a super important purpose of fueling, energizing, and delighting employees so they can be as productive as possible.

So those are some perks. The onboarding here is really amazing. It's very comprehensive - you'll get intros and overviews to things in the company you didn't even realize it would be helpful to know about, and it exposes you 360-degrees to the whole company by introducing you to people on different teams and learning from them. I've never felt more genuinely welcomed, and they really make you feel that they care about you being set up for success. The great thing is that all of this rings true even after the onboarding ""honeymoon phase"" so to speak, and that's just the way people are at Asana. Friendly, welcoming, inclusive, and collaborative.","Asana has a very unique culture and it takes longer than you'd expect to get fully immersed and onboarded. They use their product internally exclusively, meaning you're living and breathing the mission of the company, but that's typically very foreign to a lot of people coming from traditional tech workplaces relying on email and google docs. If you want a run of the mill type of company, this isn't the place for you, but if you give it a little time and believe in yourself, it will be well worth it.","The business is making tremendous gains in the market and Asana has just won awards and industry recognition across every category, from the business to the product to the culture - so keep up the great vision and strategy work that is driving our momentum!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2018-09-19, Sales Representative,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Asana is growing the right way,Less than a year,0,"The Food.

Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner every single day.

The munchies are next level. All healthy, organic, fresh, locally sourced, delicious, mind-blowing, crisp, umami, accessible, routine, thoughtful, . . . . . you get the idea. Food very thoughtful, tasty, and everything is labeled for those with restrictions.

 We're making the transition from a smaller company (B2C-y) to a larger company (B2B-y), which is always a challenge. I believe in our leadership across pretty much the entire business to grow the product and the sales/marketing engine the right way. We're gaining momentum, which is exciting to watch.

The Benefits - like other big tech firms, we have pretty much everything.

We are in the city of San Francisco. Asana is compared alongside giants like Facebook, Google, etc down south, but the fact that our office is in SF is a huge benefit to me personally.

The top-down mindfulness is really special. Dustin and JR (the founders) are super smart and enable a culture of self-awareness and self-reflection. It shows in the product as well.

Product - We're in a great spot, we're building some awesome stuff. Product seems to be in-line with the business needs and direction of the company.","Competition is real, we're in a super crowded space.

Everyone is super nice, but can be a bit cliquey. Especially visible at meals. It seems like a decent number of teams pretty much only hang out with their teammates.

The distributed office layout means that there are fewer opportunities to meet random people on other teams/floors.

Compensation is a hot topic right now. I think I'm paid well in my department, but some folks are frustrated that we dont pay the same as the Facebooks and Googles of the world.

Super flat org, clarity into career growth is a bit opaque/still forming.","I'd love to see more cross-team bonding. Not necessarily happy hours, just something where two teams can meet and greet.

Keep an eye out for competition, they could be closing in on us faster than y'all think! (i.e. Please keep building innovative products please)",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
2018-09-12,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Believe the hype,Less than a year,0,"I initially applied at Asana because I was coming from someplace with an awful culture, and I wanted the opposite. So far Asana has made my work culture dreams come true, and I'm approaching my one-year anniversary.

The people at Asana who I see thriving and loving their time here are hard workers who are kicking butt every day. If you are brilliant, have a good attitude and not afraid of hard work, people notice and you get what you are due. A mediocre employee and/or an employee whose goal is to squeak by without exerting themselves won’t be happy here.

With that said, the culture and benefits make it easier to work hard than anywhere else I’ve ever been. Knowing that I can go across the street to the gym for my mid-day break, and I’ll have a healthy and delicious breakfast and lunch (and dinner if I decide to stay late), counts for a lot when you are working hard!

Not sure if I should put this in pros or cons, but: Asana professes to have a flat org structure, but even so there are obviously an executive-level group of people. As with any group of people, they range in personality, approachability etc. With that said, I think that overall/on average they are some of the most approachable and ""cool"" execs I've met at a company.

Highlights:
Food
Untracked PTO
Great health/dental
Professional coaching benefits (DO take advantage of these!)
Talented and fun coworkers","In spite of No Meeting Wednesdays, it does sometimes seem like there are a LOT of meetings.

Not sure if you would call this a ""con,"" but:
No one will bow down and praise you for doing the minimum of what you were hired to do. I actually see this as a positive, but there are people in the world who think they are due certain things in life simply by merit of existing.

Prepare to be surrounded by some pretty brilliant people and for people to expect you to work hard and crush it as well.","Reconsider what necessitates a meeting and challenge the conventional wisdom of having regular meeting cadence for certain things.

OH! And build out your headcount and resources in your D&I department! It's already pretty good, but I can't imagine how much more could be achieved and the message it would send to build it out further.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2018-09-12,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Thrilled to be on this ride,More than a year,0,"- Business trajectory is off the charts - our growth rate is increasing quarter over quarter putting us in rarified air for SaaS startups at our stage.
- The category is new and we're getting to shape it as we change the way people approach and achieve their goals at work.
- We're encouraged to move fast - thoughtfully - giving us all the reward of innovation and iteration while mitigating the risk of having a mess to clean up later.
- More than anywhere else I've worked, cross functional teams are on the same page with the same goals in mind and the learning opportunities of being part of these groups are boundless.
- The people around you are invested in your success professionally and personally and you can feel that in every interaction.
- If you're good at your job, the opportunities are endless. The leadership team is great at identifying top performers and creating opportunities for them to expand their role and continue challenging them.
- The work is hard and sometimes requires a lot of extra hours, but it's interesting and feels important and I wouldn't have it any other way.
- I'm still blown away daily by the benefits / perks / etc. offered for a company of our size.","- It sometimes feels like we're trying to hold onto some Asana artifacts that aren't realistic to maintain as we scale, and I think this slows us down at times.
- I do think there's more meetings than are necessary and the preparation required for them is often more work than they're worth.","- Focus on doing what drives clarity and be ok with letting what used to work go if it's no longer serving it's purpose.
- Don't be afraid to talk about the hard stuff!

Asana is an incredible company. The most shocking realization for me was the alignment between what the company says (including it's blog posts) and what it does. Nothing feels disingenuous and because we all use the product together we have a good understanding of what's happening at all times - really reducing my anxiety.",It's still a growing company so there are a lot of areas which are still being worked on and improved. The difference between Asana and other companies I've been at is that Asana is aware of the areas that aren't working well and anyone is free to help out and improve them. This probably isn't a good company for someone who needs to be 'told' exactly what to do - the belief in distributed responsibility is real and enables a lot of creativity + autonomy but that also means each person has to embrace it and take that responsibility.,I don't think much of the world has really 'clicked' for our mission.

2018-09-20,,,Current Employee ,Hyper growth company hitting its stride,Less than a year,0,"Asana has an establish reputation as a leader in their space - which is growing. From a product that has a dedicated fan base and cool customers - Pinterest, National Geographic, Gates Foundation and tons of work and personal use cases (campaigns! launches! packing lists! weddings!) - the opportunity to do work that has impact is high and meaningful.

They walk the walk when it comes to creating a positive and supportive employee experience and live their commitments around inclusion. The Real Talk community event series and sponsored Employee Resource Groups (Team Rainbow, Gradient and Asana Women) are led authentically by employees who have a variety of interests and points of view. There are some incredible female leaders in the company who have super diverse experience and are at various stages of their careers and life - which is really great to see. Also the Conscious Leadership training and Coaching benefits are incredible and really set the tone for personal growth and development support.

The company is growing its global efforts too - lots of international opportunities in Europe and spending time in the other offices like Dublin and NY is encouraged. There is also a good blend of wanting to win and grow as a business and a culture that doesn't take itself too seriously - yetis! I really feel supported in my role, love my team and see nothing but upside ahead.","Not so much cons as opportunities:

The company has big ambitions and a plan to get there - challenge is prioritizing which opportunities will have the biggest impact and recruiting awesome people to help us keep moving forward.

We are actively hiring and investing in supporting career growth and development - it's competitive so being more open about what makes the business trajectory and opportunity to do career making work here unique vs other companies is key since we are known in some pockets and not in others.",Stay true to founding values and mission driven product intent while evolving early stage company ways that may no longer scale as we grow.

AoRs: More ease and clarity about AoRs or adopt a new model.

Titles: Standardize titles that sync with the market so we don't have to explain what our job is to external people all the time.

Leadership: Engage even more with ICs by asking interested/curious questions about people, their roles and their lives.

Hiring: Many of my referrals were passed on who I know could have done a fantastic job for Asana. We need to look outside ""the box"" and invest in hiring people even if they do not check every single box, especially in this highly competitive market.

In a recent Fast Company article, it was said that Asana ""is built on the idea that mindfulness, clear communication, and compassion are all critical to long-term success. Asana has become known for its radically inclusive, positive work environment.""

I would hands down agree with this quote. Asana is one of the best companies I've ever worked for.

My favorite things about Asana are the people, the resource groups, the amazingly healthy food, and the company culture.

I notice that people of color and those part of minority groups are empowered to bring their full selves to work and flourish.","1. The company is growing rapidly which has the potential to shift the company culture if management doesn't actively make the inclusive environment a priority.

2. Working from home a few times a week would be awesome but we try to shy away from this as they'd like employees to be in the office when working. The standard is to only WFH twice a month but they're pretty lax if you produce quality work.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

Work life balance is good, although not as good as places where there just isn’t enough work to do (e.g. LinkedIn or some teams at google)","Compensation is way below market, especially for experienced engineers.

Product oriented org means there is a lot of red tape for engineers to ship new features unless they have already been approved by the product people.
Lots of tech debt
Although the culture is above average, the constant patting on the back of how great the Asana culture is tends to get grating. We don’t need to keep hearing how awesome our culture is - let’s work on making it better.

3.) Tying into (2), the work environment is super collaborative, meaning that I get to work with engineers (and non-engineers) far removed from my core team, which is really awesome.

4.) Culinary team is one of a kind. Food is amazing, healthy, and they put on a lot of fun, unique events.

5.) At Asana, we use the Asana product daily, which is great because seeing yourself become more productive as a result of a feature you built feels really rewarding.

6.) Using the Asana product also means that we benefit from having clarity about who's doing what by when. This really helps us get more out of our days while minimizing ""status-update"" type meetings that would otherwise drain a lot of time.","1.) There is some large technical debt that the company is still working with.

Great benefits.","Asana has a great marketing team that has painted a picture of a company that isn't doing that much but appears in the media as this incredibly diverse and inclusive company that is saving the world. In reality, the product is just okay - nothing groundbreaking. The company is well funded and the co-founders have a great pedigree. Everyone knows that eventually, Asana will go IPO and until that time comes they're creating an illusion of ""working"". Projects get started and then lost in the universe because they don't matter. No one has answers to your questions - because no one actually knows where things live and what processes are, etc.

Long story short - if you're looking for a workplace where you can come in to meditate, drink green smoothies, and sit in meetings all day then Asana is a great place for you! But if you're eager to learn and grow your career I would recommend going somewhere else.

2017-11-01, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Feels like a perfect time to be at Asana,More than a year,0,"Technical challenges: Back when I first considered working at Asana, I was skeptical if there would be interesting engineering challenges given what I knew about the product. I was completely wrong - the work here has been the most fun work I've ever done. Asana is at a point where scaling further has required challenging previous foundational technical decisions, opening the way for engineers to get involved in architecting better solutions that will affect the company for years to come.

Impact: I've never worked at a place where my impact felt so apparent. Teams set KRs that directly relate to top-level company objectives, and almost every piece of work you do is in service of some KR. Its success is measured against these criteria, and teams are really good at consistently recognizing and celebrating every accomplishment and the people behind it.

Culture: Lots to love, but my favorite aspect is probably the feedback culture that exists. No one says ""not my problem, hopefully someone else will do it""; either they lead the way to fix it, or they seek out the most capable team / people to solve it and provide that feedback directly to them. This is critical in surfacing issues before they are serious problems and has been extremely helpful in allowing the company to scale without many things falling through the cracks.

Food: The meals at Asana are well beyond ""perk"" level - they're delicious, healthy, and always so different from day to day. I love that everyone eats in the same place and that the standard is to grab a seat at one of the big tables and share a meal with whoever happens to be there.

Mission: When you use Asana (the product) the way Asana (the company) uses it, it becomes immediately evident how powerful of a tool it is for fostering better communication and planning, and in general just enabling an individual to be more connected to what's going on in the company. It's exciting to be a part of making it even better, and to be helping our customers achieve the same.","You can gain a lot of responsibility really quickly at Asana if you aren't careful about saying ""no"". It's not hard to get yourself in a situation where you have multiple things that urgently need your attention.

The system used to evaluate employees is a little opaque, which can be uncomfortable when you're used to a system with clear levels and clear responsibilities attached to those levels.","I know there is active work to add more structure to employee responsibilities, expectations, and evaluation - continue it.

There is a lot of trust around the work we do, and the way we interact with each other versus backstabbing, politics, and intentional miscommunication. My team really feels like a team.
—Asana treats you as a human first, then employee. From the amazing benefits package (best health insurance of my life!), to the other-worldly perks (culinary team should get a Michelin star), there is also the expectation that you enjoy them and take advantage of them. They are realistic about the lives employees lead outside of work, and care about them. I've never been expected to
—Empowerment is real. If I don't like what I'm doing, I can say so and expect a change; if I want to learn something new, it's as easy as scheduling a meeting; if I question what we're doing, I can ask and expect answers; if I want to say my real opinion, I can, and not fear the consequences; if I point out something crummy for women in the workplace, it's taken seriously. Sometimes you will be your biggest obstacle at work.
—We take what we do seriously. From the facilities team, to customer success, everybody is so intelligent, motivated, and curious about what they do. This is a really talented work force that's very passionate about Asana.","—We tout diversity but there are still many teams that play into exactly what you would expect (leadership is almost exclusively male; sales is very white male heavy; still not enough women in product; Latino/a/x's are virtually nonexistent).
—There are many aspects of our culture that will not scale as we continue to grow, making it feel a little more like a traditional B2B SaaS workplace in some respects. Granted, we're still way ahead of the game, but at 500, 750, 1000 employees, I don't know that I'll come to work with the same ""family"" feel that I have now.
—We're still figuring out how to operate between HQ and two remote offices. We're much more accommodating than before and move quickly to make improvements, but there's still strain and pain in working with and from remote offices.
—We're really great at planning (e.g., roadmap week) but in the day-to-day, we aren't as good at managing priorities, incoming work, and making sure we're tackling the most important things. Maybe this is different for other teams, but for mine, there's more work to do.
—Still engineering-centric in certain regards that can make Business/Ops teams feel less prioritized. But I think we're making improvements.","—Continue to diversify management, but in the meantime, get more involved in internal efforts and discussions around these things. It speaks magnitudes to see management at diversity events from time to time.

Processes and rules-of-thumb that worked with 50 people are starting to fall apart. This is, of course, balanced by efforts to create new processes that scale. This will probably be successful, but there is some lag time. For example, on the engineering side, there is a large bias towards planning and building consensus. As more people come to the table, consensus is harder and harder, and so attaining consensus (or going ahead without it) can be frustrating.

2017-08-18, Data Scientist,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Truly wonderful place to work,More than 3 years,0,"There are a lot of reasons to love working here, but here are a few:
- Incredible colleagues, who are both very talented and very humble. People are very interested in helping each other out, collaborating, etc. And they're also super chill.
- Very high degree of transparency across just about everything, except the most sensitive of matters like compensation
- Strong focus on personal and professional growth, including a very active internal mentorship program, where many people seek to learn skills outside of their function (or within it) from other employees
- Great perks and benefits, including yoga classes multiple times every weekday, completely covered health insurance, very generous parental leave, untracked PTO, etc
- Culinary team that cooks 3 meals a day for us 5 days a week (except dinner on Fridays). Delicious, healthy food, that's well-sourced.
- Strong emphasis on work/life balance, and taking a good amount of vacation time, which the cofounders both advocate for.

I work on the Data Science team, whose mission is to generally support almost all teams across the org to help them make better decisions and to inform their direction.

2017-07-13, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Truly awesome,Less than a year,0,"I tend to be skeptical about ""too good to be true"" things, so I came in with somewhat tempered expectations. However, this turned out to be completely unjustified. The great company culture at Asana isn't just hype, it's real.

There are many great things that have been cultivated at the Asana work environment but perhaps more important than the particulars is the process through which such a great environment has developed. Developing a great work environment and culture is not just something that is paid lip service to, but something that is actively focused on in every decision made.

Some of the details that particularly appeal to me though:

Your manager isn't there to dictate what you do, but to support you in becoming a better engineer and achieving your own goals. Employee growth isn't one-track either - there are several different areas in which an employee can grow, and depending on the employee's particular personality, they can choose to grow broadly or focus on a few areas where they'd like to grow in their role.

The coworkers are a really great group of people. All the engineers are extremely talented and smart, and many have backgrounds at places like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox, but you'll also meet various engineers from a non-traditional background as well (such as a music major who worked for Hans Zimmer once). People at Asana are extremely supportive and inviting. I hypothesize the employees here are nicer from the outset due to being a self-selected group (since the work culture appealed to them), but the positive and collaborative environment also brings out the best in everyone - I've certainly noticed this happen for myself.

The engineering team is still small enough that as an engineer you can work on the core frameworks running the product, whether they be on Android or iOS, web client, or on the server., on such things as the data model, pub-sub system for reactivity, or client datastore.

Perhaps best of all is the opportunity to work on a product that is experiencing rapid user growth (particularly for the enterprise market) and is beloved by its users. It's really encouraging to look at tweets to @asana on and see how much users love the product and the company.","It always feels like there is so much more that we could add to the product if only we had more engineers, but we're stuck prioritizing because of basic constraints due to the number of engineers. We're actively growing the engineering team but it's a tight market, particularly for the very talented engineers that Asana selects for. The flip side is that that Asana is focusing on sustainable growth is likely to achieve profitability sooner rather than later due to revenue growth outpacing spending growth.

There are internal levels and salary bands used by the compensation people to ensure pay is fair and equitable, but employees don't have direct insight into what level they're considered internally. All that employees know is their salary and stock grants. This means less direct transparency as to how the company views you and whether your own perception of your growth as an employee matches that of the company. The thinking is that this will cause employees to focus more on holistic growth, but I'm not sure it's worth the lack of transparency in an otherwise very transparent organization.

Location is a bit of a walk from BART and rather far from the nearest Caltrain station. It is, however, right off of the freeway. This may be more of a short term factor though, as the main office will probably have to move to a new building in the coming years due to expansion.","Keep up the great work, and continue the work on targeting large enterprise companies in addition to the bottom-up user-growth we currently have.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

As a result, the culture helps minimize politics and make everyone focus on working together to solve real problems. People are very intrinsically motivated since they feel empowered to speak up and just go ahead to get s* done. Nobody tells you what you should do nor do you need to seek several layers of approval to do anything. On the other hand, there's massive amounts of support from your peers to help you succeed. We are a community of peers who strive to learn from each other and help each other succeed. This all trickles down from the founders who act as examples by being humble, intellectually curious, reflective and taking 100% responsibility. In my entire career, I've never seen the CEO of the company get publicly challenged by employees (in a respectful way) and, instead of shutting people down, patiently explain reasons behind hard decisions and admit things that can be done in a better way.

2016-10-12, Product Marketing,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Actual rainbows and unicorns,Less than a year,0,"I love coming into work every day. Between our product's unicorns and beautiful color gradients, it's actual rainbows and unicorns around here...

—I'm surrounded by very intelligent, hilarious, quirky, inspiring people. You know that jerk in upper management that knows more than you? They don't work here. And that person that you don't even trust to run the copy machine? They don't work here either. I admire and respect my colleagues and despite the fact that we are growing like crazy, but the quality bar hasn't lowered one bit. Additionally, what Asanas do outside of work is impressive.

—We're maybe even beyond work/life balance...working is a part of life, life creeps into your work. They aren't separate things. Asana has deep love and respect for its employees by way of benefits and the attitude it takes towards keeping people happy, supported, and healthy. I do yoga on site (and could every day, twice a day if I wanted); I meditate in small corners of the office; if I feel sick, I can work from home or take time to rest; the medical benefits are amazing; artwork and cool office design abound; I go for lunch runs; I get to share the healthiest meals made by culinary artists with colleagues; my wage is extremely livable so I can enjoy living in one of the most expensive but fun cities in the world; our work events are better than some parties I've been to; I'm writing this review from a treadmill desk; if I need to step away from work, I can organize a coffee walk with anybody; we work hard but also get to celebrate our efforts together...you get to come in and be your human self instead of stuffing everything into a box and then letting go when you leave the building. I'm sure there are moments where we get jaded, but we're still a pretty humble, grateful bunch.

—I feel safe and accepted for who I am, and am encouraged to bring even more of myself to work. We want that to extend to the product too, by way of hiring a diverse array of people, and making our product geared towards all kinds of teams. We support and host tons of events emphasizing diversity in tech and San Francisco. We also have learning talks to stay informed about issues in the community and country at large, and have a director of diversity to make sure these things stay at the forefront instead of being tacked on in last-ditch efforts.

—You're encouraged to explore, try, and create (in your own role, team, and across teams). We take failure seriously so we can learn from it and not be afraid of it, but we're open about it. Despite some goofs here and there, I really love and believe in our product. We use it ourselves and I really don't know how I would work without it. There's so much transparency into what we've done, what we're doing, and what we will do. That's by way of our product, as well as management's philosophy. Most Fridays, there's an all-company event or meeting so we can stay in the know about what's going on, have time to bond and interact with different teams, or to discuss serious topics for our company or in the world at large.

—My day to day job is actually fun. And if it's not, I'm empowered to make it something else. My boss isn't here to manage me by way of telling me what to do, but by supporting me to achieve what is challenging and interesting to me. I'm entrusted with all kinds of work, and can exercise control over my realm of work. Whatever I want to learn, colleagues are happy to teach me, or provide resources to learn it myself. I'm not relegated to one task, nor am I spread thin. If I'm over or underwhelmed, I can be real about it. My day-to-day is always an adventure.","—We are reaching the stage of startup growth where we are rapidly expanding, so there is a clearer distinction between who is new and who's been around and ""how it used to be."" It will be interesting to see how our culture and retention maps to continued rapid growth. So far, so good, though.

—In the general tech world, a lot of companies get caught up in how they're changing the world, but then sometimes you have to stop and embrace that you are also enterprise software. Yes, we're revolutionizing the concept of work and the workplace and making huge impacts, but there are teams out there changing the world in other ways.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Dustin knows how to run a successful business, and hires people who know how to execute. The level of education, experience, and talent at this company is absolutely unparalleled.

The biggest reason why Asana is able to attract and retain this great talent is its transparency and approachability. Decisions are made out in the open, every piece of work is followable, every important piece of work has an assignee, and very little falls through the cracks. This completely disables any blame passing, and allows credit to be distributed to the correct places.

Standard tech company perks like free food, transit reimbursement, fantastic facilities, unlimited time off, and company events round out why Asana is a 5-star employer.","Teams are growing - product sits upstairs and the business teams sit downstairs.

From top to bottom, there is a strong focus on keeping employees engaged and empowered. Employees are treated with a level of trust that I haven't seen at any other company.

Also, the on-boarding process was amazing - Asana uses the Asana software extensively internally, including an extensive new employee project that is a guide to everything you need to know about your first few months with the company. The efficiency with which I was brought up to speed and able to feel like I was contributing meaningfully to my team was remarkable.","While it's a beautiful office with great views and comfortable furniture throughout, it can also be a very loud and distracting office. As the team grows, the noise continues to grow as well, and I actually find myself missing the personal space and sound muffling of the typical corporate cubicle farm. There are places where you can duck away for some peace and quiet, but if you dislike open floor plans you will find yourself booking conference rooms frequently.","Find more ways to mitigate the noise in the large open areas. Also, many talented engineers who would be interested in joining the team are turned off by the discouragement for remote work - as the team grows and the Bay Area becomes more and more expensive and difficult to commute, more flexibility in employee location would be a huge boon.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2016-03-02, Customer Success Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Welcome home!,,0,"I knew the second I walked into the office for my interview that this was the place I wanted to work. There's an undeniable vibe that's impossible to put into words, but you just want to be here. Surrounded by incredibly talented and kind individuals, who are not only as fun to work with as they are driven. Here I am empowered to take control of my own career, and supported by every member of the company to do so. We truly are a company of peers here, and our management structure is incredibly unique. We value peer and self reviews, you're not reduced down to a number you contribute but the quality of your work, and if you want to be a little weird sometimes that’s totally encouraged.

At my last company I took issue with the lack of experience my executive team had in trying to grow a company (and the subsequent toxic trickle down effect), but here JR and Dustin have oodles of experience (and nothing but love and good vibes to share with us). I've never worried about the direction the company is moving because I know we are in good hands. They've built their teams with other experienced and diverse individuals, who are respected by the broader community, and always willing to share any company insights one might be wondering about. We pride ourselves on the transparency and visibility of our product, but that seeps into our company practices as well.

I’ll speak to perks, they’re obviously awesome, but I’ll just say that shouldn’t be the only reason you want to work here. Super competitive salaries and health care packages, a full culinary team devoted to healthy meals three times a day ( + homemade snacks), commuter benefits, in house yoga and gym memberships, learning lunches and guest speaker talks, Uber credits, un-monitored vacation, monthly happy hours and events, and professional life coaching! Plus, we're pet friendly so if you got one at home feel free to bring 'em in! We’re incredibly mindful of the humans (or if you don’t identify as human that’s cool too) we recruit, so if you’re looking to jump head first, roll up your sleeves, and be a part of our mission we’re excited to have you.","I literally just spent 10 minutes trying to think of a downside. They only thing I could produce was we need to start conceptualizing more leadership roles, and work on diversifying our hiring. (However this is something we are actively doing, and I'll also note this is one of the more gender diverse offices I've worked in- yay!!)","Keep doing what you're doing, stay open to listening to your company's voice, and stay present as we grown and scale the culture.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2016-03-02,,,Current Employee ,"superlative culture, product and opportunities for success",,0,"+ empowerment: the culture of empowerment authentically imbues everyone's work here. it's definitely not just lip service -- asana takes individuals and teams being empowered to make change extremely seriously. i was contributing real, impactful work on my second day here.

+ apolitical nature of teamwork: even when resources are constrained, there isn't the same culture of scarcity here as i've seen other places. people mindfully explore how to make each decision a win for all parties involved (including, always, the customer!)

+ quirkiness: you see this everywhere, from traditions to colleagues to the product itself. you are given more than permission to be yourself, deviate from the norm, and have fun with your work.

+ employee care: we have delicious, nutritious food served communally every day. we have in-office yoga, company-supported professional coaching, and a number of other carefully crafted opportunities to care for yourself while working hard.

+ quality of team: the people that i work with are some of the smartest, most passionate and funniest people i've ever met. i feel so lucky to have met them, let alone work with them on impactful projects every day.

+ transparent communication: another example of something many companies talk about, but is truly realized at asana. from the leadership to individual meetings, asana is a place where you can place implicit trust in others and are allowed to speak freely. this, i think, is at the basis of all the other pros on the list -- we are encouraged to ask questions about everything and identify opportunities to continue raising the bar.","- not a con, per se, but navigating a non-hierarchial structure steeped in empowerment is a sharp learning curve. also one of the best things about the company, but remains one of the biggest challenges in on-boarding.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2016-03-02, Software Developer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Working here has made me a better engineer, but also a better person",More than 3 years,0,"When I was younger, I was more abrasive - being right was more important than being kind. I've been at Asana for 3+ years now and I think it's been the biggest growth opportunity of my life - being surrounded by people who are so smart they'd be intimidating, but they're incredibly nice, helpful and humble? That rubs off on you. You realize that teams genuinely work better when they trust each other to be kind. And it doesn't mean you can't be 100% honest - I've had co-workers give me incredibly constructive feedback, but if they hadn't been as empathetic I probably would have gotten defensive, rather than really learned from it.

I could go on - about the mission, about the food, about the distributed responsibility system - but I think that for me the one more salient factor is a culture that doesn't just pay lip service to kindness and empathy, but practices it, trains it, hones it. And if studies about the effects of psychological safety on teamwork are to be believed, it might just be our secret weapon.","It becomes really, really hard imagining working somewhere that a) doesn't have the same passion for inclusive culture and b) doesn't use Asana to get work done.

2016-03-02, Product Designer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,A true diamond in the rough,Less than a year,0,"I've never even heard of another company who is so incredibly thoughtful and intentional about everything they do. Everything about the ""employee experience"" has been carefully designed to maximize employee happiness, productivity and healthiness. There is a balanced cadence to the way work gets done that is very purposeful. This balance and purposefulness can be seen in everything from how meetings are scheduled to the overall growth of the company. You will be empowered to do some of the most impactful work of your career here, without getting burned out. As a designer, I've been very pleased by the collaborative, professional, respectful and creative atmosphere at Asana. Everyone on the team is very intelligent and proud of the work they do, and that dynamic is infectious. It's truly a community of peers where every person is great at what they do, and not arrogant about it. There's a very mindful and pervasive effort to be egoless and level-headed. Working at Asana makes you feel like you're really a part of something special. On a simpler note: the perks and benefits at Asana are amazing. I mean, we have have our own culinary team that cooks 3 very healthy & delicious meals per day to make sure employees are healthy and nourished. This is just one example of the way Asana values its employees; they think about people holistically. Further, the work/life balance is great and you really get the time and focus to think about the work you're doing in a meaningful way. Asana is really a diamond in the rough, and I personally feel super lucky to work there.","Other reviews have mentioned this as well, but an intimidating thing about working at Asana is the level of empowerment and independence you have. The buck stops with you. You are responsible for working with your team to develop great ideas and execute on them. This is not your creative director or manager's responsibility. I would argue that this is NOT a con, but a pro. However, this is one of the top things I've seen people struggle with (at least at the beginning).

These are things that Asana aspires to be (we may not get all the way there, but, all things considered, we get pretty close): A thriving business that's financially successful, but ultimately driven by its mission and values. A mindful culture where everyone can be themselves, communicate honestly even when it's difficult, and thrive as human beings. Where we push each other to do great things together, and each person is empowered to do so.

I feel so grateful to be surrounded by brilliant, passionate teammates who are deeply engaged in our work.","• I've heard people say that ""the hardest thing about being Asana is the empowerment."" We have an unusual culture where individual contributors get to make final decisions far more often that at most companies, and having the buck stop with you can be a source of real stress.

• The culture is very focused on honest communication. The honesty is paired with kindness and tact, but it still results in conversations that some people can find difficult or awkward, e.g. real talk about opportunities for improvement in a project or in your performance.","As the company scales, it will be increasingly tempting to lower the hiring bar, or to be less mindful in how we develop processes.

*People--Everyone that works here is both talented and social. I am still find it amazing that I thoroughly, genuinely appreciate every single person I meet here.

*Leadership-- Dustin and JR have built incredible products and incredible companies in the past. They know what they are doing. With Asana they are patient, and mindful to do what is best for the company and our mission. They focus on doing things right and building for long term success. (not to mention VCs).

*Product--As a Salesperson, we receive countless ""thank you for your amazing product"" a day. Really takes the ""selling"" out of the conversation.

*Business--Freemium product with millions of happy users and not a lot of strong competition. A lot of opportunity to define a market. We will see a lot more Freemium business models in the future, Asana offers an opportunity to learn the business early.

Not only do I get to help solve those problems, since we're friendly with those companies I get tons of exposure and connections to them.

* Each person gets a ton of responsibility. Even new grads get to be the leaders of their areas and make the big calls. That's not to say you won't hear lots of opinions and get lots of support, but we don't argue till everyone's exhausted. In general, the company really supports personal growth.

* We're one of the rare companies that has a viable business model and is still strongly focused on building a product customers love. Our sales model starts with teams choosing to use us for free, so we care a lot about great design and user experience - we're building a product we can all be proud of. And on top of that, we're making money - companies find us valuable and Asana can stay in business.

* The culture here is amazing. People genuinely care about each other and are nice. Everyone is really mindful and introspective, always thinking about how to improve things. People give honest feedback often, from a place of support and wanting to work well together. There are lots of different cross-functional extracurricular groups for things like soccer, board games, going out for dinner, and various diversity groups.","* People are really eager to try new things. Sometimes we skip the obvious time-tested way of doing things and create our own way, which will end up having it's own problems.

* We're working through some growing pains with communication and involvement.

2017-01-18, User Operations,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",Current Employee ,Best Job I've Ever Had,More than a year,0,"Mindfulness is a buzzword at a lot of companies right now, but Asana is genuinely committed to making sure that people have a good work/life balance, and I think that people here really believe that this balance promotes productivity rather than hindering it. I've never worked somewhere where it honestly feels like so many people are contributing to building something bigger together, and not just that they're fighting to have an individual contribution recognized while keeping their head above water. A lot of that is represented in the product itself - since we're all using Asana every day we're geared towards collaboration in a way that I think is rare.

After being here over a year I still really believe in the product, in the business strategy the company is pursuing, and in my colleagues too.","As with most tech companies, there's a very flat structure which can make progression feel difficult or opaque, and a certain amount of initiative is required in finding interesting projects to work on. If you're comfortable with expanding your skills and have a manager who is sensitive to these needs though, it's much less of a problem.","As we grow bigger it's important to think about how we can encourage progression and retention. With more teams there's more room to transfer laterally, but with greater specialization it's also harder to do effectively! This is especially important in remote offices. Progression needs to be meaningful too - title changes with little or no shift in responsibilities can cause more problems then they solve.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2016-03-11, User Operations Specialist,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",Current Employee ,A new world of work was opened up to me!,Less than a year,0,Asana has created a culture of inclusivity and openness. You can bring 100% of your quirkiness to the table and it will be embraced. Communication is honest and open. Remote offices are included in the day to day of the parent office as much as is humanly possible and senior management have their finger on the pulse!,Not a huge opportunity for progression in remote offices but this is balanced with development opportunities and education.,Keep doing what you're doing and don't ever stop!,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0
2016-02-12, Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,Fantastic Company!,,0,"The best thing about Asana for me are the people. Not only is everyone world class at their craft, but they are also exceptionally kind and mindful. Our culture is truly unique. Leadership is extremely transparent and information is shared freely- e.g. we receive monthly updates about the state of our business and finances. It's super gratifying to build a tool that helps so many teams around the world. Our business is very healthy and we're growing quickly. ...and we have amazing perks!","Sometimes it's hard to figure out how responsibilities are shared and distributed. While we care about diversity a lot, at the moment we hardly have any employees over the age of 35, let alone 40.

Also, I'm ruined for life. I'm not sure if I'll ever enjoy work as much anywhere else.",Please continue to keep the culture alive as we're scaling.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
