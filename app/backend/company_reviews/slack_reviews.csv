2018-11-12,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,External Perception Outpacing Reality,More than 3 years,0,"• Extremely strong, once-in-a-lifetime business. From a market perspective, there's no reason Slack can't be the next MSFT/Salesforce. MSFT presents some competition in the space, but it's Slack's market to lose. You definitely have job security here.
• Compensation and perks are great. Fitness reimbursement, education, phone data, etc. You'll save a lot of money by working here. Office spaces are luxurious and thoughtfully designed.
• You get to work on a product (many!) people actually use and care about
• There are some truly extraordinary people working here that are a pleasure to work with and learn from.
• Stewart is as ""unique"" and inspiring as he seems from the outside. Some other executives are the same way.
• Slack is no longer a startup so it's less likely you'll need to work startup hours (e.g. 9a - 5p will swing it for most roles)
• The bar for tech companies is lower than sea level, but Slack is still above it. From a total package perspective, there are few opportunities as good as this in Silicon Valley, even despite its many flaws.","• Despite Slack's diversity PR, some women and minorities still experience horrible things/sexism/lesser treatment there just like any other tech company. There's more than one case of a perpetrator not only not being punished because of incidents but being promoted. Internal surveys continually reflect the dissatisfaction from URMs and virtually nothing is done. It feels awful when the company is telling a story externally that is divorced from the realities many employees experience internally.
• Senior leadership is extremely hit or miss. You're as likely to find inspiring leaders as you are to find people solely focused on building their personal brand/driving readership to their blog instead of doing any real work.
• There are management chains completely devoid of accountability, where a bad manager reports to and is close with a bad manager who reports to and is close with a bad manager… This is as demoralizing for direct reports/peer managers as it sounds.
• Your Slack experience is highly dependent on which department/team you're a part of e.g. someone in CE or Design is much more likely to report having a far better experience than someone in Marketing or Product, but it also varies highly from team to team within each department. Do your due diligence on the team you're joining.
• The monolith of a codebase has finally caught up to product/engineering. Everyone's heard about the recent weeks' long code freeze but development velocity has indeed slowed to a snail's pace. With more and more large enterprise customers coming in, a rumored IPO, etc, it's unlikely this will turn around in any substantial way. This is extremely tough if you work in Product/Design/Engineering.
• Slack's culture is ""too nice"" — people tend to be passive-aggressive and avoid difficult conversations/feedback. Poor performers who make it past 3-6 months are almost never managed out. The foundational values of the company like Empathy/Courtesy were well-intentioned but not fully thought out and the consequences can be felt now.
• The reward for doing well is typically being driven to burnout — many high performing employees are barely making it to their 2 or 3 year marks, let alone 4 years or beyond.","Splash cold water on your face, take a look in the mirror, and start seeing what you actually are.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

* Company has a good name and is on a good trajectory.

Mid-managers come up with rubrics for judging advancement, but use vague definitions to make assessment fit their view. In two years, among fifteen colleagues, I've observed perhaps three IC promotions (manager class seems to promote itself)
* In same vein, mid-management is reluctant to promote ICs to management, tend to hire from outside so nearly impossible to move up from IC to mgr
* Fast growth issues: getting things out the door is focused on, so quick wins are praised and rewarded, while building scalable solutions is often overlooked. Result is a lot of tech debt and even basic data questions still take a long time to get answered. On an org level, code base is a behemoth and we've now finally been forced into clean-up mode because it's struggling to scale.","* Quick and dirty is fine at a small start-up but it's time to start focusing on some scalable solutions. That doesn't just mean implementing them from the top down but building a culture where going the extra mile to build a good solution is rewarded.

The product has serious issues, but if you bring them up along with possible solutions, you manager will not be happy and tell you that these issues are not our concern because a different team is responsible for the feature in question. There is no sense of urgency. The company is very successful, but resting on your laurels is an invitation to competitors to eat your lunch. The product does not scale well on the server-side. The word ""proactive"" is not in anybody's dictionary. We're all waiting for fires to fight. Teams are poorly organized.

I feel lucky to sell a product that is genuinely loved by our users. It’s inspiring to see how our customers embrace Slack to transform how they work.

Marketing leadership has been allowed to drive the morale down of the marketing team. The marketing organization is a hot bed of opaque transparency, silencing tactics, favoritism, unannounced informal demotions, bullying tactics including just deciding to stop inviting key people to meetings, silent treatment and coverups, poor operational procedure, lack of vision, lack of insight into decision making with with no oversight from our CEO. The culture amp survey scores for the entire org are in material decline, and there is a consistent show of sloppy vision from the top that keeps marketing operations in a state of confusion with constantly blown scopes and massively off track projects, thrashing and things changing every other week. Attrition is bad people who don't get bullied out of the organization are starting to leave on their own accord.

The People Org has watched all of this go on and it continues to happen with seemingly very few alarm bells being rung . The morale of the marketing organization is in serious decline and many key figures have gone missing with very little explanation. Leadership has been allowed to run amuck and people are too paralyzed by unchecked power and are too fearful to disagree because they know the consequences—their careers. There is no recourse for you if you are a victim of leaderships quick disposal of you. Everyone in the organization sees this pattern and it is an open secret.

The marketing organization has been tasked with a lot of meaningful company goals and the insecure, inhumane, bullying tactics are going to be the make or break in the entire team’s success. There are very talented people on the team and talented people have been forced out if they pose a threat or challenge leadership. Making a mistake can ruin your career. At the top of the organization is leadership is only about itself and its career aspirations and it does not care about who it has to step on, ruin or use to get there as long it keeps favor in our CEO's eyes.","Stewart, our CEO, should step in and stop this bleeding, and listen to the people who are on the front lines and doing the work to bring his vision to life, and stop the harm that is happening throughout the marketing organization at Slack before an eventual reckoning happens. Marketing leadership is a toxic force at the top and it is only a matter of time before it has to be dealt with. People are afraid and scared for their jobs and many tears have been shed over this.

Very smart, motivated, and passionate employee base.","I feel like I'm watching Death of a SaaS salesman play out right before my eyes. We have an amazing product, an amazing opportunity...lots of pipeline...yet it's nearly impossible to make real money. Why? Because commission rates are at the absolute bottom of the market. If you've been accustomed to a typical SaaS commission rate of 10%...you will NOT find that here...not even close. At Slack, your commission rate will be at 3% or less. Yes, it's true... if you close a $1M deal, you will only get paid about $30K before taxes.

It's unclear whether this is a CEO driven philosophical shift in not rewarding the revenue generators of the company or whether it's because Slack sales mgmt has come from non-enterprise sales roles at companies or channels where they have historically underpaid sales people (ie. DropBox, SFDC Commercial/SMB, LinkedIn etc)... but it's become a shock that has rippled through our sales org at the cost productivity.

Most of the team is still new enough and not vested enough to feel the grip of golden handcuffs (RSUs/Stock Options)... we WILL leave.

A $3M quota number with a $100K variable is bottom of the market. The average SaaS AE's Bookings:Earnings ratio is about 6:1...at Slack it averages about 15-20:1. Something HAS to change. If not, I expect significant attrition in the coming months.",2.0,,,,,

- Ratio of junior to senior engineers is higher here than elsewhere, resulting in ample stress for the senior engineers as they try to manage technical debt. For the juniors, the result is fewer opportunities for mentorship and a feeling of floundering without a life vest.

-Nice sense of team camaraderie - plenty of team bonding events, CEO is very accessible, upper management takes time to get to know everyone (not just by name).
- Despite being a younger company without the benefits of ""structured"" development plans, it is apparent that managers care about the career trajectory of employees, and how to bring out the best in each person.
-The general climate is not loud, and people are truly empathetic and respectful of the shared space. Strong, CEO supported effort to ensure that everyone is valued, regardless of function (none of the engineers vs sales or contractors vs FTE etc etc politics that can occur).","- Company is growing very fast. It's an exciting time, but that also means that the future state could be very different than the environment today. It is definitely a challenge to maintain the quality as the company scales.
- Not the place to be if you need a lot of direction or cannot handle ambiguity. Also not the place to be if you are easily frustrated, as the pace of work and of the ""asks"" changes often. The project you are working on needed to be done yesterday, and when you do finish it today, there is a chance that people are already moved on to the next thing or want done differently.
- Might be challenging at lower levels if you are not young/ flexible with work hours. People love what they do, and will work to get ""it"" done, which can mean longer than typical ""tech"" days.

2017-04-17, Senior Software Developer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Love it here, don't see myself leaving.",More than a year,0,"I joined Slack as a Senior Software Engineer working on mobile in late 2014 when there were about 70 employees. Now, 2.5 years later, there are over 700 (maybe even 800?). Scaling a company that rapidly is chaotic and challenging, but having worked at other places who came out of that process with a bad culture and poor management, I continue to be impressed with the thoughtful way Slack management has scaled the company. Not every decision that's been made has been correct, but my experience has been that management is very open to feedback and willing to iterate on processes or change them completely when we can see that they aren't working.
One thing we are known for outside the company is diversity & inclusion, and my personal experience has been very positive in that regard, though as a white woman my perspective is limited.
We do compensation audits and adjustments every 6 months, both market rate adjustments as well as performance based raises, and I've been very happy with that process. Hard to be mad about getting a raise every 6 months without having to ask for it.
The work life balance has been in my experience excellent. On the walls it says ""work hard and go home"" and throughout the 4 managers I've had in my time here I have never felt pressured to work late or work weekends to meet a deadline. We've responded to missed deadlines with retrospectives about our planning and estimation process, rather than blaming engineers or anyone else.
There's a lot more I could talk about, but I hope this is a helpful glimpse into what it's like working here. My experience isn't universal, and as an earlier employee I probably have some measure of privilege that I can't see clearly at the moment, but I see myself here for years to come and can't imagine leaving unless there are dramatic changes in management (like if Stewart and Cal left).","Because of how fast we have been growing, it can get a little chaotic sometimes. There have been projects that have been 95% complete and then changed by management at the last moment, causing frustration and extra work for engineers. We are still learning how to most effectively communicate at this scale.
There can sometimes be a tendency to be self-congratulatory for how, compared to other tech companies, we are more diverse etc. This is called out pretty rapidly when it happens, as it should be because we have a lot of work to do still.
As management has said before internally, Slack Is A Distracting Menace. Working at a company full of Slack power users means that it can be hard to get work done without developing excellent focus skills.","Continue staying open to feedback from ICs. Fight hard against the temptation to rest on our laurels when it comes to D&I. Work hard to continue sourcing high quality, diverse candidates, even if it takes longer to fill a position.

- Opportunity, not just as an individual contributor, but as an organization. We're solving interesting problems and are redefining the way people work and communicate every single day. It's nuts.
- Leadership is incredible. These are people who have storied careers and know what it takes for a company to be successful in the long term. Decisions make sense. There really is transparency, which is a word a lot of Silicon Valley companies throw around but don't actually honor, and accessibility. You can DM or approach any of our C-level executives with anything and actually get a thoughtful response. Again, it's nuts.
- People care about each other so much. SO much. I've never had so many people invested in seeing me grow and succeed, people who aren't even on my team or even members of my organization. Like... what? How do they even know who I am?
- There's actual work life balance. It's another thing that a lot of companies tout, but Slack means it when they say they want you to work hard and go home. People have families and hobbies and gym memberships and friends and none of that has to go by the wayside or be sacrificed in favor of putting in 12 hours at their desks.
- My coworkers humble and inspire me every day. These are multitalented, accomplished, brilliant folks, some of whom are truly thought leaders, and I feel so fortunate to have the opportunity to work alongside them. I can't stress enough how much I've learned.

I can't even keep track of the number of bad days I've had at Slack. This review is not for the company at a whole, but for a specific department. You are extremely over worked and under appreciated. You get threatened that you'll get fired or put on a pip, you never know when you need to tip toe around something or if you should be assertive and make decisions. You get blamed for every mistake, and are criticized for not being the most cheerful and positive person on the planet. You get yelled at and you will cry. You will share your feelings with your colleagues, and they will stab you in the back. You will try to open up, and see that those messages have been shared with someone else. All in all, this is a stressful, emotional and political place to be. A lot of changes have been made recently, and maybe there is hope at the end of the tunnel.","Be careful who you have leading the culture front. You've made progress by removing a key piece that was running it to the ground. You'll notice that the more you preach certain values, the more people expect others to uphold it 100% of the time. And lets be honest, we're all human, and you can't expect that. People are allowed to make mistakes, to have bad days, and to be human. Whats important is how you help them through it.

Dublin (Ireland)",Current Employee ,Hypergrowth adventure ride,More than a year,0,"Slack for me is the best of two worlds: the excitement of a true startup, but with the financial stability of a large company that comes from having hundreds of millions of investment in the bank. This provides an environment of ceaseless forward momentum and opportunity to stretch yourself.
There is not only an opportunity to put your stamp on things, but a necessity, as small teams try to achieve what is normally done by groups ten times their size at other companies.
In general, your leadership will give you wide latitude and trust to get the job done as you see fit.
If you are ambitious about your career, Slack is an open road.","Many people feed off the energy of a startup environment. If you don't, however, and instead seek stability and predictability, Slack will probably not be the dream employer for you. As a company that has achieved more in four years than other top tier tech companies have in ten years, change is constant here.

If you have come from a large company like Google or FB, learning and development will feel different than what you are used to. You will find very little structured, classroom-style learning here, but you will learn on the job through being afforded opportunities to do things you otherwise wouldn't. Some may find this a little daunting.","More emphasis can be put on living our culture - managing by our values, rewarding exceptional acts of embodying them and admonishing deviating from them.",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
