Internal promotions seems to be based on tenure, not talent. The tenured cloudreachers promoted to the “Leader” roles are protective of the company and not their people.

There are some genuinely smart, talented technical people working here, though with the state of things it's hard to say how long they'll stay.","If you're looking to truly grow in your career, look elsewhere. Inexperienced and unqualified people sit in business-critical and leadership roles in the company, lacking any real training or guidance in how to effectively lead teams and grow their team members. Often times it feels like people are just ""winging it"" and learning as they go how to lead teams, often at the expense of their people.

All of the diversity and inclusion efforts are very shallow and surface level to give the company a good image and don't address the real, internal issues and work environment. Examples of official, company sponsored events include binge drinking on a party bus and an all-you-can drink company-wide kickoff event in Mexico. Are we the most innovative cloud computing company in the business, or a bunch of college kids on spring break? As if being a woman in a mainly male tech company isn't challenging enough, Cloudreach throws a bunch of alcohol into the mix and makes it even more inhospitable.","What this company really needs is to seriously mature and think about the type of environment it provides for it's employees, and what that message sends about who belongs here.

2018-08-31,,,Former Employee ,A very disappointing experience,A very disappointing experience,0,for the most part the people are nice and willing to work with you. they have cloudy lunch every Friday. It's definitely an engineering heavy company but not much of a sales org. I believe the new CEO will be a positive person to bring much needed change.,"I think Cloudreach is two very different companies if you compare them in the UK and the US. I saw too much leadership in the US leave very quickly, which is disconcerting. I saw two sales manager and a channel manager quit within a period of 4-5 months. They hired a CMO and he only stayed for 2 months. I saw a few sales people quit in a short period of time as well. I experienced a total lack of support for the sales org. There's not much of a marketing dept to help generate demand, I didn't see that the channel managers worked successfully with AWS & Azure to where they were willing to proactively cooperate with the sales org. AWS & Azure expected Cloudreach to bring them deals and Cloudreach expected the same out of them. AWS told partners that they expected them to have their own demand gen, marketing, events and activities to generate business and Cloudreach just does not have these capabilities yet. I was met with a lot of resistance any time I wanted to do an event or activity to generate demand. The comp plan is demotivating. You have to book all of your trips on your own credit card and I personally had several issues in being paid on time and correctly, which is very stressful. The company does not reimburse for lunches. This adds up quickly when you're an outside rep and are constantly traveling for business. This point was brought up to management many times and nothing was ever done about it.
 I think many of these issues are due to the fact that the company is working towards accelerating its growth and they don't quite have the right management and procedures to sustain this growth.","Sustainable growth is key to ensuring employee retention and morale. Listen to your people as they have your best interest in mind. I'm excited for all the growth the company is working towards but if your average employee tenure is 1.5 years or less, you'll have a hard time sustaining this growth.

Access to cloud solution providers at a high level.","Two words: expenses and corporate cards. The company calls on its consulting employees to travel quite a bit. This is expected; what's not expected is incurring many thousands of dollars in personal debt while awaiting reimbursement. This is actually a quite serious 'con' because it can mean stress and a degree of hardship caused by doing one's job and is a long ago solved problem for most other orgs in this space (it's a simple formula: corp AMEX, Concur, corporate rates for airfare, hotels and rental cars, etc.).","North American leadership: decisively address the expenses issue. There are talented people who're staying away from, or leaving Cloudreach - despite its many virtues - because it lacks a solid layer of consistent, professionalized logistical support for staff who're called upon to travel.

Male entitlement is rampant and loathsome; men get promoted into leadership roles after bro'in out over a few beers and fancy dinners. Cool bro. High five bro.
The offensively artificial communications and ridiculous illusion of transparency and honesty. The PR team are PUPPETEERS who spin the truth, evade tough questions, and cover up the dark secrets. Dance for us, puppets, dance!","Go back in time and don't sell to Blackstone. In all seriousness, i'm afraid things may be too far gone to offer advice at this point and the management team will just scoff at it, not daring to even consider a moment of self reflection. The company will continue exploiting and disappointing its employees while the leadership team chases their big exit. Once that happens, the executive team will collect a huge payout from their equity, go on a fancy vacation in st. maarten, send their kids to obscenely expensive boarding schools, and move on to other companies to do it all again. Meanwhile, the little people will be left behind, many without jobs, and only a memory of the company that they used to love that will cease to exist.

Before all goes up in flames you could also try hiring more women into leadership. Or just A woman. a single woman. not single like relationship-wise, but as in 1 woman.

We treat scaling a company like cooking pasta: throw a bunch of it at the wall and see what sticks. We're growing aggressively since becoming acquired by a massive private equity firm, but there is a huge misalignment between recruitment and the business. Recruitment only cares about hitting a massive target, which results in hiring tons of people who aren't the right fit.

Opinions and ideas are treated with respect, and feedback is taken seriously, with a good level of transparency in communication. Usually when a new service/process/etc. rolls out, feedback is requested and you can start to see changes and work based on that feedback very quickly.

I've been treated extremely well as a remote developer. Communication across the company often involves people from multiple offices, so keeping employees engaged is treated as a priority here. Good balance of travel, too.

Finally, unlimited vacation time! Time off and work-life balance is important here, and the minimum amount of PTO encouraged by the leadership team is more than many US companies offer even after years of employment there.","With smaller teams, large projects, and cutting-edge technology, things can get hectic. I like this aspect and have been able to adapt without much effort, but it's not for everyone.

If you're working out of an office, team get-togethers are often over drinks and/or meeting up after work. This can be tough to keep up with if you're not one to go out, or if you have a busy family life. I've never seen this become an issue with anyone here, and the culture is still welcoming in other ways, but it can be a turn-off for some.","- Keep on living up to the company values!

- The unlimited holiday scheme favours more the back office staff who are not directly critical to Cloudreach's billing as opposed to the Engineering consultants at the battlefront on customer sites.

- Another con working for Cloudreach is how slow change is enacted. Any policy change that favours the employees or intelligent enough to boost the company’s industrial prowess takes forever to come into fruition (See Software and Benefits above).

- Endemic corruption due to poor organisation processes or a wilful circumvention of the process in place by people in management who are used to sweeping decisions/transactions under the carpet.

Despite huge growth targets, the company continues to invest in regular offsites to bring global staff together (almost all expenses paid), welcoming office spaces with plenty of supplies, food, drink etc, and a dedicated Learning and Development team to promote career development culture.

Comments suggesting it is becoming a bodyshop are very misleading as this is very much not the case. We have been told there will be a big focus in the coming 6 months on career development for technical roles, as well as plans for how to win more innovative exciting work. There is always change in a growing company, but the things that really matter are not changing (the focus on treating people well).

The people are great. Anyone who’s interviewed here knows it’s hard, and we get it right on the whole.
That means smart, energetic people who want to make sh*t happen, in all parts of the business. I love that. That energy and drive needed to grow and adapt year and year isn’t seen in most companies. I've met a lot of people here I regard as friends, which is the best indicator perhaps of cultural fit.

Linked to the people, I love the culture. People are friendly, and the company tries hard to foster matrix relationships - with cloudy lunches, quarterly/kick off trips, birthday parties, etc all frequent and way more inclusive than one sees at other organisations. I saw some comments last weeks that most companies have “sales kick offs”. We take the whole company, which I think is critical to our culture.

On the “work” side, I enjoy the fact we have a pretty broad spread of clients across multiple industries, and of all shapes and sizes. I also love that we are success, and continue to be the leaders in most things that we do.

Salary and benefits are pretty good - increasing year on year, although we’re not quite there vs. a multi-billion dollar “GSI” yet - but equally, this is a much more pleasant and dynamic place to work - in my view, pretty much free of the politics and nonsense you see elsewhere.","Is it hard work, as others have noted? It certainly can be. That’s what happens when you grow a company, but I feel we’re doing it in the “right” way - e.g. if I can’t do something due to time and flag that up, it’s fine.
No one stays late to impress their boss - but they may work late because they care about achieving something. The working arrangements are pretty flexible I should say, depending on whether you’re with a client or not.
Having said that, it’s not for everyone. If you want to work somewhere relatively static, and with clear well documented processes, that’s not here right now. Cloud is red hot, and we’re growing fast as we capitalise on this (before someone else does).

Linked to that growth, people do (accidentally) step on each other’s toes a bit in terms of remit currently. That’ll settle down as the roles bed in, but you should bear it in mind if you prefer a really clean and well documented role vs. other people.

I don’t recognise the issues being written previously - makes me wonder sometimes if it’s another company they’re writing about accidentally (or intentionally!), but at 500 people, I guess we can’t all know each other well. What I do know is that I’ve spoken to several of the leadership team, from Pontus down, and all are committed to making/keeping this a great place to work - so please do shout up to one of them, they can probably help with whatever challenges you can see. Claiming that CloudreachCares doesn’t exist (as an example) was one thing I read last week. That’s utter BS - we’ve given thousands in both monetary and time commitments to charity. I agree the suggestion process could be clearer and maybe we need to be more transparent in terms of what’s been given, but just “get involved” rather than posting some bile on the internet. It’s easy to solve, like most things in life, with a conversation.","- Be more transparent about initiatives that are underway already

Some of the best pros I would like to mention:
- The people - everyone is very friendly, smart, helpful, positive. Really great people and you will enjoy working with the team
- Quarterly meetings - 2 smaller local events (But still great ones) and 2 of the quarterlies usually involves flying to secret location (Barcelona, Mallorca, Lisabon, Boston, Chicago, Whistler, Harrison hot springs - just to name the ones during my stay here)
- Uncapped vacation - how cool is that, you can take as much days off as you want (But not take a year off obviously:)
- Great office locations - always in the city centre of big cities like Vancouver, New York, London, Chicago, Edinburgh, Dallas, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris to name the main ones. Also lots of opportunities to visit other offices, or even relocate if that's what you wish for (Many many people have relocated to their dream city thanks to working in Cloudreach)
- The offices are cool, they all look pretty, modern, with things like pool table, foosball, beanbags etc. Also lots of beer, snacks, lunching out every Friday. You will get nice Mac, 2 big screens, nice phone (choose pixel or iphone in Vancouver)
- Career opportunities - it really is up to you how would you like to shape your career. I worked at 3 different positions during the 3 years and all you need to do is to show interest and prove you got what it takes to take the new position. Many people are also switching between departments and relocating to different cities if that's their career goal. You will have your line manager who will do their best to help you to progress your career the way you want to.
- The management - everyone is very friendly and very open, including the management. James and Pontus started this company and have done amazing job growing it. They are as transparent as they can, they are not shy to share the revenue numbers and growth plans. There are regular meetings focused on such a updates.
- The growth - Blackstone recently invested their money in Cloudreach and one of the goal of this investment is a massive growth of CR - more offices, more people. This also means more career opportunities for the employees and more options for relocation if that's something you are interested in
- No overtime is expected or required - great work life balance. If you want to be top engineer, you may need to spend some time outside of work studying for certifications or improving your skills in certain technologies, but that's not expected, it's your choice.",- The ops team supports many many customers who are using many different technologies and build various applications - this may be overwhelming for some people and you should be ready to learn a lot and grasp new things quickly.,You are doing great work to keep Cloudreach amazing place to work for.

2017-03-01, Operations,"Edinburgh, Scotland (UK)",Former Employee ,[Not a robot] - My time in Cloudreach was Invaluable,[Not a robot] - My time in Cloudreach was Invaluable,0,"All of what you hear are the good parts of Cloudreah are 100% true. Also, for context I worked within Cloud Operations for almost 3 years. I have learned, traveled and experienced so much over my time in employment and I certainly would not hesitate it as a new place to work for anyone looking to shift into Cloud technologies.

There are parts for improvement, which I will mention in a moment, however, ultimately: the people are great to work with, the customers are great to work with, the workload is varied and changing regularly (you will be hard placed to find one day that is the same as the next - depending on your role) and the offices are well looked after and open plan (with plenty of free things if you are looking for that, coffee + misc drinks, snacks, continental breakfast assortments etc).

If your are looking to confirm whether what the recruitment team tells you about is true or not, it is definitely is, and then some.

However, in addition, the values you are indoctrinated with do certainly ring true also, they are definitely not brought up at. every. freaking. opportunity for no good reason. You can feel things like approachability and respect from almost everyone you meet (irrespective of the region you work in!) - that said, Edinburgh is the best office to be in (no subjectivism what so ever...)","I would bare in mind at this point that the highs out weigh the lows, and there are a few lows. However, I would say also that even when I was leaving, the lows that I had to report back appear to all have a plan in place for improving them already (the company is able to adapt quickly to problems it or others identify and report).

So, with that in mind:

- Certain teams need to expand, in terms of business justification, I am sure said teams would be able to present a fair amount of justification per function for such an increase.

- The HR team are much better than when I started almost 3 years ago, and based on my exit interview it does seem as though things will be quickly improving from new roles, initiatives that have been implemented etc. However, until such changes are implemented, I would say the previous HR points raised within other reviews 'did ring true' through my earlier life in Cloudreach.

- Business strategy and initiatives can change fast and often, this can be seen in a good or bad light as clearly, with Cloudreach's success, this agile approach to strategy is working. However, it can be a bit disconcerting from quarter to quarter.

All of that said, I would still also highlight that, although I cannot comment on the future. As Cloudreach have now been acquired by Blackstone. There is certainly an opportunity to iron out any of my points or the points raised in previous reviews quickly and with much greater momentum.","Stay the corse you are on as it is working!

It's probably the best company you'll ever work for. Why ?

Not just the benefits. Those are great. Not the twice yearly company holidays , which are also cool. Nor the friday free lunches , or the flexible working environment (where possible) , where you can work remotely if you want to and your project allows it. The chances to work abroad in one of the ever-expanding list of offices are cool too. Visiting New York, Buffalo, Niagra Falls, Long Island, Mallorca and Amsterdam all in the space of a year is pretty nice as well. These are all awesome things that make it an enjoyable place to work.

You get to work with the worlds biggest companies, on projects that you'll be proud to have been part of. Using technologies that are in demand, and to develop your own contributions to them. You'll design mammoth migration projects, implement amazing scripting, and help scale systems used by millions of people worldwide.

And the rate you learn at is insanely good. Skilling up and certifications are heavily encouraged at all levels of the business. There is a large pool of very talented colleagues who back you up when you are on a project and are happy to help you learn and grow further. The continued expansion of the company (the London office has more than doubled in size in the last twelve months, 2 new offices in Chicago and Zurich opened recently) provides a lot of varied opportunities for advancement and development.

But what makes it the best company is one very simple fact. Cloudreach cares about you. The know you are a person who has a life outside work. And inside work, they want to do everything they can to make it a place you love to work. They ask you if you are ok with taking a project that might mean travelling beforehand. They ask you if you are happy with a project, with how it's going, with what it requires from you.

And then, importantly, they'll act on it. If you aren't happy with something, and they can improve it, they will do. The resourcing team works very hard to match projects to your personality, skills and interests (where possible), so you'll often be doing things you enjoy in the locations you want to do it in. If you want to travel a lot, they'll try and find projects involving travel for you. If you really don't , they'll try and fit that in too.

Joining Cloudreach was easily the best decision I ever made. I don't just enjoy my job. I love it.","It's very difficult to think of any - some growing pains as the company expands, but these are quickly addressed as time goes on.","Keep it up!

- Cloudreach hire smart people. They're also friendly and interesting. This makes it a fun and enjoyable place to work. Not seen a particular type of problem before? No worries, throw enough smart people at it and we can make it happen.

- We have great relationships with the major cloud vendors, and a big long list of happy customers.

- Projects and technologies are interesting.

- Cloudreach are well positioned and have a sensible strategy to support larger organisations.

- Events and quarterlies are spectacular.

- The expansion has been incredible, roughly doubling every year. It's been a great ride, and long may it continue. Working for a growing company provides career opportunities for all.

Global domination awaits.","The cons get eroded all the time. A few years back, perhaps our benefits were a bit 'tight', as was typical of a small company focused on growth. These days that's no longer true and we're leading on benefits like uncapped holiday.

It's worth noting that the fun of working in a growing company does of course have some counter-balance in that there's always a *lot* to be done. I enjoy that, but not everyone would. Everyone at Cloudreach is busy!

There is some serious talent working here. What's more - there's not a single person who I'd not gladly have a beer with after work. Cloudreach would rather not hire for a role than hire someone who will be difficult to work with or who is just ""good enough"". The bulk of my team is based in London (i'm in Scotland), but I don't ever feel ""left out"" - we communicate daily via Google Hangouts.

Caring company: Despite the challenges of fast growth, I do feel like the Cloudreach is making a real effort to make it a great place to work. The benefits are relatively good - especially the ""little things"" like free sit-down meal on Fridays, good parties, fresh fruit and drinks/snacks.

Good Management: the management team are pretty good at communicating what our goals should be, and giving us advice on how to achieve them.

Development: Everyone is actively encouraged to get trained up and gain certifications. I have gained 4 certifications since starting 3.5 months ago. My Salesforce team is really helpful and supportive helping teammates prep for exams - and I think it's the same for the AWS and Google Apps teams.","I sometimes think that the fast expansion in the realms of recruitment can leave potential recruits feeling a bit up-in-the-air. My own recruitment process, while swift once it finally properly got going, involved a lot of chasing and unanswered emails initially. I recommended a couple of friends to work at Cloudreach as well - one was hired quite swiftly, but the other got a fair ways into the recruitment process before losing out to another candidate. However, he wasn't informed that the role was filled despite numerous querying emails, which was a bit embarrassing for me after having raved to him about what a great place Cloudreach is to work. My advice would be to improve communication with recruits - even if it's just a quick email to say ""thanks for the email, we have no news as yet"" or ""thank you, you were great but we've found someone more qualified"". It's not a nice feeling to be left hanging for a job you really want.

Working hours are also quite long - I'm still adjusting to the 9-6 working day. Coupled with a lower-than-industry-standard remuneration, I wound up getting a lower hourly rate at Cloudreach than at my previous role, despite a higher annual salary. It's been worth it for the great culture, however.","Keep on keeping it cloudy!

The people are amazing, the job is amazing, the management is just perfect and cloud computing is currently so hot that there is nothing more one can wish for!

To address one of the negative review below: ""Cloudreach is cheap on every way possible"".

From my experience Cloudreach is not cheap at all for the following reasons:

- In total (including statutory holidays), you will get 34 days of vacation per year - plus extra ona day for every 1 year of employment, up to 5 extra days (talking about Canada) - probably not many other companies offers that many vacation

- Yearly kick of meeting in a great location (Barcelona last year, Mallorca this year) - around 150 people attending, Cloudreach pays for everything - I don't consider this as cheap!

- Another 3 bigger events during the year (4 days in whistler this March all inclusive for employees including ski passes, go carting twice a year and another local events)

- Cloudy lunch every Friday when company goes to a nice local restaurant as a team

- There is always food in the fridge and cupboards as well as lots of beers!

- Cloudreach offices are very centrally located, in the downtown of cities like Vancouver, London, New York, Munich, Paris, Amsterdam and Edinburgh - If Cloudreach would be cheap they will find a cheap country for their offices! There are people always traveling between offices and after some time there will be definitely the opportunity to visit your colleagues in a different country

Hope one will understand that Cloudreach is not as cheap as it looks like from the negative feedback:)

Also to address ""Terrible communication"" - Cloudreach management is very open and is giving detail business insides every few months, coming directly from the founders. HR is busy, that is true as Cloudreach is looking to fill maybe 50 positions at any given time, so HR could be slower to respond, but it never happened that my questions will not be answered. Also every employee has assigned a team lead and they have 1on1 meetings every 2 weeks discussing any technical/personal development, so I really don't see any lack of communication anywhere, it is the opposite, everyone is very friendly and every employee has the opportunity to openly talk if something is not right.

Another point from the negative feedback: ""They will push you to accept bad employment terms in order to stay employed"" - of course Cloudreach is not pushing anyone to accept anything. It is up to the individual to decide whether he/she wants to work for Cloudreach or not. If the employment terms are bad for the individual, of course he/she can decide not to sign the offer and look elsewhere!","The only cons from my point of view is that the salary range could be a little higher (talking about Canada), but again, as a whole package the terms are fair",Keep doing what you are doing and everyone will be happy! :),5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
