There's a lot of fun to be had, especially at first, and extra especially if you work in a corporate/Home Office role, where a lot of these perks are focused. Also, the hospitality industry tends to attract kind, down-to-earth, warmhearted people. I met a lot of them in my travels to the various locations in the field.","The basic corporate infrastructure (IT, finance, even HR) features a lot of legacy people and processes held over from at least a generation ago. There seems to be a widespread belief that operating a high-profile sector of a multinational corporation just like a paper-and-pencil family business is viable. The going mythology is that there's no budget to upgrade IT, finance, training, etc., but on the other hand, there does seem to be plenty of money for a lot of frivolous nice-to-haves (again, mostly for the corporate staff). The word ""nice"" is used heavily among upper management - along with ancillary concepts like ""fun"" and ""family"" - and the expectation is that everyone loudly participate in and propagate the message that it's a nice, fun family. That didn't square with my experience - this is actually the most stressed and hopeless I've ever felt in a job - and the cognitive dissonance ultimately took an unsustainable toll on me.","Define yourselves as an organization: Are you a warmhearted people-first mom and pop shop, or a chew-you-up-and-spit-you-out corporate overlord?

I have never been in a more disrespectful or unorganized work environment in my life, and hope to never be again. No/little communication, which led to a lot of misunderstandings. If there was an issue, you were either spoken to about it directly in a very threatening way or the manager would get someone else to say it to you, in one case even texting the person next to you (while you're all in the same room) to tell you later rather than them telling you themselves.
No oversight on set-up days other than delegating certain tasks. This resulted in jobs that could have been done in a day or two (or maybe even less) being done halfway or not at all and only being discovered on game days, where we only had a few hours to prepare. There was almost never enough time to prepare because these tasks could simply not be done in that short amount of time.

The ability to see pro games and concerts. Occasionally getting comp tickets.,"As a manager I am under paid and over worked. Summer is supposed to be down time at my NBA stadium...NOT!
I've been on the road for 10 weeks helping other properties with NASCAR, Indy Racing, Kentucky Derby, etc. 16 hour days are not uncommon during these trips. Little time for sleep and its compounded over you visit because you don't get days off. I had to travel back to my property only to work that evening. No travel time given. Per diem sucks...$25 per day. A local property expected me to travel 100 miles each way to help them. Wasn't gonna do it. Pay for my hotel then I will come. Of course they were too cheap.","Get a clue....you are killing your managers. My Director of Operations works less time than me.

 I really enjoyed working with my coworkers and immediate managers, the working environment was great.","In short I would never recommend working for Levy.

Upper level management was sexist, hypocritical and aloof.
Personnel files are poorly handled.
Problems are not easily resolved.
Paychecks were more than 2 days late three times in a calendar year.
Efforts never seemed appreciated.
The amount of paperwork I needed to complete on a daily/weekly basis was outrageous, unnecessary, and a waste of mine and other employees time.
Not a lot of options for career growth, mostly just lateral movement.
Budgeting restrictions made adequately staffing the venue difficult at times.","Upper level management needs to make more of an effort to establish a positive presence with the FOH staff.
Take employee comments and complaints seriously.
Consider a different management style other than Top-Down.

While it is an exciting environment and you get to meet a ton of new people the quality of life is low. Many of the manager's home lives are a ruin, if they even have a family left. I started as an hourly employee, was promoted into management and even received a promotion within management to 'senior' level. They justify the insane hours of work and forced travel requirements with bogus catch phrases. Often times the location level management is great and supportive, it is the regional and corporate level VPs and the environment they foster that is caustic.","I thoroughly believe the company is broken, they need to support their managers better, pay more & not expect robotic level output from real humans in need of real rest and relaxation.",2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0
