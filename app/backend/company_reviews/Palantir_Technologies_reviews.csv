Your co-workers will be smart, hard-working, and motivated.

There's a very small number of companies in the DC area that offer catered food 3 times a day and have a speakeasy. The perks are real, and while they shouldn't be a deciding factor, they're definitely nice.","I was hired as a ""Forward Deployed SOFTWARE Engineer"". During the interview process, I asked what the difference was between this and a normal software engineering position, and was told ""there's basically no difference"". That response was untrue. I was further misled at least twice during the interview process, and one of my interviews apologized for lying to me during interviews after we both had left the company.

Any type of forward deployed position at Palantir bears very little resemblance to a normal ""software engineering"" position. Some people like the differences and others don't. Forward deployed engineering involves mostly deploying other people's code of varying quality and trying to shoehorn it into a place to solve a problem, then struggling desperately to keep it running. Also, trying to keep other people's earlier shoehorned solutions running.

As of my departure in summer 2016, the DC office still has no real SE positions, though it does list them as openings. Be very cautious applying for one of these positions. I recommend asking every single person you talk to the following questions:
* If hired, what PRODUCT will I be working on? (they will probably try not to answer - you can interpret that response however you like)
* How many products are developed in this office, and where are they used? How big are the development teams?
* How many product managers are in the office?
* What does the development/release cycle look like for the product I will be working on?
* Will I be working on a client site? OR What are the travel requirements for this position?

Basically, try to ask very SE-specific questions about the job you're applying for. Be critical about analyzing the responses.

But seriously, if you want to do software engineering, do yourself a favor and don't go to work at Palantir in DC. London, New York, and Palo Alto all have supported and stable engineering teams as of summer 2016.

The company also suffers from systemic poor leadership, which creates a political, distrusting environment that said leadership refuses to believe exists. This isn't necessarily a dealbreaker though, just something to be aware of. I ranked culture & values low, because while Palantir has a great cultural manifesto, it's almost 100% not reflective of conditions inside the company.

Palantir has a culture of disrespecting customers, which made me uncomfortable.

Finally, there's definitely a subculture of people expecting employees to be in the office a lot. I think even people who are on site all the time suffer from a public perception that they're not ""spending enough time in the office"".","Stop hiring software engineers to not do software engineering.

Here you will have the opportunity to help the great organizations of the world do amazing things - change how modern aircraft are built, help research cures for cancer, fight human trafficking, or deploy with counterterrorism units to keep the world safe.

You will have the freedom of movement and execution to do whatever it takes to drive our work forward. Whether it is flying to the EU for a high stakes meeting to convert a major pilot, surging for 100 hour weeks in order to avert a client crisis, or facing a hostile skeptic that doesn't understand the value we bring. You decide your personal parameters as they relate to success and failure. Having seen much of the rest of corporate America, you will find no other organization that offers the wide latitude you will see here.

You will be surrounded by the smartest, most capable technologists and engineers in the world - who all genuinely want to leave an impact on the world - and they will rally to accomplish any task set in front of them without regard for self comfort or personal gain.

All of this comes at a price. See cons.","You will say goodbye to balance. In work (you will work harder than you ever have). In life (you will have little to none). In standards (you will hold yourself to the highest).

You will not be afforded the opportunity to coast.

You will not have your hand held.

You will be expected to produce results. Again and again. Project after project.

There will be times when you are physically and mentally exhausted when working something major, and you will want to throw in the towel - but you will look around and see that everyone else is feeling the same way - and you will either choose to press forward because you think what you're accomplishing is worth it, or you will reach for the white flag. See above about latitude of choice.

A small group of individuals will recognize these points as the price of admission into something greater than themselves.

The rest will choose to work on like buttons and taxi apps.",Improve external communication to fight the notion that we are some kind of secret cult.,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The engineering caliber is really strong, and I often feel like I'm surrounded by people who are smarter than me.

The work you do matters in a way that most tech work would not.
Palantir is a friendly, energetic, and collaborative environment where it's fun to be.
There's opportunity to work in places all around the world and travel basically as much as you want.
You'll be much more exposed to the business decisions and clients than you would in a typical software role. You'll learn a lot more than just software engineering.","It's really hard. You'll never be bored, but at times you'll be stressed, tired, and overwhelmed. You can't really be successful at Palantir with a 30-hour work week even if you could at a lot of other places. That's not for everyone, but for some it's not really a con.
There's a lot less structure/stability to the company than many people seek. It's constant chaos, which again for some people is fine, but definitely takes a certain kind of person.
You have to work on important things. At times that might be a technology you don't like, or it might not be coding at all. You can rest assured that there will be things to do, and they will matter, but it's harder to cherry-pick work based on tech. Even though there's plenty of mobility within the company, you might be most interested in something that doesn't exist at Palantir. Because the company is short on engineers and needs people focussed on the most important things, you can't hide in a corner on your own experimental research thing (unless you can show why it's valuable).",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Since your lead probably has significantly more work they'd like to get done than they actually can, if you demonstrate that you be trusted to prioritize, plan, and deliver without their involvement you will be given more and more autonomy, very rapidly.

Related to the above: very fast personal growth. Since there is so much more work than can actually get done, you can basically choose any kind of project you wish to work on, and change regularly. You can try out roles you wouldn't normally, and tackle problems in various industries.","A lot of employees have only worked at Palantir, we are having to re-discover best practices which are known at more mature companies. Although things have markedly improved in the last 9 months, and I think this is now broadly acknowledged. It took us a long time to understand how bad some of our development practices, PQE org, etc. were.

Not a con for me, but if you don't thrive in autonomous environments where you have to seek out your own mentorship opportunities, then in I would not recommend working here.

Leadership really is very inexperienced. I haven't observed it being terrible, since people are generally compassionate and certainly not malicious.

- The best idea is the only one that wins and if you are smart, dedicated, and flexible that concept can lead to you actualizing your full potential. These people do not pay normal corporate lip service to growth, they focus on it relentlessly. All you need to have is the courage to try, fail, and learn. Trust me, it is worth it. You will never be more challenged in your life.
- This is the only tech company that has real mission impact. If you want to sell billboards (aka if a business relies on ad revenue, guess what it is? A billboard company), drink smoothies, and work 9-5 every day, I'll save you some time. Don't work here. To be clear, our smoothies are quite awesome. However, Palantir is actually trying to solve the world's hardest problems, not just saying that to get recruits. That means you're going to have to be dedicated to crushing it. It'll be demanding but if you want your work to mean something, this is the place for you.","No cons. Just kidding :).
- Rapidly growing company = tons of volatility = tons of the usual growing pains.

- If you need to be told what to do... you probably shouldn't work here. Guidance usually only comes after you try something, self reliance is king.
- Rabid about transparency which means the whole place is like a firehose of information, which makes it very hard to navigate. Once you figure it out though, super easy to swim.","- Never forget our first principles.

I know people who are - literally - responsible for stopping terror attacks, uncovering financial crimes, shutting down cyber attacks, and rooting-out human trafficking rings. Do you? My co workers have built disaster recovery platforms that are being deployed globally, have turned the judicial system on its head with new investigative capabilities, have built and deployed the *only* functional down-range intelligence platform for our troops, and have turned around struggling commercial enterprises. They did it themselves, with little guidance, just like a start-up. They did it using (and building) some of the craziest, most amazing data tools you've ever even dreamed of. They did it faster than anyone else can, and they are just getting started. We are changing some of the biggest industries in the world: government, insurance, NGOs, CPG, retail, banking... the list goes on; and every year our horizon expands and we realize just how small we were dreaming the year before. What did you do last Tuesday?

At Palantir, words like 'meritocratic' and 'entrepreneurial' aren't techno-babble. I've never seen a place where someone with drive and passion and an ability to 'just go' can be so amazingly rewarded - not only with the material things, but also with the satisfaction that you've done something real, something meaningful. Results are rewarded here, and nothing is given.

Most positions at Palantir are a 'lifestyle job' - people feel the urgency in their work and, frankly, many of us work too hard.

* The office is small and feels like its own startup. We have all the perks of a large Silicon Valley company (free meals, fun activities, access to incredible problems and technology) and yet at the same time, it feels like we're this small underdog, fighting to make a difference against the entrenched powers and processes.
* The location is fantastic. We're 5 blocks from the beach, and try to get out there regularly. 1-on-1s mean walking along the bluffs overlooking the ocean.

Palantir in general has let me own really important problems, literally saving lives at times, and work with the smartest people I've ever gotten to work with.

2015-09-01, Forward Deployed Engineer,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Training ground for entrepreneurship,Training ground for entrepreneurship,0,"I've originally joined Palantir because I was intrigued by the FDE position and - more interestingly, considering the luxury of choices engineers have these days - it's the reason that keeps me working here.

As a FDE I get to work with a relatively small team (average around 5 people probably) on a project that's deemed critical to some of the biggest institutions in the world. That constellation (big problem, small team) comes with some interesting implications:

* You can't ""just"" be an engineer. Yes, there are really interesting technical problems that come with handling large-scale data and yes, you need to set up (and/or develop) the architecture that supports your team and the customer, but since there's so much to do you need to be able to wear lots of different hats. Engaging with the user and giving a demo, talking to IT teams and talking through the architecture or meeting C-level executives on a regular basis are all part of an FDE's responsibilities. I've always been very technical but having to respond to questions from non-technical CEOs has taught me how to hone ""soft"" skills that I consider immensely valuable (even beyond my career).

* You learn how to solve a problem. With the growth of the business it's becoming more and more common to be working in a vertical that's new to Palantir. This is really, really hard because you're coming up with a solution from scratch, but it's also really, really exciting and rewarding. You'll learn how to go from 0->1 (using Peter Thiel's words) and understand the difficulties and intricacies of starting something new (navigating through a jungle of uncertainty, finding the valuable thing, prototyping on it and iterating on feedback). I honestly think that this position is a great learning ground for future entrepreneurs.

* Your work actually matters. Palantir's customers are amongst the most important institutions in the world and we're always working on some of their biggest problems. Moreover, in a team of ~5 people the work you do has direct impact on the project. You make or break the project.

* Execution is critical, but you're also setting the vision. One of the rather amazing (and probably unique) things about Palantir is that it puts a lot of trust in and ownership on project teams. When you're working on a project, you're not just merely executing someone's plan, you're part of the team that's also defining the vision and the approach and is ultimately responsible for its success.","In a lot of respects Palantir is still a start-up (and in fact, it very much feels so when you're working on a project in a new vertical). That comes with a lot of benefits (as outlined above), but there are also some downsides:

* There's a lot of work. Palantir is certainly not a 9-5 job. People work long hours - I think ultimately this is because they care about what they do, but if having an easy schedule is important to you this is not the place for you.

* Things can break. There's traditionally not a lot of process in place and that can become a problem as the company grows (how do people get proper feedback? How do we maintain transparency to everyone, one of our core values? etc.). However, as I mentioned before Palantir encourages people to take ownership, so I feel I am empowered to fix things that I care more deeply about.",,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

From our Forward Deployed Engineers working directly with customers on their problems, to Software Developers focusing on how to get our infrastructure working faster, to our Events team planning opportunities to increase our health/wellness while making an impact on our local communities-- everyone is focused on trying to make the world better. Because the company was founded with an engineering mindset, most people (engineers and non-engineers) are imbued with a problem-solving mindset; while we may not be subject matter experts in the problems we face, I think that there's a general scrappiness/resourcefulness that is the company's culture.

There are going to be ups and downs in any job, but it's the people that you work with who are going to help you get through those down days. I've been working at Palantir for over 2 years now and I can honestly say some of my closest friends are my co-workers. Not only do I enjoy hanging out with these people outside of work, but I think they motivate me to be a better person and work harder. Sure people here can be a bit quirky sometimes, but I think I've always been impressed about the different things I can learn from people I work with.

In addition to the people who make my day more enjoyable there are the other things about Palantir that make it somewhere I plan on sticking around for the foreseeable future:
* Willingness to invest in me as an individual and provide opportunities for continued growth
* Giving me the freedom to not be micromanaged
* Making me feel that there is always an avenue for me to voice my concerns whether they're dealing with my individual work, other employees, or company direction
* Flexible work hours

* Lots of other random perks","Palantir isn't perfect, there are going to be times where you disagree with the direction of a project, a particular manager's style, another co-worker's performance, but I don't think any of these problems are unique to Palantir. I think what makes Palantir different is that when I feel that I have a problem there are ways for me to voice my concerns so they are at least heard and internalized.

I think the major problem many people at Palantir struggle with is what does career growth look like.

2015-08-27, Legal Ninja,"Palo Alto, CA",Current Employee ,Challenging and fulfilling,Challenging and fulfilling,0,"Palantir has been very rewarding professionally and personally – it’s meritocratic, the mission is hugely motivating, and everyone (after proving themselves) is expected and trusted to take on an inordinate amount of responsibility. For the legal team (ninjas) in particular, unlike at many other companies, we are deeply valued by the business instead of being viewed as a blocker. That’s enabled our team to work closely with the business and add value beyond just reviewing contracts or checking the box for legal compliance.

It’s not easy building the company and team that we want, but generally everyone, from leadership to people who just started yesterday, are motivated by the right things and want to improve things in the world and at Palantir. That starts with hiring people who are among the most capable people I’ve ever worked with but who aren’t arrogant or status-conscious. As a result, office politics generally aren’t played or rewarded, since everyone is focused on contributing value and actually getting things done. We work hard, but the work and people are inspiring and keep me motivated.","The problems we’re helping our customers solve are extremely varied, complex, and often time-sensitive. That makes for interesting and fulfilling work, but it also means it’s not a 9-5 job and can feel messy, as solutions are often only found by a continuous cycle of trial and improvement. That also means that succeeding at Palantir requires someone to be comfortable with failure and rapidly learn from mistakes, adapt to change, and be self-aware and honest about their strengths and weaknesses – not an easy thing to do.

* this is a great place to learn to be a better engineer - you are exposed to a huge variety of problems and the team around you is extremely supportive and helpful. You can walk up to anyone and ask for help and advice, and people genuinely try to help you rather than send you away.
* ownership of the work you are doing and the direction you are going -- and this is true for everyone, regardless if you have started 6 months or 6 years ago
* last but not least, the people are just amazing. Definitely smart, but what is even more important is that they are all very nice.","Some of the things that have often been challenging for me are:
* Palantir is a place when you learn everything very organically, rather than in a structured formal way.

The company remains mission-driven, with a sense of purpose and ethics that is, to my experience, unparalleled in the tech sector. You do feel like you're making a difference in the world when you work here.

Fellow employees are smart, interesting, and humorous. It combines the best of a non-profit (ethics, mission focus) with the best of Silicon Valley (talent, focus, drive, individuality as opposed to institutionality).","Work-life balance can be tough to maintain, as weekly hours can vary highly, especially among the client-associated work (Forward Deployed Engineer, Mission Specialist, Site Reliability, etc). Some weeks you work 50 hours, some weeks you work 70.

The company continues to suffer from growing pains--as we expand rapidly, we're forced to implement more leadership structure and compartmentalization than we've had in the past. While this is being recognized and handled as transparently as possible, there are nonetheless issues associated with it, and for people that have previously worked in small, laid-back startups it can feel a bit more structured/hierarchical than they'd like; I will say for me it still feels far less hierarchical than just about any other company I've worked for, especially outside Silicon Valley.

Given the company's dedication to change, things feel like they are constantly in flux, whether it's the location of your office desk or the direction of product development. Sometimes the logic behind decisions can remain opaque unless you go searching for the answer.

I've never been a fan of the way we handle employee departures--it's generally a quiet affair with little notification for those besides management and the employee--and despite continued complaints about it from employees, it's something that has failed to improve as much as I'd like.

Given the types of clients we work with, especially in the government, we can't always move as fast as we'd like, whether that means adopting ""cloud"" technology, completely changing the structure of our software, or something as simple as EOL'ing a software feature. This also means we often have dull/repetitive/less ""hot"" tech and tech debt tasks. As an engineer, you'll end up doing a mix of 'cool product development' and more mundane tasks like scripting and data integration/cleaning, something that's different about the stage of our company versus a startup or webapp-based company. It also means, as an engineer, you have to work harder to keep growing, especially outside the bounds of our software architecture.","Continue to focus on transparency and creating structures for decision-making that keep things as decentralized as possible.

I'm now in my sixth year at Palantir and I have to say that the transition was smooth. I continue to enjoy my work here every single day. Here are Pros I can think of

- Technical challenging projects that allow you to grow your technical skills. Plenty of help from experienced engineers in organization to ensure you don't feel lost
- Excellent leadership at Director level and first-line leads. Directors are open to any feedback, are very approachable and always trying to help out engineers
- Good work-life balance. I'm hearing some horror stories from my colleagues in tech industry, but I haven't had many problems here. I have been able to spend plenty of time with my family all these years
- Absolute meritocracy and very little bureaucracy. Very good resources available in terms of systems, facilities, etc.
- Very good perks","Like any other enterprise software company in this day and age, Palantir faces a stern test when it comes to figuring out what exactly their customers want and how can they deliver software for these needs.

This means that problems of all shapes and sizes are diagnosed and solved very quickly, and very few products, processes, and norms persist through time without good reason.
- Distributed responsibility: We bias toward giving people more responsibility than they can handle, rather than scaling responsibility according to what one ""deserves."" There are a few reasons for this, including necessity (we have more problems, both internal and customer-related, than we have manpower to solve) and philosophy (we'd rather learn to swim by jumping into the deep end).
- Disregard for convention: We pay very little attention to how other companies do things or how other people see us. We trust our own learnings over generally accepted norms. There are drawbacks to this (difficulty collaborating with other orgs that are not our customers, for example), but in general the benefits of this far outweigh the drawbacks.
- Outcome orientation: Palantir is singularly interested in outcomes. Process bows to impact, and not vice versa. It doesn't matter how many hours you work, when you come in. or how you got there (within reasonable constraints). What matters is whether the job got done exceptionally.
- Quality people: The people are great. Intelligent, mission-driven, highly-motivated, hard working.","- Internal communications: One of the drawbacks about having each team own their own processes, outcomes, etc is that teams become siloed and somewhat independent in a path-dependent kind of way. (One irony of this is that Palantir exists to break down siloes and barriers at many of our customer sites.) Compounding this issue is the fact that Palantir hasn't devoted many resources to developing strong internal communications to make sure that we are aligned in areas where alignment is important. This issue is recognized, though, so hopefully it can be fixed soon.
- Office locations/cost of living: Our US offices (Palo Alto, Santa Monica, Georgetown, NYC Meatpacking District, etc.) are located in areas that are extremely expensive, and not particularly family friendly.
- Work hours: It's true that it doesn't matter when you come in or what hours you work, but people at Palantir work really, really hard. We also rely on individuals to regulate their own work hours, which can lead to high-stress and, at worst, burnout.

* Smart and committed people willing to go the extra mile in business development - the sense of camaraderie and dedication is really something else
* Unstructured approach to people development and career growth - I've seen people join (with no meaningful prior experience) and grow into leaders of teams of the high double digits within a period of a year.
* Sense of opportunity - The above are probably in part due to the fact that the company is working on data problems at the dawn of what I believe to be a data revolution in industry (and hopefully government)
* Philosophy that the ""foot soldiers"" have a right and responsibility to move the company forward -
* Compensation philosophy is fair and perks are great - 'nuff said.

Structured mentorship and development fall into this trap IMO. People will genuinely help you grow, but the conventional means to facilitate it aren't super helpful to fostering it

I believe Palantir has gone through at least 2 major business transformations (in terms of how / what Palantir offers to our customers) since i've been here, which has allowed the company to grow substantially.

I think this is mostly caused by another set of issues which i think aren't great: the optics of only having people who have been at the company for a long time in executive positions (which is starting to be breached in a way that feels a bit sneaky to the rank-and-file).

2015-06-23, Business Development,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Inspiring place to work,Inspiring place to work,0,"Culture: My two favorite things about Palantir are its willingness to learn/change and the refreshing focus of my teammates on building something not extracting something.

On learning/change, the consistent metamorphosis Palantir undergoes is a fascinating thing to be a part of. This is primarily driven by the fact that the company dramatically values ability to learn/adapt over prior credentials/specific skillsets. Performance of individuals is largely judged by how fast they are learning and growing and this extends to teams/departments as well. When any part of the organization ceases to learn/adapt as fast as we would like, we don't hesitate to change things. This leads to an ever evolving organism that is willing to wrestle with hard truth when certain things aren’t working. This results in a refreshing environment that fosters intellectual honesty about the business and your own strengths and weaknesses. When you join Palantir you shouldn’t join for a specific role or function; you should join to hop on board the spaceship and recognize your job is to figure out how to build the most important data company in the world. What that looks like on a day to day basis is going to change dramatically over time.

On building versus extracting, my previous work experiences have always been about what I can get from the role. Next promotion, next bonus, setting up for exit opportunities, grad school entry etc…Nobody talks about that stuff at Palantir. They talk about figuring out how to make this thing work. The intellectual honesty about doing what is most important versus what is most interesting is amazing. I can’t communicate strongly enough how much impact this has on my happiness on a day to day basis; it is really inspiring to work in an environment like that.",This is not a 9-5 job. It is hard.

They are also very open about pushing you into new challenges and letting you rise to the occasion. I also really liked that failure is acceptable as long as you learn from it and apply those lessons moving forward. The investment they put into employees meant a lot to me.

- It's the sharpest group of people you'll ever get to work with...
- ...working on some of the most important problems society has regarding technology.

One of the cool features of Palantir that differentiates the company from the walled-garden (and useful, not knocking them) experiences one gets at Google, Dropbox, Facebook, etc is that Palantir deals with problems in the messy world, in a wide variety of industries - healthcare, law enforcement, disaster relief, energy, fraud, etc, and puts a lot of responsibility on individual employees to map new problems in the messy world to sets of existing or not existing (and needing to be built) pieces of software, to solve the problem. It's really empowering, and an exciting change of pace from what much of Silicon Valley considers important.","The downside of interacting with the messy world is that you can't easily construct a narrative about your business and expect it to remain unchanged (e.g. Dropbox being the place you store your files, or Google categorizing the world's information). As a rapidly growing company, Palantir has been forced to constantly refine its mission and why it operates the way it operates, and this can lead to a lot of ambiguity and anxiety, as the unknown always has a tendency to do.","Give ground grudgingly.

You will constantly be impressed by the caliber of your colleagues. They are proactive, insanely hard working, and driven to transform their domain of focus. Have never met a bad apple in my two years here.

Opportunity to learn/expand your skills. I came in as a non-technical person by and large. Slowly picking up lots of useful skills like SQL, light java-type programming, regex etc. Really enjoy getting to expand my technical skillset.

Healthy/open culture. High degree of trust and openness to feedback amongst colleagues. Overall positive personalities where the improv game mentality of ""yes and"" is the rule.

Opportunity to manifest personal vision. The business is still growing rapidly, with more to do than there are people to fill roles. This means that you wear many hats and are never bored ( I've done everything from technical development, data QA, product QA, demos, contract negotiation, customer success/user training, and intense analytical work). You constantly have opportunities to work with small teams and feel like a startup within a startup, particularly if you are working with a new industry vertical. If you have a crazy idea to transform an industry, your colleagues will listen to you and support you if you can convince them of the merit of your ideas.

Access to fascinating problems and customers. You will be exposed to C-Level executives at major institutions way before your peers. This creates amazing access and understanding to business challenges at a very high level.

Constantly challenged to grow as an individual and move into higher levels of responsibility in the organization, whether it's people management, product management, or developing/managing new customer relationships. Direct and timely feedback culture valued and you will receive a constant stream of information on how you can improve and be better.

Amazing food and amenities at the workplace!

Intense work schedule but there are release valves. There are many opportunities to flag if you feel overwhelmed and need to ramp up or down on activities. Definitely not as bad as consulting, particularly as Palantir wants to cultivate employees over the long term and avoid employee burnout.","If you are not comfortable with rapidly evolving business vision and loose direction on your job, this will be a challenging place.

I had a fear that any move to an established company (even in Silicon Valley) would be a soul-sucking experience. Fortunately, that isn't the case at Palantir at all. The mission and work are very much impactful, and the company empowers employees to be able to contribute in a measurable way.

As an entrepreneur, that support to take on new things and work on multiple projects at once is a huge part of why I'm interested in staying at the company long-term. The fact that there's so much work, plus low barriers internally allowed me to move through a few different roles, before settling on one for a longer period of time (and most likely changing again in the future). I can't imagine the feeling of stagnation that must come in other workplaces, where people protect their turf rather than openly welcome participation on things that others can contribute.

The company culture itself is also a huge positive part of working at Palantir.

• Palantir has assembled the strongest group of people that I’ve ever had the privilege of working with, including a brilliant engineering team.
• It’s extremely comforting to know that when someone says that they’ll do something, you don’t really have to think about it anymore.

Ownership of Problems

• I joined Palantir because I didn’t have an opportunity to own the outcome of any of the work I did at a large consulting firm.
• Since my first month on the job I’ve been personally responsible for the outcome of the project that I’m working on. This can be stressful at times, but knowing that you’re empowered to control/drive the direction of a project is much better than the helpless feeling associated with a lack of ownership.
• The company is very “flat” in the sense that decision-making authority is distributed down to the lowest level possible. There are support mechanisms in place to ensure that people have all of the resources that they need to make informed decisions.

High Impact Work

• Over the course of the last ~4 years since I’ve been at Palantir, we’ve continued to get access to larger and more impactful problems in the government space.
• It’s always rewarding to see the output of a case/investigation/engagement that you worked on in the news a few days later.","Growth

• The company has grown over 4x since I started a little less than four years ago, and that hasn’t always been the smoothest process.
• In some cases direction from management can be a bit unclear, and we’ve also had some issues with internal processes breaking down at scale. However, in each of these cases I’ve always felt that I could get what I needed by reaching out directly to the individual(s) in question and simply asking.
• As long as you’re comfortable taking the initiative and reaching out to folks to get what you need, I can’t imagine someone having any issues.","Keep it up!

Understanding the impact of my work is something that motivates me and that I really enjoy.

Palantir's people and culture are also significant pros. I have the privilege of working with people who are incredibly smart, dedicated to accomplishing a mission, and most importantly, genuine.

This is great for driving individual growth, and also allows Palantir to have an impact beyond our immediate footprint.","Working with broken enterprise clients is a grind - you can spend weeks onsite without seeing the inside of a Palantir office, and all of this chafing against process and bureaucracy can eventually take its toll.",Invest in people - allow them to take time off of the implementation grind and further their skills or just take a break.,4.0,,,,,

The work is demanding and impactful, the organization is empowering, the people are impressive and great to work with, and up and down the company is always seeking ways to improve. I always did interesting work prior to joining Palantir, but I was also always looking for side projects, new opportunities, the next thing. Since joining Palantir I have done more than just interesting work, I've become part of an organization that I believe in. I've not just been given countless opportunities to own things at company, it has been demanded that I own things. Whereas previous jobs I might have been told, ""that's not your concern"" at Palantir I am told, ""If it seems broken, help fix it. Make it better."" and have then been given the support to make that happen.

In addition to the work itself, the company culture is fantastic. I enjoy the company of just about everyone I work with and have had the opportunity to turn a fair share of my colleagues into great friends. And while the growth of the company can make it feel a bit less 'homey', I continue to meet great people constantly. Other than the people, the offices are awesome. The support from our operations people is amazing, from the quality of food I get to eat to the events that are planned on my behalf. It is easy to take those things for granted but they are pretty great.","Since Palantir is based out of Palo Alto, a lot of internal meetings tend to later in the day East Coast time. This can complicate things for those of us with families to go home to. That said, I usually just take these meetings from home.

We are much better at learning by doing than by formalized (classroom style) education, which can sometimes mean that it is hard to learn something completely new if it is unrelated to the specific work you are doing. The company is working to expand other types of learning, and I've found that I've learned so much by doing that I hardly have time to think about additional educational opportunities, but there is room for improvement here.","Just look at the title of this section: ""Advice to Management"". It is almost implied that I can't engage management directly with my advice.

My coworkers and I counted our vacation hours, worked from home, and took long lunches. Palantir is completely, utterly, totally different. I love my work here, and I'm inspired to do phenomenal work not just for some promotion or title but for a greater good in the world. A lot of the reviews I've read about Palantir talk about working hard, and that's definitely true, but I'd rather spend 50 hours a week doing something I believe in than 5 hours a week doing something I don't.

Autonomy - I don't have a boss - none of us do. How cool is that? I get to decide what I need to do to do a great job. Nobody's making sure I'm at my desk by 9 or assigning me Powerpoints at 5pm. Since I have the most context on my deployment, I'm empowered to do what I think is right. If I see something wrong, the onus is on me to fix it. Not once have I ever felt I was doing something just because someone else told me to.

People - Before Palantir, I had never worked somewhere where everyone was smart and dedicated. I'll probably never have this experience after Palantir either. From the CEO (on the road like 300 days a year) to the guys serving breakfast in the morning, everyone is here to crush their job. It's incredibly inspiring.

It's actually fun to be here - Nerf fights, puppies running around, colleagues riding around on Razor scooters and playing FIFA... I actually LIKE being at work. So few people get to say that, and I feel really lucky.","Comp - The salary cap is obviously inconvenient, but I still ended up with a raise to come here, and I probably would have taken a pay cut to do this work anyway. Nobody here is going hungry, and we've got upside in our equity.

Location - Tyson's Corner (where the DC office is located) is really inconvenient. Palantir is moving the office to Georgetown, which should be a huge improvement.","Haha, this is kind of a silly question. We're all empowered to fix things that are broken and take the lead on things we find important or that we'd be good at, so it's weird to me to think of Palantir as having ""management"" without thinking of all of us.

If this means the CEO and the handful of Directors, then I'd tell them to send more frequent updates on big developments in the business (not just limit news to Beer Syncs). We do get a ton of e-mail, but a bi-weekly or monthly update would help a lot with SA.

2013-03-29, Forward Deployed Engineer,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,Palantir is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,Palantir is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,0,"I can't think of a better place to work than Palantir. I've worked at several tech companies during my time including several big names you have all heard of, and I could never imagine going back to those places after having worked at Palantir.

I'd like to mention early on that Palantir is a VERY intense place to work. You're surrounded by super smart people who are incredibly passionate about our mission, and those of us in the field are working directly with customers whose job responsibilities include keeping citizens safe. I've noticed a few very negative reviews of Palantir but I suspect most of those come from people who arrive at Palantir thinking it was a 9-5 job. It's not -- everyone is expected to execute as strongly as the person next to them, and those who don't contribute are obvious to the rest of the team. Some folks may be surprised that they didn't realize what it was that they signed up for, but I assure you everyone is given notice and a fair warning if they are underperforming.

Working at Palantir is different from anything else out there. How many computer science students can say they've worked in war zones as rockets exploded 100 ft away? How many Silicon Valley startups have offices around the world and encourage you to explore international opportunities? How many of us can look back and say we honestly worked on projects that saved countless lives or made the world a better place? In the Valley most people are either working on advertising systems (Google) or tweaking social networking platforms (Facebook, Twitter). The only other companies I can think of with such world-changing ambitions are Tesla and SpaceX.

Beyond the mission itself, the people at Palantir are top tier. When you sign on as a member of the business team, the Forward Deployed Engineers, you're joining a regiment of the best of the best. I've never seen any environment where so many super smart people are so passionate about their work, and it certainly shows. You also get a chance to experience first-hand what a profound impact we're having in so many areas. It's not something we can typically talk about publicly, but it's more rewarding than anything I've ever done before.

The company also treats its employees really well. There are the usual perks on the level of Facebook and Google, including the best corporate food I've ever experienced (the HQ office has a full cooking staff with locally sourced organic/grass-fed/free-range/etc food). We also have a world class ops team that takes care of us so we can focus on our work.

When you join Palantir, know that you're immersing yourself into a different experience than anything else you have seen before, but even though people joke about us working too hard and getting too involved, I wouldn't trade it for anything else.","If you're looking for a 9-5 job, you're looking in the wrong place. Try Google or Facebook if you want a cozy California life.

The company has done a great job at adapting to its growing pains as they come up. I think the only real con I can think of is the salary cap -- people have been with the company for many years and raises are rare, even with top performance. Yes, we get equity bonuses and our cash bonuses can convert into more equity, but the once-youthful staff is aging and real life catches up eventually with marriages and mortgage payments. I'm not suggesting we need anything like 15% raises per year or something structured like you see in the big firms, but even keeping up with inflation would be a good start.","Keep adapting to our growing pains.

I liked my old job, but I love Palantir! I do work long hours, but when you really enjoy your work the time flies by.

Having worked at Palantir for a while now I can tell you that a lot of the people that are griping about not being integrated quickly are because it's a high speed and challenging work environment. Most people coming into the DC office are not familiar with the flexible work environment that Palantir provides. Nor are they familiar with how things work at a fast moving company with streamlined oversight.

At Palantir the only barrier to success is you. Sure you are given left and right limits, but really you control your own destiny at Palantir. I love this and try to seize every opportunity I can, however it is not necessarily easy to adjust to this type of environment. I think this is where some of the frustration from other reviews comes from. In my experience I did not truly ""get it"" until after 6 months of hard work.

The personal growth I have gained at Palantir has been invaluable as well; in three years I have noticed so much personal growth in my professional skills. This is because I feel like I have been given the opportunity to do a lot of things that I would have never had the chance to do anywhere else.

Even with all of the awesomeness of personal growth, career development, and working with awesome people, you also get some fantastic perks which you can read about on the website.",Palantir is so different from a lot of companies that it is often hard for people to adjust. This in turn can cause friction with people that don't adjust well to change.,Keep doing what your doing!,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2012-12-04, Software Engineer,"Palo Alto, CA",Current Employee ,"Challenging, purposeful work in a great environment","Challenging, purposeful work in a great environment",0,"1. First and foremost, Palantir is working on some of the hardest and most important problems in the world. Working on these is both intellectually stimulating and extremely rewarding.

2. What initially drew me to the company, and what keeps me here today (in addition to 1 above), are the amazing people who work here. They're some of the smartest people I know and also some of my best friends. It's a great environment to work in, learn in, and enjoy life in. Also, there's a no a-hole policy, meaning we don't hire people we wouldn't want to work with on a daily basis, so everyone is someone you can easily enjoy working with and being friends with.

3. Meritocracy: the best idea wins, even if it's proposed by an intern. Seniority and experience will likely give you the ability to have better ideas, but it doesn't mean you're always right.

4. Lack of politics: similar to 3, you don't have to ""know someone"" or be a ""senior engineer"" or whatever to move up in the company or get your ideas heard.

5. Transparency: I ask a question, I get an answer. It may not be what I wanted or expected to hear, but will be the truth.

6. At Palantir, I have a chance to grow as an individual and take on leadership roles in a variety of ways. My primary responsibility is writing code to solve hard problems, but this past summer I mentored several newcomers and have been heavily involved in our recruiting efforts for quite a while. It's like a choose your own adventure where the transitions are based on your career goals and how you want to grow.

7. Decentralized decision-making and individual ownership: everyone owns pretty large portions of the codebase, and decisions are made at the level of project teams, not by ""senior management"" (which is hardly even a thing at Palantir). Sure, we have people who help drive the vision of the company and products as a whole, but like all of the people in leadership positions here, they're less controllers and decision-makers and more resources to help you make the biggest impact you can and solve the most important problems as effectively as possible.

8. Experimentation, agility, and investment in the future: Nothing is sacred here. Deleting code can be just as important (or more) than writing code. We're not afraid to try things out and discard them if they don't work. Process is a tool you refine and hone to serve you, not something you're a slave to. We're willing to be wrong and learn from it. Which may cause some short-term pain, but in the long-term it's well worth it.","1. Growing pains: Palantir is growing very, very fast, which is both good and bad. It's hard to keep up with all the new things that are happening constantly, and it's hard to get to know all the new people starting continuously. And a lot of people are really tired of all the recruiting we have to do. I happen to like it, but that's just me. We're also running low on people who are interested in taking on leadership positions, which means our current leads get overworked and we have to look externally to hire new leads. Still don't know how that's going to turn out.

2. Working in challenging environments: This is really less of a con and more of a reality of working on the most important problems we can find in the most important places. When your deployment lives on a classified network or even just contains sensitive data, it can be a PITA to diagnose and fix problems.

3. No consumer product: It's really hard to explain what we do to people. Especially non-technical people. Work at Facebook or Amazon? Show mom the website. Palantir? Not so much. Most people here aren't much bothered by this, but it is kind of lame.

4. Occasional lack of direction for projects: Sometimes when you're working on something completely new, there will be times when you just...aren't really sure what to do next. We have great ways to get feedback from customers and our Forward Deployed Engineers, but that can take time during which projects can stall, which can be frustrating.

And now for some things that others might see as cons, but I don't

1. Work-life balance: people work really hard here. Really, really hard. I'm here 60+ hours a week usually (though not all of that is time spent working). However, I don't have any set hours. I can come in whenever I want as long as I'm getting things done. And I really like the work, so it's not really an issue for me. Plenty of people have families and work more ""standard"" hours while the younger crowd tends to come in later and stay later. And there's no vacation policy, so if I need a break, I can just take it, again provided I'm getting done what needs to get done.

2. Compensation: Salaries here are pretty low by Valley standards, but the equity more than makes up for it. Of course, this becomes less true over time, but as of now, it's still very true. Also, the other benefits are great, including 3 meals a day, 5 days a week (plus lunch Saturdays!). Though honestly, people who are primarily financially motivated would probably be less likely to find Palantir a satisfying environment than someone like me who is more motivated by purposeful work and learning from other awesome engineers.","Of course, I've already talked with ""senior management"" about this, but there is such a thing as growing too fast, and we have to be careful not to do so. When I was an intern 3.5 years ago, the whole team was my ""mentor"". Nowadays, new people have to share their one mentor with 1-2 other new people. It's necessary, but it makes it harder for new people to meet and learn from those who have been around for a while and really feel welcome and important in the company.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2012-12-16, Forward Deployed Engineer,"McLean, VA",Current Employee ,"Palantir is the absolute hardest, and most rewarding job I've ever had","Palantir is the absolute hardest, and most rewarding job I've ever had",0,"In my nearly two years with Palantir, I'm certain that I've had a much bigger outcome on the impact I worked in government for seven years to affect: A government making better decisions driven by better information. It sounds cheesy, it's at times a slow and hard fought battle but we're actually winning it. If you've ever worked with the government you know what a huge accomplishment that is.

I am also extraordinarily lucky to work with the highest integrity, smartest people I've ever known. Working a campaign in 2006 I thought I had worked with the most capable, tight knit, well motivated team I would have the fortune to work with. Only Palantir has topped that experience.

Even if you forget both of the above reasons to work for the company - which are by far the best reasons to work here - they treat us extremely well. It's not just the big decisions like compensation and benefits, but also hundreds of small decisions where an ordinary company would optimize on keeping things simpler or spending less money, and it's clear that Palantir as a company prefers in each case to actually make my life easier and more productive, even if it means spending more money.","The work - both in volume and in degree of difficulty - is intense. Not only are we always trying to make something improbable happen with government customers in Silicon Valley timelines, but we're on the hook for the quality of that work in a big way.

At Palantir, I can honestly say that I have never been ""managed."" Leadership is there to guide you and help you when you need it, but not manage you. This helps you gain a huge amount of personal ownership over your projects which is encouraged. Employees are encouraged to make critical decisions in the field and supported by leadership.

-Meritocracy. You are only as successful as you make yourself. You are judged on your outputs and not your inputs. While this is a norm and maybe an expectation in Silicon Valley, its nearly unheard of on the East Coast.

-No BS. BS in any form is discouraged. From our no politics philosophy to the idea of only having meetings when absolutely necessary, we live and breath a minimal BS culture.

-Transparency. Leadership will answer ANY question you have and not only that but they will do it in front of the entire company.

-Make my own schedule. This is important to me as I have a family to worry about and a personal life to manage. As long as I excel and keep performing, no one seems to mind how I manage my time.

-The People. This is the biggest differentiator about Palantir. Everyone at Palantir is smart, friendly, unique and generally awesome. I know that I could ask anyone to help me with my work and not only would they step up they'd do just a good a job as I could. This is super rare in a company.

-Solving real problems. Being able to quantify the real world results of our work is amazing and it happens daily at Palantir.

-Fantastic benefits. If you are from the east coast, no one can beat the benefits.","-Massive Growth. This is awesome and also the source of most of our problems at the same time. We often don't scale our processes until we realize they are broken. This includes managing people, structuring teams, trying to communicate across teams, etc. The transfer of organizational knowledge has been the toughest problem to hack IMO.

-Recruiting. Its none stop and a huge time sink. I know its worth it and we need it to not only survive, but to maintain the pros listed above, but it can be draining at times.

-Salary. If you are east coast, this will probably be less than you make now. Regardless, the intangible benefits, unlimited leave policy and stock options more than make up for this. The other job offer I was considering before coming to Palantir was $55k more than what I make at Palantir.

2012-12-04, Engineer,"Palo Alto, CA",Current Employee ,Rock solid team doing great work,Rock solid team doing great work,0,"- Almost all employees are extremely competent, friendly, and have a great attitude. The ""No A-hole"" policy works.
- The software and the team are actually making a difference in the world. The missions in antifraud, law enforcement, national security, and others are really inspirational.
- A real commitment to protecting privacy and civil liberties. I, personally, feel much better about the government agencies that have my personal info using Palantir, than any other software that does similar things (and probably hasn't built protections in from the ground-up.)
- The technical bar is high, and there's lots of opportunity to learn from others who are better than you (and not stuck up about it... see the first point.)
- Lots of individual autonomy. Employees are treated as adults in regards to time management, resource usage, technology choices, etc.
- Company leadership has a commitment to transparency, which is especially important in the face of some of the tricky moral dilemmas that come with access to lots of data. When there are issues, they're brought out in the open and discussed.
- Lots of perks (meals, snacks, swag, laundry, massage, chiro, physician, events). Other reviews have mentioned meals as a way of chaining you to your desk, but that hasn't been my experience. Nobody cares if I fill up to-go containers and bring dinner home to the family, or invite outside friends to eat a nice leisurely lunch (see point about being treated like an adult).
- Equity that will actually be worth something.","- There have been some growing pains as the company expands rapidly. It's starting to feel less like one big happy family and more fragmented.
- There is always so much to do, and always too few hands to do it. Since we have a lot of autonomy to dictate our own load/pace, we can often self-impose too much, and/or try to keep up with the next guy who is inevitably whip-smart and hard working. I almost always feel like I'm behind (which, admittedly, may be my own anxiety - nobody is harping on me to catch up.)
- All leads are promoted from within, which means that while they will definitely understand your engineering challenges, they may still be honing their management and people skills.
- The recruiting/interviewing load can eat up a lot of time during the heavy seasons, killing whole weeks of independent productivity. It's important work, but can be draining.
- People outside the company call us ""secretive"" and ""shadowy"" and accuse us of doing nefarious things that we don't do. Inevitably, arguing and feeding the trolls just makes you sound worse.
- Salaries are lower than other silicon valley companies. It's enough to live comfortably, and all those pros definitely soften the blow.","Keep up the trend of reaching out to employees to hear their concerns, and don't be afraid to take bold moves to keep the company as great a place to work as it grows.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

The value of this can't be overstated. Every corner of Palantir is full of incredibly talented people (from our Directors to the legal team to the guys who stock the shelves in the kitchen... highly talented and hard-working people).
- The work seriously, actually matters. When you build the product and train the users who are finding bad guys, solving crimes, preventing money from disappearing to fraud, etc. It's great to point at a headline and say ""my work enabled that.""
- Low levels are empowered to own their work. This is super important. By and large, most employees have clear expectations of their work output and are trusted to own it. I've seen some complaints about meddling managers, but I don't see it at all. It's standard to have a ~30 minute 1:1 with your lead, which I really like. My 1:1's are essentially my lead asking ""How are things going? Anything blocking you? What can I do to help you out?"" Super low overhead (and very healthy).
- And I have to highlight the equity upside... Palantir has the potential to be hugely valuable, which, in turn, has the potential to be very good for employees.","Reading some of the other reviews, it's like we're not working at the same company... it's honestly mind boggling. Yes, we are growing quickly and that induces lots of struggles (any company that's roughly doubling each year has these issues), but it's still a great place to work.

I also second the other review about ""work-life balance"" being perceived as a con, but it's not to me. Yes, I work a lot a lot... but I work on my own schedule, have unlimited vacation time, and the company treats us exceptionally well (comfortable offices, very accommodating IT teams, food/drink, etc). I'm genuinely happy at work (and I wake up every day excited to go to work)... so yeah, the hours are long, but for me, I like that. If you are expecting a 9 to 5, clock-in/clock-out type of job, you're not going to like Palantir. For me? It's great.",Keep doing what you're doing!

It is remarkably easy to use, learn from, and totally worth a trial, just to see how it works.

Personnel wise, their hiring process is rather strict, but fair. They have a heavy engineering culture, and encourage personal projects to be done to forward the company. The office I was employed in (Mclean, VA) has an interesting set up, and it is growing quickly. Little scooters are given to move from office to office, and you can get nearly anything to make your office your own sort of work space.

Food wise, they have a caterer or cook set up, and there are free beverages, all of it available at all hours (Keep this in mind).

The pay is above average, with a cool way of setting your own payscale. When an offer is made, they give three different offers, with three different stock options (5 year vesting schedule). I would guess they pay above about 25-50% of the average amount.","With all these benefits come a drawback. I estimated a average work day of around 10 hours. I would start at 8 AM, and leave at around 7 PM or so, an only in the first week. I expected these hours to go up as time went on. The food and pay are high to encourage you to remain in the office, and the standard work week is discouraged.

Although they like to say they observe a Work Life balance, I generally could not see it happening, especially with such hours.

Travel, you can expect to fly out to another location fairly regularly on short notice. Don't expect to make any real long term plans, and prepare to live out of a suitcase for more than a few weeks out of the year.

Finally, the management wants you to ""Drink the Kool Aid"" rather deep. They try to indoctrinate you into their methods of thinking and working before you even start working there. It seems to be based on T-shirts and clothing, more than anything else. If you are not a estimated ""fit"" within their box of thinking, expect to not get an offer, or even be let go.

I would be extremely wary of any ""Openings"" found within the Department of Defense section of this company. It is large and growing, but the leader of this section has been described over and over as ""Intense"". Be very careful of what you say and who you speak to in this company, or you may find yourself without a job with no real warning.","Be more careful with your hiring and firing practices in the future. Even though you are a growing company, understand that the hours that were put in before will eventually have to change. The ""small company"" time frame is coming to a close for you, and you may have to move closer to the standard work week (horrifying, I know).

Your employees are going to want to enjoy time with their families, and in the future, you will have to adapt your travel times to cope with this. Some people may want to have other activities and even other jobs on the side, and you will have to clearly define what you expect from your employees in the future.

2016-09-10, Forward Deployed Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Hard but both deeply rewarding and highly formative,Hard but both deeply rewarding and highly formative,0,"1. After some time working at Palantir you realize that actually almost everything important in the world (I am not just talking about terrorism or the various philanthropy projects here, but also the banking system, how we obtain and use energy, and even things like the media) are operating in grossly deficient ways, essentially because of the diversity of their data, and how hard it is to combine and manipulate in sane ways. Nowhere else gives you access to all of these things at once, and this means that you are in a unique position: able to both work on these problems in the specific cases (which is very rewarding, at least to me), and also able to go further and contribute to what general solutions look might look like in the future. We make mistakes in all areas of this all the time (from customer engagements that don't work out, to product mistakes, and everything in between) but this is the challenge that you get to work on here. For me, when I see these organizations forced to do their work based on guesses and stale information, considering their importance to society (both in terms of downside risk but also upside potential) I feel a high sense of urgency to help, and Palantir gives me agency to do that.

2. Related to (1), because we are all contributing to an emerging product story for solving real data integration problems, it is actually possible for a team of five people to land at a Fortune 50 company or a government department and realistically create a significant, lasting improvement to the way they operate by building on what we have already created. I don't think I could have done the things I have done without this. It would be too technically challenging in the timeline (for the number of people) and frankly also too hard to figure out what to do without the lessons learned elsewhere.

3. Despite (2), the small teams we operate in mean that you are regularly facing challenges that are both almost too hard for you, and in which success is critical. This creates an environment where real, unexpected, drastic personal growth can happen. We don't have promotions or set growth paths or anything like that, and this can be a challenge (which I will discuss further below) but on the other hand, if you know what your growth path is going to be in advance, you are by definition not doing something novel. I would rather achieve faster growth by making sure the fundamentals are there (very hard things to do, and a real need to succeed at them) than by following the well-trodden path. I think that in following defined growth paths I would be trading off the speed of the growth for the comfort of knowing what is coming up. If you want to do this then fine, but I don't.

4. Because to work here and be happy here you need to be hungry for the above (if you are not then your life will be miserable), the people that do exist at Palantir are generally excellent to be around, in ways that are hard to exhaustively cover. I will say that I have met some of the most inspiring people, the people that challenged me the most, and the people that I trust most in execution at Palantir. Beyond this I have honestly made some of the best friends of my life here too, because our hiring is a strong filter and then our lives consist of a shared struggle against adversity. This often forges deep bonds.","I love being a part of Palantir... nevertheless here's an honest attempt at outlining some cons:

1. Working here is also a constant struggle. Everything is broken all the time because (as I mentioned above talking about growth) we are constantly doing things that are almost too hard for us (for now). This manifests at many levels. We are trying to overcome significant engineering challenges where it is not clear up front the best way to do something, and a lot of what we build is wrong the first time (and probably the second time too) while we're working out what works. This is a symptom of the severity of the challenge, but it can also be demoralizing. This is also the first time we have operated as a 2000 person company (and when we were a 1900 person company we were operating as that for the first time too). We are constantly learning the hard way how to do things in a way that works at new sizes of organization and with new sizes of problems. Working here requires a willingness to fail and a willingness to tolerate the failure of others (and to be constructive with both yourself and others around failure).

2. Growth at Palantir happens (as above) through experiences of attempting unbelievably difficult things with support that, while large, is still lacking in the face of the new challenge. These experiences happen somewhat frequently, but between them there isn't a set course for incremental improvement. This can mean that there is a sensation of not knowing how to grow at Palantir. In fact, not just a sensation -- we often do not actually know specifically how to grow at a given time. Doing hard things that multiplicatively grow you in short bursts is the only real way to grow at Palantir. But this requires a certain level of faith that you will succeed in seeking the next one of these moments, and the ability to hold that wider perspective in the face of what might seem right now like limited-to-no growth.

3. Day-to-day life is full of pain. Jetlag, customer IT departments that don't operate how we would like, a volume and urgency of work that often goes way beyond what a typical software engineer is facing. Failing again at the thing you are attempting. Stress, tiredness, frustration, and standing in an immigration line at the border of a country you were last in the previous week. One time I had to get my coworker on the same flight to AirDrop me a jar file I didn't have so I could compile this thing when the plane didn't have internet. If you come here I think you must come here for the thing we are working toward, not the sensation of doing it. Having said this, the people, the sensation of success when you achieve it, and the growth you can see in yourself when you look back over a year or more are all wonderful... just be prepared for the pain in between these things.",,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Every day is new and challenging. The challenges vary, sometimes they're in the form of frustrating customers or poorly designed software or urgent deadlines, but boring days are few and far between.

An attitude of always striving to be better, as a company, as a team, as a world, and as an individual. There will always be imperfections in everything, tradeoffs to be made, but so long as we're owning our failures, learning from them, and ultimately moving forward in the name of outcomes, we're doing alright.

If you're looking for a place like Google, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, etc., look somewhere else. Being driven by a mission means pushing hard towards the goals you're trying to get to - yes, this results in long work-hours, yes, this results in people who are ""cult-like"" in that they deeply care about the success of Palantir. If you're looking for a place where you can unplug and stop caring at 5pm every day, Palantir is unlikely to be the place for you.

If you're looking to be a software engineer who only works on the fanciest, shiniest problems, look somewhere else. The real world is a messy place

Highly chaotic environment. This can lead to the feeling of ""do we even know what we're doing"", but in my opinion it's more like . Palantir is always changing, in terms of business strategy, in terms of internal prioritization, in terms of job titles / work that needs to be done. If you thrive in dynamism, this is awesome, but if you believe in long-term roadmaps, immovable product vision, and highly structured environments, this also isn't the place for you.

If you're looking for a structured growth path with titles and official promotions, then this also probably isn't the right place for you. Growth is self-driven, and can come in a lot of different shades and flavors. You won't get as much explicit back-patting as you might at a larger company, so it takes more out of you to understand the value you're providing and how good / useful it is.","Your opinions are good ones and your strategies are reasonable!

Opportunity to interact with clients

Standard Silicon Valley perks, even outside of Silicon Valley

Everyone here is hard-working (but read below!)

Extremely good marketing","Internal politics is difficult to maneuver across the commercial umbrella. Teams have complex, implicit structures while leadership claims that teams are flat.

Emphasis is put on aesthetics and impressiveness over utility in certain teams, and especially in early teams (""pilots"").

Little opportunity for software development. This is not usually a software development role.

Little opportunity for analytics. This is not usually a data science role.

In many teams 60 hours is the norm, not the exception. Quality and morale suffer. Palantir is not a startup -- there is no ""lottery ticket"", so 60 hours should not be the norm.

Work is client-specific, and is not usually challenging, innovating, or exciting. There is little room for learning/growth.

Certain teams could be more collaborative and open. I had to go out of my way to get constructive feedback here than at other similar companies.

Many of these same teams do not have knowledge of the areas they work in, and are proud of their ignorance.

Palantir insists it has a flat corporate structure. It exists, it's just implicit.

3. Extremely high standard of offices, nice perks, very relaxed expense policy.
4. Offices around the world, and the company is very open to moving people around, if you want to.","A few basic elements of Palantir : smart, young, inexperienced pool of employees and managers, together with aspiration to have a flat hierarchical structure. This means:

1. Very limited leadership across of levels of the company.
Most people-leads and project-leads are inexperienced when it comes to leading people. Your lead is likely to be very lacking in managerial skills and emotional intelligence required to be a good lead. The company does not acknowledge that, and does not provide any guidance or assistance to improve the quality of leadership. Department leads are often so busy and travel so often that they have no presence and display no leadership at all, other than sending extra-long emails every few months explaining how hard it is to work for Palantir.
2. Complete disregard to people’s personal life and to work-life balance.
People are moved across projects and offices constantly. You might be expected move to another office on the other side of the world in the blink of an eye, and turning down such a transfer is perceived as lack of cooperation and willingness to help the company. In addition, most projects are understaffed and have unrealistic deadlines, which requires work none-stop.
3. Very limited career path.
Flat structure and the fact that most directors and leads in the company are friends of the CEO/directors mean that career development is limited. In some roles, the only option is to move between projects.
4. Disregard to experience
The company fosters an atmosphere of disrespect for experiencing and maturity, believing that all that’s needed is intelligence. This is great if you are a fresh collage graduate, not so great if you are in your 30s with some work and life experience.
5. Kool-aid
The company believes in it’s own stories of greatness and talks about ""the mission"", when in fact most people work for big banks and big industries, helping them to make more money.
6. Low salaries
Salaries are lower than average, and while the company tries to lure people with stock options, they are not as liquid as the company would like employees to believe.
7. Lack of leadership means that company is very disorganised and chaotic. Immaturity of leadership means they are in love with this situation, and believe this is a proof of the greatness and uniqueness of the company.
8. Complete lack of communication
Endless emails, but on a very basic level, there is almost no communication. This means a lot of work is left undone, or alternatively, duplicated.

2015-08-30, Forward Deployed Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Mostly hypocrisy,Mostly hypocrisy,0,"Whilst most of the time you will be lied to, in absolute terms, a lot of what you will be doing or suffering from, will probably be better than you will experience else where. For example, large banks are obviously going to be more hierarchical as an absolute, but they also (largely) don't pretend not to be. I would large suggest reading the below for a more honest view of the company, and if it sounds like a suitable environment for you, go for it, the main issue is its not what you will be told in interviews or recruiting.","Mostly hypocrisy - below are several examples outlined against Palantir's supposed core values.
Flat / No hierarchy: Whilst Palantir will pretend to have a flat structure where merit wins out alone, we also happen to have a concept of ""trust circles"". Here, people are granted a rating (usually ""inner trust circle"" or ""outer trust circle"") which indicates that their concerns are more directly considered by management and directors. In and of itself, I see no issues with this, however, its introduction was never publicly announced, and thus its existence is not widely known, along with how one would ever become part of a ""trusted circle"".
Saving the shire: Most of what you will work on is helping financial and consumer industries secure additional footprint (i.e. expand in new areas or secure additional market growth in new areas). Palantir philanthropic team is one of the only teams to have SHRUNK in the last 2 years (given the company has experience an average of ~90% growth in this time that is even more shocking) with most of the focus being on both insurance, and the oil and gas industry. Additionally focuses on world and environmental health have been actively stopped by leadership, so ""saving the shire"" is unlikely to be something you do. (Interestingly in the last two year's the company line has also changed from ""solving the world's hardest problems"" to ""solving the world's hardest problems, for the world's most important organisations"").
Transparency: It's hard to provide real examples here without breaking confidentiality, but I have received multiple emails titled as being strictly ORCON (originator controlled) to even within the organization because someone needs to ""ensure there is a correct framing"" (framing is code for white lies; in case that was non-obvious), as well as a lot of active push-back against independent sharing of compensation for ""the employees own benefit"".
Interesting problems: If you are a forward deployed engineer you will mostly be working on data integration and analysis. For reference to those that don't know, mostly this will involved trying to figure out the schema to 1000+ xml files containing ""important information"" (no schema will be provided by the customer) or correctly joining multiple SQL tables. Whilst there is definitely some joy to be had in writing a nifty tool that figures out likely schema's or predicts row types, after writing the 100th json schema for a particular dataset you realise that the problem is fundamentally uninteresting in and of itself. Once this grunt work has been completed, some are lucky enough to work directly with analysts, however most (because of the vast number of Proof Of Concepts) will be working on creating demoware that appeals to middle-managers that know little about analytics, merely appreciating something with animations and good design.","The move away / corruption of our core values should be obvious from the fact that despite the growth of public awareness we now require ""sales interviews"" to convince applicants they should work here as well as actively asking employees to write positive Glassdoor reviews because reality has become too scathing for us to handle.",2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0
2015-09-02, Deployment Strategist,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Review from Current Employee,Review from Current Employee,0,"I clearly drank the kool-aid but will try to keep this review balanced:

- The obvious one you always hear about - lots of office perks: masseuses, fitness stipend, housing stipend, delicious and organically sourced meals and snacks, scooter tracks, ping pong tables, bars on every floor, gorgeous views of London
- Perfect environment for self-motivated people who don't want to be defined by their job titles. Whatever you want to take on, you can. There are no limits. So despite the fact that we don't reward value contributed by formal promotions or titles, there is ample opportunity for career and personal growth (I would say more so than in a traditional, structured environment) - and lots of recognition of/appreciation for people who are doing awesome things.
- We work long hours but respect each other's extracurricular commitments and need for balance. We all have different preferences for when we work (early mornings v late nights v weekends v no weekends) and no one is keeping tabs on how and when you do your work.
-The most thoughtfully smart group of people I have worked with. Everyone is generative and reflective and deriving the most value out of every conversation, action and decision is at the root of all quests.
-Egoless environment where everyone appreciates getting and giving critique in the spirit that we all deserve to be here but we can always grow/improve . Egoless environment also means no one speaks just to hear their own voice - every offered contribution is thoughtful.
- Opportunities to be exposed to a number of different problems across a number of different industries and to embed deeply with them.
- Young, dynamic environment of people who are driven by challenge and excited to be at Palantir. We regroup for happy hour every Friday (at least, and these often turn into all night affairs) and enjoy catching up and being around each other. Partners/families are always welcome as well.
- Additional pros (to me) have been noted below in the Cons...","- Can be harder to ramp up/find your place quickly if you are not a technical person but this should be expected for those moving to a new industry and the resources (human, legible and otherwise) are unlimited to help one in this regard
- Not a good place for people who like structure. We provide just enough structure to keep the office from collapsing into chaos. Otherwise, few parameters and boundaries are placed upon people (this also extends to promotions, titles, assignments- these things don't really exist at Palantir). With that said, there are enough checks and balances that one has a relatively clear picture of when they are doing well or not. It is also an extremely transparent organization, so information sought will be delivered.
- The unstructured comment also extends to projects. You are told to do awesome things but given little unsolicited guidance as to how to get there. Again, for many this is a Pro not a Con - but it can be extremely overwhelming to some.
- People are limited versus the work that needs to be done. You will be thrown into the deep end (having to take a meeting on context you don't really know or understand, working on a project where none of your previous experience is relevant) time after time and asked to swim at the Olympic level.

2015-08-17, Forward Deployed Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Where the mission really counts,Where the mission really counts,0,"Let me open with a bit of my own background to add context:
- Been at Palantir for around 3 years at the moment of this writing.
- I've worked at many software companies, including Google.
- Also have an academic background (PhD).

The most unique thing about working for Palantir is working for missions that really matter. Nothing feels like knowing your work is directly responsible for helping others, and preventing bad things to happen. And don't be fooled into thinking that this is a ""drinking the kool-aid"" kind of thing. There's no ""management"" trying to convince me that I'm helping an important cause: I see it by myself and engage on it every single day.

Palantir is also pretty dynamic: structures exist but are super flexible. People are encouraged to work on different projects / teams / countries and help on whatever they can. In my tenure at the company, I haven't spent more than 6 months on a same role and it's hard to pinpoint which was the most exciting amongst them.

The company's culture is another highlight: a typical Silicon Valley company that spares no resource in making sure its employees are taken care of. At the same time, there's still a start-up feel to the company (even though it's pretty global by now) and I feel like I'm as responsible for shaping Palantir as much as anyone else who is here.

Finally, contrary to some rumors I read on the Internet, there isn't really much of a ""cult culture"" to the company. Employees are psyched about the company, it's culture, values and mission: but helping to e.g. reduce human trafficking does that to you. However, there is definitely no idolization of specific leadership personas as it happens on Google, Facebook and Apple.","Palantir is the kind of company where employees are really focused and committed to its cause.
This doesn't mean you need to do crazy hours - most people I know work pretty normal hours and I myself keep my weekends sacred and never work on them. But people are really focused and committed and want to solve problems and make Palantir a better place - as opposed to just ""doing their part"" and going home at the end of the day.

That said, people who want to focus on a ""9 to 5 job and collect the pay check at the end of the month"" don't usually thrive at Palantir.
Again, this is not exactly about working hours - it's about trying to be active in building a company versus not being able to handle the dynamic nature of it.

At Palantir, you won't get an office with your name on the door, your responsibilities will change a lot - sometimes for more, sometimes for less. And you will experience some of the downsides of a loosely structured organization that has been doubling in size every year for the past 8 years.

Also touching the points above, some reviews complain about low compensation packages. Without getting into too much detail: Palantir is a pre-IPO company that doubles in valuation every year and focuses its long-term compensation on the form of company stock, rather than cash payments. Think about that for a second. It is an amazing opportunity for those who are committed to staying in the long term and helping the company grow, but a downside for those who prioritize stability and would prefer a pre-established tech giant like Google.

Bottom line, if you are seeking a 9-to-5 job and are optimizing on the size of the cash paycheck at the end of the month, then Palantir is probably not for you.","I find this really hard to answer.

I know everyone's experience here is different, but if you work hard, are thoughtful about what it is you're doing, and how you're impacting the team - then you generally have a ridiculous amount of opportunities open to you for doing new things.

2015-06-17, Site Reliability Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,“The Only Job I’ve Ever Genuinely Enjoyed,“The Only Job I’ve Ever Genuinely Enjoyed,0,"I’ve worked at a large number of companies and institutions during my career, and I can honestly say that Palantir is the only time I’ve ever derived genuine satisfaction from work.

The work is challenging, and colleagues are smart, driven and likable. There’s an old saying that holds true here: “If you’re the smartest person in the room, then you’re in the wrong room.” This is not how it feels to work at Palantir - you're never in the wrong room. And yet since everyone automatically accepts your value, there’s no such thing as a dumb question, and help is everywhere. Working at Palantir for one year is like working five years anywhere else. Palantir makes you better, and it's virtually impossible not to grow professionally and technically simply by following the examples set by such a high bar.

There’s virtually no hierarchy and everyone has a large amount of autonomy to get the job done. If you identify a problem that no one has addressed, then you’re empowered to do whatever is necessary to fix it.

The kinds of problems being worked on, and the sort of casual discussions that occur around the office, are fascinating. Engineers become fully fledged subject matter experts in order to solve big difficult problems, and there are new and interesting projects being taken on all the time.

The London office is tight-knit with a lot of social activities. The perks include travel and free food, the latter of which should probably be listed under cons as well, since its presence requires self-discipline in order to resist snacking and over-eating.","The work/life balance is not as bad as many people here say, but it certainly isn’t a fixed 9 to 5. My experience is that Palantir attracts a certain type of intelligent, driven individual who work long hours and seem physically incapable of allowing themselves to leave the office until their own task list is complete. Deadlines can exert pressure, but otherwise pressure tends to be self-imposed. Also, people work hard, and the longer day they work the more they get done. And these people tend to have the most cred and to be celebrated as the high achieving rockstars. This can be motivating to some, but daunting to others, depending on the mindset.

In any case, Work/life balance is an issue that is on the table and is taken very seriously.

Palantir really isn't for everybody. No one is here just to pick up a paycheck or to get an easy ride. It's full of hard workers and cautious idealists.",Keep up the two-way dialogue with staff. It's working.,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

2015-06-24, Forward Deployed Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,A platform for personal growth and change,A platform for personal growth and change,0,"Two main reasons why Palantir is unmatched as an employer, both best described as platforms:

1. A platform to drive change in the world. For real, on stuff that matters. There's truly nothing standing in-between you and making a dent at some of the Big Problems out there (energy, terrorism, disaster relief, global economic matters..) Within months of starting your employment (and however junior you may be on a conventional scale) you should expect to have meaningful ownership of something of real world importance.

Note that this isn't only measured in money or managerial responsibility: the company recognizes and calls out what would normally be the unsung heroes of the world. Keep a stack up and stable allowing for intelligence operations to run? Amazing. Forward-deploy and train a group of critical users? Fantastic. The job is very hands-on, and this is _not_ inversely correlated with status (as is the case, I feel, in many other companies).

2. A platform for growth, both personal and professional. Palantir embodies the idea that to change the world you must also focus on changing/growing yourself. Deep introspection is encouraged and assisted through the sharing of some of the most substantive ideas around personal growth out there, contributed from all parts of management and non-management.

Coupled with the lack of hierarchy in Business Development (everyone is either a Forward Deployed Engineer or a Deployment Strategist), you're going to try many different roles throughout your tenure without worrying that it's perceived as a step ""up"" or ""down"" the ladder. It's about aligning your unique skill-set with a place where they get to be the most leveraged. So honesty about strengths and weaknesses is essential (and for many, really hard) but the end result is an incredible acceleration towards finding out what you're truly an outlier at. Then, with the platform for driving change in the world, you get to apply those skills towards problems that matter.","Growing pains exists and are inevitable at the rate of growth Palantir sees. Things break and can be chaotic at times, which in turn can be distracting from the real work at hand. That said, the company is getting significantly better at addressing things more aggressively.","Don't introduce formal hierarchies, even as the company continues to grow. The best part of working in BD, where everyone has the same title, is that progression is purely a matter of actual growth rather than perceived growth. Don't change this. External validation is important but address this through engaging in substantive conversations among people to call out achievements, rather than resorting to rigid and corporate reward mechanisms (like titles).",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2015-07-07, Forward Deployed Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Forged Through Chaos,Forged Through Chaos,0,"Palantir will challenge you. If you want an employer that will let you explore your ability to build, learn, [sometimes] fail, and grow as an engineer, Palantir provides. Opportunities to take ownership and do something awesome (both mission and technology), are everywhere. That said, you have to either take them for yourself or proactively work with your lead as there are no set paths for career growth.

Related to no set paths, Palantir truly understands that every employee has his/her own strengths and weaknesses. While there are titles and defined roles, most are filled by a wide variety of people who specialize in various different ways within the role. If you're smart and have good judgment, Palantir has a place for you where you will get to build what you're good at and be valued for it.

The mosaic of employees is exciting. Palantir of course has it's fair share of university built computer scientists, but I regularly have the opportunity to talk with physicists, ex-military, comic artists and other varieties of people. Basically because we work in so many different areas of the world (healthcare, energy, defense, anti-money laundering, etc.), our employee diversity matrix is incredible and unrivaled. In all honesty, I think this is my favorite part about Palantir; there are fresh, interesting people everywhere.","Some days are exhausting. With the chaotic ""take ownership"" nature of the company, it can often feel like guidelines are missing.

Your fate can be in your own hands especially with a newer lead. You need to make sure your lead understands your skills and wants, so that he/she help you find the opportunities and problems you want. There are no checklists for promotion or growth which can suck, but also means bureaucracy won't hold you back. This is the chaos, but it comes with so many advantages I think it's worth.

Work-Life balance is in your own hands. Many people in the company struggle with it, and you'll have to make your own rules to keep the balance you need. For example, one of my rules is no weekend flights for business. People are supportive but not necessarily proactive in helping. This might be slowly shifting. That said, if you find and stand by the rules that work for you, it's excellent.","Continue providing opportunities for ownership to everyone who's shown good judgment (and perhaps push them a little faster than currently), and Palantir will continue growing and thriving.",4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
2015-06-20, Forward Deployed Engineer,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Variety and autonomy like nowhere else,Variety and autonomy like nowhere else,0,"If you're a driven person, the opportunities to take ownership of complex problems here are peerless. This week, I've been shaping the architecture of our trader-oversight platform, building an automated test framework, speaking to the CTO of a major bank about our technology, and spinning up a brand new dev team. Oh, and organising the London office's next beer-tasting outing. Meanwhile a friend/colleague of mine is simultaneously figuring out how to use machine learning to solve data-quality issues in the insurance industry, and coordinating the spin-up of Palantir's next European office.

All of the above happens because Palantir's culture is one of decentralised autonomy. You are given the freedom to entirely manage your own schedule, to identify things that need fixing (both internal and external) and then run experiments to address them.

Our culture is also one that fosters an insanely tight global community of smart, interesting, passionate people. Everyone on my team has an interesting story to tell, and has something that they do far, far better than I ever could. There are few companies of this size where literally anyone can literally send an email to a director to tell them when they're wrong (and indeed, are positively encouraged to do so).

NOTE: I wrote this review as part of an initiative to correct the current skewed/unrepresentative status quo of UK reviews here. That said, everything you read here is reality as I see it; no one else has vetted or influenced my words.","The company (and the London office in particular) is scaling incredibly fast, which is not without its costs. Many things used to come for free, but we're now learning how to stay on top of the tech debt of complex projects, and to tackle a decrease in general employee awareness of what's going on around the company and how we're sticking to our mission. We're also working hard to ensure that new starters don't get lost in the chaotic, ever-changing world that is life at Palantir.

The variety I talked about above goes hand-in-hand with drive/passion. If you're accustomed to being handed things on a plate, then your experience at Palantir may end up very different, especially in BD. There is often a lot of boilerplate work to be done (but of course, the interesting challenge is to find ways to reduce this.)

The culture and work ethic is not for everyone, especially versus the European norm. 40-hour weeks are something of a minimum in practice, but for most people here that's an acceptable trade-off to work on important problems, with amazing colleagues.",,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

They are not saving the world. They are selling a very similar product to one that IBM, BAE, and several other companies sell. Nothing more.

It's slightly scary when you speak to Palantir employees. Their eyes are glazed over as they repeat the company mantra that they are saving the shire.

- Good perks, especially house subsidy and free food (go out and buy whatever you want reasonably).
- Smart and energetic colleagues.

I worked for 2 different teams and my experience was very different:

Team 1:
- Experienced lead with great technical knowledge, very good communication and quick, actionable feedback.
- Work load is reasonable.
- Colleagues are very friendly and great to work with.
- Probably one of the most pleasurable teams to work with.

Team 2:
- The work is more interesting than team 1's.
- The product is used by several important organizations.","Overall:
- ""Flat hierarchy"" is a joke, leads with absolute power are big dictators. You will never have a chance to talk to lead of your lead and there are 3 or 4 people on the top of the hierarchy if you are a software engineer.
- Way understaffed.
- Devs in satellite office are very dependent on devs in headquarter.

Team 1:
- The project is a bit tedious, not very distinctive from what many other startups are doing.

Team 2:
- Possibly the worst software management I have ever experienced.
- Very inexperienced, political, terrible, close-minded and hypocritical lead: doesn't understand the tasks technically, constantly sets unreasonable expectations, judges people at every detail inside and outside of work, thinks documentation is a waste of time, takes constructive feedback very personally. I am not sure why he is in the tech industry, Wall St may suit him better.
- There is little to no mentorship when you get into a new team.
- Every word you speak can be used to go against you when needed.
- Frequently burnt out due to unreasonable expectations (working up to 5AM to meet lead's expectation is a norm).
- Many egoistic colleagues are close-minded, unwilling for help and debate for better ideas.
- Literally no documentation, you will waste most of your time to comprehend code that is done at 2AM without any support.
- The work itself is not hard, it is hard because you are going to work alone without any documentation.
- Testing and release process is a joke.
- Performance Improvement Plan is an absolute play. If your lead doesn't like you, even if you complete your PIP successfully, he will extend it until he can find a small fault (or maybe not even a fault) to force you out. If you are ever put under a PIP and feeling your lead doesn't like you, make sure choose to quit for better benefits as you will be fired at the end anyway.
