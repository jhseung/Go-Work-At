2018-10-02,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Love working at Insightly!,Love working at Insightly!,0,"I've been working at Insightly for a while on the sales team. It is a great place to progress your career, learn, have fun, and make some money while doing so. Management truly cares about each individuals' success and makes an effort to get to know everyone on a personal level. My team makes me excited to come to work every day. Promoting from within is a priority for management and the company as a whole.","We hired too fast for a bit and as a result, hired some people we probably shouldn't have that were not invested in their own success and not a culture fit. These people are no longer with the company but are probably the cause of some of the bad reviews.","Hire the right people, continue to focus on promoting people internally and not changing the culture",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-08-20,,,Former Employee ,It's been fun and it's been real.,It's been fun and it's been real.,0,"The joy of working at Insightly stems from the people you meet. These relationships turn into friendship even after you leave their office for the day or move on to the next chapter of your career. It's a place where managers sit closely with their members and enable them to be successful. PeopleOperations (otherwise known as HR and Recruiting to the outside world) helped build Insightly, along with leadership's support and many team members' help, into a diverse, inclusive, fun, and engaging startup. It's one of a kind.

When you enter the office, you're greeted by the best Office Manager with her smile. You can grab a light breakfast, snacks, hot coffee/tea, drinks from the kitchen's pantry area. You will see each pod's unique style of decor like a hanging Lannister of Casterly Rock banner, a giant $1M sign, shady green leaves, a wall mounted bell that echoes loudly, and the quiet diligence of everyone striving to grow the business. Sometimes a furry Co-founder might say hi and search for food. Then lunch time hits and everyone is heading out to Barry's together, getting Lee's for the 3rd time in the same week, standing in line to warm up their food, and catching up on each other's lives. Afternoon rush ends and you return to work, 1:1, maybe a quick post-lunch ping pong game to stir up creativity, or your next meeting. It's closing time soon but some people are thinking of their evening plans to hang out after work.

It's a small 1 floor at Insightly and you're in for a treat if you aim to develop yourself, make an impact, and earn the respect of your peers. Come work at Insightly to learn a whole lot about CRM, the tech stack, a SaaS startup lifestyle, and build lifelong relationships (and friendships).","Granted that not all startups are perfect, they can come close. There is always room for growth. A while back, each department aimed to grow its size to scale operations so PeopleOps team staffed each department in a fast amount of time. Teamwork, camaraderie, and a dynamic strategy got us there. Suddenly, we hit a snag with what we aimed to do: scale.

When a startup expands, so should infrastructure, onboarding, ramp up time, and strategy. The people that have stuck around for the longest time can have insights, best practices, and experience so they can be the biggest resource. Uplevel the tenured people and show them how much you value their contribution to learning & development tools, new opportunities, and an exciting vision. New leadership needs to bring new energy to jumpstart the team rather than the feeling of shock. Then keep that energy going.

Nonetheless, Insightly shares the same growing pains as any other startup in a market that's saturated, competitive, and costly. After my initial months, I learned a lot through researching CRM, sharing knowledge, and asking questions about what I don't know in order to keep the edge at work. This is where a strong and continuous onboarding program comes in and needs the full support of leadership to execute. Here are some things we needed: an articulated company vision, domain expertise modules about SaaS CRM, catchy value propositions, and a robust mission statement are a few quintessential to show remind everyone why they come to work every day.","Keep sharpening Insightly's edge every day. It's a great company with a head-turning story that outsiders are willing to hear and get behind.

Leaders, always invest in your people because they are your biggest ROI. Show them how you wanted to be treated when you were in their position. Onboarding is such a crucial step in the new hire or current employee's life cycle. A best practice is to make things better than the way it was founded.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Review process was prehistoric. It was said that you might get a raise every two years and it was CEO approved. Designation or spreading of power was virtually non existent, like almost everything had to go up the flag pole.","As former Apple CEO Steve Jobs famously said “it doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.” Especially in a growing market this mentality is more than a motivator for your employees, it's a key to success.",2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0

Only takes a few bad apples to skew reviews!,0,"In all transparency, I do not work on the sales team. I have been working at Insightly for a while, and I like my team and the culture in the company. I read a few of the last reviews and it made me think since we hired so quickly, some of the people that left were just not the right fit for the company. In my time here, I felt that we hired better people when HR was more involved in the process and had more say. …

I don't want it to be hard to find good talent for my team because of a few bad apples. I think ""HR"" can only do so much. Seeing this in many companies prior, it is mostly the managers that need to be accountable.","If you come from a big company your values will be different.

It seemed like the teams have morale from sales to CS to engineering. The perks side of things are great, anyperk, stocked kitchen, great PTO, etc which is something that people of course love. The product has made some major improvements over time but of course always room for more. There is some room for growth but it's only recently been a little more transparent.","The CS team has amazing feedback after talking to thousands of customers however this feedback is not really taken into consideration by the main product decision maker which happens to be the CEO. It feels like there isn't a sense for who the product is for so the company is pulling in multiple directions and not making substantial progress. Although it always seems like there is exciting features coming out, the launches are always lack luster and never as desirable. I saw some great plans by a former designer and those were easily dismissed unfortunately.","Your employees want to stick around and help make the product great but managers need to be role models/mentors, not micro managers and help the employee grow so they stay with the company.",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
2018-02-07, Account Executive,,Current Employee ,A Truthful and Accurate Account of Sales Team,A Truthful and Accurate Account of Sales Team,0,"WOW! There are some wildly varied reviews here. It is quite clear that some have been written by HR and others have been by scorned sales reps. I am in fine standing with the company and will give a fair assessment of my experience thus far. Pros- My colleagues are similar in that they are high quality, talented and compassionate individuals. It is a pleasure working alongside them from a personal standpoint. HR has and is doing a great job of finding that cultural match. We also have the standard SF start up perks you would expect.","The cons are pretty simple. The vast majority of the team are not even close to their quotas. This causes unrest on the sales floor, lowering the morale of the group. Mix in PIPs with no explanation to the team on how those are being decided and now we have any angry/confused team with low morale. Finally add in the fact that managers need to get to their team quotas, numbers are low, and so they are micromanaging EVERYTHING a rep does. So to recap, the sales floor currently is filled with angry/confused, micromanaged, low morale team members.","It is not too late. There are problems on every sales team. If you come up with reasonable and realistic solutions to get your teams to goal a vast majority of issues will go away. Be transparent. It doesn't help to just say ""we will get this right"", How? How are we going to right the ship? This is not the worst place in the Bay Area to work it is just currently in a very rough spot. It is fixable.

I am a currently employee here, and within the last 2 weeks 4-5 sales reps including our most tenured sales manager has left the company. From the last few reviews saying the culture is great etc... is all a false, which starts with the interview process. They will tell you what it takes in attempt to attain ""top talent"" to work there. Everything is a lie and HR takes it as a joke! When you complain to HR for management violating policies (elsewhere it would be unacceptable), they take it lightly and nothing is done.

We are expanding our market presence beyond small businesses to the mid market. Furthermore, we are shifting from a pure self-service business to a sales-assisted motion. This is a great learning opportunity, but also fraught with challenges and risks.","We are growing perhaps too quickly.

I am really passionate about the SAAS space and I have always been an advocate of a good piece of software making strides to go leaps and beyond boundaries of all others!

The teams are all very passionate and excited from Engineering to Product, Sales, Marketing all the way to Customer Care. I once heard our Head of Recruiting and HR say, that ""behind every great product there are passionate and smart people who love working together to make things happen, and that is who we hire!"" I could not agree more as that is apparent starting from her team to everyone her team brings in and I interview.

My team can be quirky but every addition seems to have passion for the space and love the product! The passion is also very much driven by our CEO.","Growing fast is never easy!

One of them being favoritism. The favoritism is so bad that managers don't even say goodbye to certain employees on their last day. Sorry, not everyone likes to go out and drink.

The second con being lack of career advancement. The company will lie and say they are looking at internal candidates first, but that's just a ruse to fake career growth. For certain departments, employees are treated like second-class citizens with no chance to grow their skills. Be careful what job you take with Insightly because you may have to wait 2-5 years before they even promote you.

Good camaraderie within departments, and some fun personalities to work with.","All of the drawbacks are in Engineering. If you're coming into one of the other areas, you'll probably be happy, at least until Engineering drags everything else down. Management in Engineering is clueless - no knowledge of technology, just knows buzzwords. Micromanaging, absolutely zero delegation, trust, respect, loyalty, or honesty. Employees literally disappear with no notice to the rest of the staff, regardless of if they have quit or been fired. The company has lost well over a dozen employees this year alone, and it's not over. Engineering has lost more people than it has retained. Development process is supposed to be agile, but the management within engineering doesn't follow it or understand it. Hiring standards are relaxed - company is no longer looking for excellence, just obedience. Run far and fast if you're a developer.","Look at the department where most of the people have left from, and you'll be forced to see where in the management structure your problem is. Hint - it's not CS, Sales, or Marketing. Call back the people that have left and ask them to identify the main person that drove their decision to leave; act on that answer. Look hard at Engineering management and decide if you want technical excellence or mediocrity - your employees are good; trust them.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0

Customer Service is a focus of the company. It has all the right stuff for an amazing company, just needs management.","Working from home is discouraged/disallowed. Extremely-high employee turnover. Several employees didn't even last a week, very few in Engineering/Operations will last a year. Unclear communication from management with conflicting priorities. You'll often get directions from two layers of management as if they don't talk to each other. Expect little positive feedback, no opportunities for advancement, no-notice weekend work, and to be replaced at any time. If you make it past 3 months, you might be ok. If you're promised something in an interview, get it in writing, and be prepared to negotiate for your salary. Non-engineering employees seem a little happier.","Focus on productivity, not face-time in the office. Trust your employees. Communicate to the staff. Communicate within management.

Lunch on Friday, massage on Thursday, snack bar and fridge stocked with drinks. Good product and some really great customers.","Customer Service is the claimed focus of the company but it takes a moment for the management team to do anything when customers raise a fuss. Some senior management don't have a clue about what they are doing. There's no trust extended to the employees to do their jobs. If management thinks your work isn't good enough the feedback is anything but constructive. In fact, it's borderline abusive.",Get your act together.

- if you agree with everyone, you'll do great there","- if your opinion is different than the opinion of your manager, forget about your brilliant ideas. They hire you for your impressive background and ability to solve complex problems but once you're there, you have to play the game by their rules. If you choose to speak up about that type of engagement or express a concern about a lack/dysfunctionality of a certain process, your manager might tell you it's all your fault, which will lead to further unpleasant issues.","- invest more not only in company culture but also in team culture. That culture needs to come from team lead. If that person is only concerned about meeting a deadline but doesn't care whether his/her directs are happy or not, that team leader's behaviour will make employees search for better career opportunities.
- create a feedback mechanism that allows employees to share anonymous feedback on their manager. That feedback has to been seen by company leadership. If the submitted feedback is negative, it must be considered and not be used against the employee who submitted it.
- improve PTO policy so people don't have to show up when they're ill. Currently, they have to because if they don't, they'll lose a day off (for those of you who don't know, employees at Insightly get 3 weeks off per year which includes both vacation days and sick time off)",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0
