2019-03-28, Technical Recruiter,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,Great teamwork environment where quality over quantity matters,Great teamwork environment where quality over quantity matters,0,"Small team that works together to support each other. Management listens, is very responsive and open to new creative ideas. It is not about the numbers here...all about quality. Everyone is seasoned recruiters with over 30 years + combined experience. You have the flexibility and freedom to run your desk in a way that works best for you. Also running QASig user group for years which is great community to interact and learn from.

2018-01-03,,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,Hidden Gem,Hidden Gem,0,"Team is small, welcoming, and motivated. People in the office are genuine and share ample opportunities for success. Perfect environment for self motivated, be-bold mindsets. There is freedom to develop a day-to-day process that works for you. Hours are flexible (but because it is a small team, absences are keenly felt so being in the office physically, or readily available by phone/email is by far the preference here). Day-to-day, you couldn't ask for better clients and candidates to work with. Leadership is smart and fosters an open-door policy - plus, they encourage a positive approach to team collaborations which helps create a great atmosphere, and they seem sincerely committed to offering exceptional benefits for all staff and contractors/consultants (paid holidays, flexible PTO, your birthday off paid, affordable healthcare coverage, etc.), unprecedented really, which makes contracting/consulting for Quardev very much like having a permanent, direct-hire, position.","Amazing opportunity but more attention is needed around commission payouts (calculations are not transparent), business development (support is limited), and staff turnover (it is disruptive).","Advice: Invest in a near-real-time Sales/Recruiting commissions dashboard. and Hire temporary contractors to handle key internal projects (data validation, website updates, etc.) - staff is spread thin, especially during peak times, leading to burnout and turnover.

Kudos: Appreciate the many hats you wear, especially the fact that you are willing and able to be super glue - stepping in to keep team motivation and growth momentum high.",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0

invests in on-going education and provides great professional development opportunities.
Solid compensation package
very approachable team to work with",Still working out the kinks in their use of third-party payroll software,"None, Quardev runs a solid contracting firm that stands apart from the myriad other firms in the area. Having worked with the others and encountering truly horrible experiences with them, I can't speak to Quardev's qualities enough.",4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
2018-01-04,,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,Five Star Service,Five Star Service,0,You have the freedom to do your job with no micromanagement. Management is there when you need them and they inspect your work. They are also very supportive and will help when needed. Everyone is approachable which is very important for a small Agile team. The recruiting team understands the industry and have excellent attention to detail. The sales team is very knowledgeable and is aware of what is happening in the market and can communicate technically. There is flexible PTO including your birthday off. You get free fridge access and there is free parking in a great location.,Definitely could use more marketing to get the name out there of what Quardev does so there can be more cool jobs for cool people.,You've been very helpful so far and show willingness to adapt with the changing times of the industry.

2018-01-09, Senior Software Test Engineer,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,Great company for longterm contract work,Great company for longterm contract work,0,"I was a contractor working under Quardev for over two years,was paid fairly and was always happy with the relationship. My recruiter gave me just the right amount of information for me to be successful with the contracted-employer and my Quardev HR was always quick with the right answers when needed. They would provide an annual lunch for all the contractors at the contracted-employer and also an annual holiday party. Also technical presentations were occasionally provided. All of the basics that you'd need for a contracting position were covered. They even provided some paid days off for vacation or sick time.","The paid days off given were more liberal in the earlier part of my time, but shifted towards a more conservative approach as time went on. That's probably the reality of business in general, of course.",Elicit stronger ongoing feedback with your contractor employees and show them that you hear them.,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

There is such fear and resistance to trying anything new, even small scale. To stand out amongst the larger competitors with more $$ to toss into the game the company needs to excel at the quality of what they can provide and this can't happen when they aren't ahead of the market on talent and retention. If you have to insist to candidates and employees that you are a cool place to work, then you really aren't.","Tap into the passion of the people who will do what it takes to make the company great. Be inclusive, celebrate and encourage participation and ideas that are not your own.",2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
