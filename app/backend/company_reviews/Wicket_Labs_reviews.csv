2018-08-27,,,Current Employee ,Taking part in the next TV Revolution,Taking part in the next TV Revolution,0,"The decision to join Wicket Labs was easy after meeting the founders and learning about their vision for TV and the Media industry. I had worked for several large and successful technology companies prior and enjoyed the comfort and perks that came along with it. However, I felt that I was lacking the ability to create and be a part of a team that was changing something for the better. I was looking to evolve and disrupt an old way of doing things. Help a new idea grow and offer something exciting. What fascinates me about working in Media is that we are all consumers of it so it is easy to relate to this market and want to make it better. We are in an interesting time at the intersection of the web, content, and data. Wicket acts as a compass for content distributors, helping them cross the turbulent seas of transition to this new world. By allowing them to better understand and compete for audience, the customer will eventually be the winner. Content itself is information and we have the unique opportunity right now to tap into it on demand, wherever we are. The implications for the society’s growth are massive.","To make a new idea exist you need to displace an old one. This takes time, commitment, and persistence. An established company will offer you consistency, sometimes better compensation, and a predictable order. Start-ups are the opposite, and that is the nature of what makes them great. Its high risk and high reward but you know that you are doing something new and fresh. That said, if you are in a high risk environment and you want to make a change, there would not be a better team to help navigate this uncertainty than Wicket Labs. They are committed to success and have the experience and drive to win. Work is fun.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

As a startup, everyone feels personal ownership of the final product.

Flexible PTO and work from home opportunities.

Management is extremely transparent about the current state and vision of the company.","As a smaller team, projects can be dependent on a single individual, which can be stressful.",,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2018-03-08,,,Current Employee ,First-Class Wicket,First-Class Wicket,0,"Wicket Labs is truly an enjoyable place to work. The office is full of upbeat, creative energy. I don’t think much about taking my work-from-home days because I really enjoy the atmosphere.
My coworkers are motivated and highly intelligent, and always willing to lend a helping hand. I feel well-supported by the direct and transparent management, and our two most senior engineers are great resources who have decades of experience between them.
Both management and the company as a whole have a strong personal growth mindset, and there are ample opportunities to expand knowledge and skills. At Wicket, you might help out on a process or use a language outside of your typical role, take an online course with fellow engineers, and sit in on sales/customer meetings and demonstrations.
Everyone participates in the daily scrum — even the CEO and the sales team — so I feel that I have an informed picture of the company’s direction and standing. I’m excited to have joined Wicket at a relatively early stage, and I look forward to being part of the company as it continues to grow.","The ongoing construction in Pioneer Square can be loud and distracting, but there are options to work in different areas in the building or at home if it becomes too much of a problem.
The offices are snug, typical of what's expected from a startup. I find that I have enough space to be comfortable, but it might be a big change for someone used to having their own cubicle or office.","I hope that as we grow, the company culture stays the same. It may be harder to keep everyone in the loop once Wicket expands, but staying informed in all aspects of the business really helps to keep employees actively invested in its future.",5.0,,,,,

Super friendly, relaxed atmosphere; my dog especially likes it. Big data + TV is a very interesting intersection and we're aiming at the center of it. Great location in the heart of Pioneer Square - we're in the Galvanize building, which is walking distance to light rail, a ton of food options, galleries and several great places to grab a beer. We're venture backed by two of the leading VCs in Seattle so we have support and guidance for the long run.","We're a small team, with a lot to do.
