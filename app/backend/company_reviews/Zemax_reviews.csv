There are significant opportunities for individuals at any level, from recent graduate to senior professional. The culture is one of innovation, enthusiasm, and aggressive growth, which makes it exciting as provides constant opportunities for learning. Goals are also met within a framework of teamwork, collaboration, and cooperation. This is all done while providing wonderful work-life balance. Zemax values the employee as a person as much as a worker.","The company often engages in multiple initiatives at once, which - while exciting - can make it difficult to juggle all of the work.","Don't fear over-communication!

-Work/life balance is respected and flexible schedules are the norm
-Executive leaders seem aligned and clearly communicate company goals (you always know the direction of the company, where sales numbers are at, and how your role plays a part in it all)","The only con for me is that although the benefits package is extremely competitive (yay for 401k matching!), the health insurance isn't the best I've experienced in the Greater Seattle area. The coverage is great but the monthly premiums and copays are more than I've paid while employed at other companies (Full disclosure: I may be spoiled by having 100% employer-paid premiums in the past).",Keep showing your employees that you appreciate their hard work and they will continue to do great things together.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Work-life balance is tops, and everybody comes to work with a smile on their face.","I haven't had many negative experiences personally, but I do think that the way the company approaches corrections to individual performance could be improved. It seems that if an employee isn't performing up to standard, in many cases that employee ends up being terminated or quitting, rather than actually modifying behavior to go on to be more successful in his/her role. There are also times where it outwardly appears that poor behavior goes unmanaged entirely.","We don't yet have great synchronization across the company, so the way that 1:1 manager meetings, constructive feedback, team building activities, interviewing, etc. are conducted varies from one department to the next.

2015-10-20, Engineering Intern,"Redmond, WA",Former Employee ,Summer Engineering Internship,Summer Engineering Internship,0,"The atmosphere in the Engineering Services team is friendly and light-hearted. As an intern, I met almost daily with a mentor to discuss my projects and ask for advice. I never once felt lost when it came to expectations and support. We were given the opportunity to pick which projects we wanted to work on out of a list of 15 as well as pitch our own project idea. The scope of the projects were appropriately challenging and I find myself still using what I learned during my time there in my subsequent jobs.

During the summer I was there, Ken Moore did a series of ""Ken Talks"" on Wednesdays where he would choose an aspect of the Zemax code itself and explain how the algorithms worked on a little deeper level. I found these talks to be enlightening and memorable.","I was one of the first two engineering interns ever hired by Zemax during the Radiant Zemax merger, so there were a lot of hiccups with the hiring paperwork that made the process unclear. It seems their hiring manager who was working with me left during the merger, so I was resent forms that I had already completed.

Having to find my own accommodations in Seattle with a slightly too-small housing and relocation budget was very difficult since my internship only lasted 8 weeks. Leases for that short of a time period are hard to come by and expensive to keep per month. I had to dip into savings to be able to pay a deposit. However, I have since heard that they increased the relocation and housing allowance in response to this feedback I gave at the end of my internship.","From the sound of what the next year's interns told me, it seems management is listening to the feedback it gets from its interns. I don't have relevant advice to give.",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

Zemax is used in an extremely wide variety of applications, and I really enjoy learning about each. We are consistently improving and expanding the software, and as a result we are always learning new things and solving new problems. In addition, we have an awesome customer base of international, highly educated, and innovative people. Interacting with our customers is part of what makes working for Zemax so rewarding. You get to make a real impact in the tech industry, and your efforts are appreciated around the globe.

Environment: The work environment is open and relaxed. It's a small company, so everyone works hard and pulls their own weight. Discussions and collaboration are encouraged. We enjoy our work, and management strongly believes in a healthy work-life balance.

Colleagues: I have a diverse group of colleagues with backgrounds ranging from computational physics to lens design. There are laser experts and software UI experts. I enjoy coming to work each day, and learning from (and with) each of them!

Management: Our management team is incredibly dedicated to the Zemax software and our company as a whole. Upper management consistently makes a point make sure that we feel appreciated and acknowledged. I am encouraged, supported, and pushed to excel to the best of my abilities. I have an immense amount of respect for my manager, and for our CEO. I can't imagine working for and with a better group of people.","Just the location, but this is a small and temporary complaint.

The company is stocked full of highly educated employees. There is a relaxed yet very productive vibe about the place. Everyone gets along and the workday is varied and pleasant. The company develops and sells a fascinating technical niche product, and supports some really interesting and educated customers doing cool stuff. The environment is rewarding, stimulating, and nurturing. Most of the top management (including the CEO) are highly educated scientists and engineers as opposed to business types, and this contributes to the culture of technical excellence that is the life blood of the company.","The company is only about 50 people, so if you prefer a really huge organization this isn't the place for you.

Zemax has managed to cultivate an exceptional team. I have never worked with smarter or more enjoyable people, and I've never before had a boss I actually liked. For the first time in my career, I feel recognized and rewarded when I do a good job.

The leadership team has both technical depth as well as great business acumen, and I feel confident that the business is being directed by people who care about the company and who are in it for the long haul. The recent sale of the company has yielded many improvements, like 4 weeks of vacation time in addition to sick time, 401(k) matching at 4%, short & long term disability, and a complete medical benefits package. I've actually never had such great benefits before. On top of it all, the pay is very competitive.

All in all, Zemax is a great place to work!","The only con for me is that the current office location is far away from everything.

2015-02-06, Sales,"Redmond, WA",Former Employee ,Recent changes for the best,Recent changes for the best,0,"Disclaimer: I worked for this group under the RZ administration. I suspect whichever sour soul posted the critique of Dr. Nicholson probably intended to do so in reference to the CEO of Radiant Zemax because in my 2+ years working for Mark, I never once had any criticism of his ability to lead, to address problems with a physicist's practicality, and promote a fun and laid back environment.

This is a team of truly brilliant people. The management structure of the newly formed company is comprised of technical wunderkinds mixed with the right level of business acumen and experience. If they needed my rather specific skillset, I'd go back in a heartbeat.","Seeing a ladder as a non-physicist is challenging and was one of the reasons I left. As the company continues to grow, I am sure this will come out in the wash.","You're heading in the right direction by decoupling from RZ.

And it's also a fun place to work! The company culture is very open and friendly, with great interaction between all employees, whether that be for professional or personal reasons. Finally, it's also a place where I've found tons of opportunity to contribute in different roles. So there isn't much stagnation or apathy among the employees. Overall one of the best places that I've ever worked!","With a lean company dedicated to delivering the best product and service in the industry, there can be times when the workload is more than full.
