2018-07-13, Project Manager,"Washington, DC",Former Employee ,Not a Stable or Ethical Place,More than a year,0,"The work I was a part of had a decent amount of travel opportunities and a lot of hands on experience, plus (on the surface level) a great culture, but that was really dependent on the people you worked and if you were lucky and on the right side of management making the calls.","If you need and value stability, especially in the Government side, ethics, or advancement due to merit, this isn't the place for you. There were no opportunities to shift within the organization, regardless of the efforts you made as an individual. It is also not a place you want to bring or leverage your network with, as they will be used and burned as other people see fit. The value was always the short, cash-grabbing win, regardless of the cost in reputation, relationships within the community, or professional ethics. After leaving, I and a number of colleagues have had to work against this negative reputation, and I have personally been called out on it in interviews for positions with their former USG clients. And yes, some of the high level leadership (C-suite) has now changed since I left, but that reputation has held true years later within the community.","Don't hire people if you don't have a plan or funding for them for more than a few months, be willing to have tough conversations with the staff you manage if you don't think they are meeting your expectations, stop burning your reputation and staff's networks, and maybe read some books on professional ethics and the FAR.",3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

2018-05-23, N/A,"Washington, DC",Former Employee ,"Poor leadership ran DC into ground, trying to rebound",Less than a year,0,The company has a noble mission supported by smart people.,"The former President ran the DC office into the ground by expanding into a ritzy neighborhood and adding a bunch of people without revenue to support it. Within 9 months, the founding CEO resigned and the DC office was shuttered despite most of the clients being located in DC after not landing a single new client in a year and losing their largest client. It's a shame because it could have been something special. Now the SF office survives on the left coast with orphaned east coast clients. Sales turnover was 100% despite leadership 101 issues making it a lost cause from the beginning. At least the board eventually fired the President (Robert Mann). Not that this helped the people who were hired/poached only to be laid off a few months later.","As you rebuild, focus on your core mission, keep a check on leaders with egos that are detached from reality. An opulent startup easily strays from it's mission. The team didn't do this, but leadership definitely did.",2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

I have gone over 6 months without any assignments, despite many times asking to get more involved in ongoing or future work.
