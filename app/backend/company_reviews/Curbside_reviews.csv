Feel left out in the cold by the rest of the company. Management stops by unannounced to threaten firing you if you are on your phone or sitting.

Work life balance is great.","There was sometimes a lack of direction. There's always a chance for growth but you're largely left alone to find issues, fix them or improve services.

2016-04-09, Curbside Associate,"Palo Alto, CA",Former Employee ,Not so great as an associate,Not so great as an associate,0,"I've met some of the coolest most interesting people during my time with this company. Having great people to work with was really what made my tenure with Curbside worthwhile.

Being a ""Curbside Associate"" is essentially an easy job. When you're not collecting or taking inventory of orders from inside the store you're standing outside passing out flyers and informing potential customers of how the service works.

This was my first time working for a start up company and it was great to see how things actually worked. A lot of going through trial and error runs.

Advancement is there, you just have to be willing to put in the hours.","A lot of the cons from my point of view with the company from an Associate stand point have to do with management and the higher ups and how they conduct themselves.

They create this atmosphere where it feels like they can't trust you so they'll often times show up unannounced and try to catch you off guard. Other times they show up unannounced and not even come by to say ""hello."" They usually watch or peak from a distance and just leave even though you've seen them. Or they will inform you that they will be showing up and not actually show. It's just a passive way of micro managing in my opinion.

Other times people in Lead positions are better at delegating than actually leading by example.

Other cons are that you stand outside in all weather conditions, though that is the nature of the job. They allow you to set up inside the store if it's raining but that's to keep the orders from being ruined and not really so for the benefit of the associate.",From the time I started to the time I left there has been a collective feeling that it's not always a good thing when someone from headquarters comes to visit. Perhaps you guys can work on that feeling of distrust with the associates.,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

2016-01-22, Software Engineer,"Palo Alto, CA",Current Employee ,Great Team and Great Products!,Great Team and Great Products!,0,"Working as a full-time software developer/engineer there currently. Nice packages and benefits! Although it's a startup, its benefits package is even better and more competitive than some of the well-known big companies in Bay Area. The core tech team is not in very big size, but everyone gets to have the fastest way to communicate, inspiring and learning from each other. Lots of the senior-level developers are very experienced professionals from the industry and I get to learn a lot from their help and advices as a new grad. The company is at the stage of fast growing. I think the feeling of making achievement is invaluable, especially when you see that your efforts would boost the number of users and improved their experience with satisfactions. And I would be very happy to see that our product changes the way for ppl to shop soon in the future!","so far couldn't think of any, ill add to it if I really could find any haha",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
