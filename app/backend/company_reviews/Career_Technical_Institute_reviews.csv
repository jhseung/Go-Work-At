2017-05-19,,"Washington, DC",Current Employee ,Job Developer,Job Developer,0,"This is a small company that is on the rise. Yes, it has faced many challenges- what small business hasn't? There was a point in time when they had the wrong leaders in key positions and unprofessional staff members in place. That has changed.

This company is led by an eccentric visionary leader who believes in his staff and is driving this company to grow by leaps and bounds. He rewards hard work and promotes from within. This company also throws fun company events for the employees every quarter.

If you are looking to work hard and be rewarded for that, this is a great place for you. If you are interested in opportunities to grow into management and learn about other areas of business, this is a great place for you. If you are interested in having fun while working hard, this is a great place for you. If you want to contribute to improving the lives of individuals, this is a great place for you.

2016-04-11, Admissions Advisor,"Washington, DC",Former Employee ,Horrible experience,Horrible experience,0,"Extremely laid back atmosphere and metro accesible, convenient to excellent food spots and there are great people who work there but management is a force to be reckoned with.","GHETTO! High turnover in admissions and career services department, no one stays employed there longer than 1 year unless they are friends of someone in senior management. The owner is very impersonal, rude, cheap and a micromanager. He also has a staff that has a ""click/in crowd"" culture and extremely unprofessional. HORRIBLE training. If you are used to working in a professional work environment, this is not the place for you. For this to be an educational facility, they don't care about what is best for prospective students or current students. They only care about ""SALES"".",Maybe the owner should be friendly with new employees and make them feel comfortable. As well as get some quality/ qualified employees with work ethic and maybe your school would not be failing.,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0
2016-03-31, Admissions Advisor,"Washington, DC",Former Employee ,Stay very far away,Stay very far away,0,"Some of the people that work there are decent.

The initial group interview was the most transparent experience of working there. The gentleman made it clear that all positions in the admissions departments (online and on-campus) required being on the phone a lot.

The starting pay is decent. The range is $35,000 - $45,000, but there is no commission.","Turnover rate is terrible. People get fired every week. People generally stay there between 4 - 8 weeks, then they bring in a new batch of admissions advisors (sales people). They attract people with the decent salary, but they never really pay it out because people don't stay there for long. Plus they make money on any enrollments the person completed if the student stays longer than 30 days; their long-term programs such as IT and Nursing Assistant run between 13,000 - 16,000 for roughly 9 months of classes. So, if someone works there for two months, and lets say they make $4,000, but they enrolled three people at $13,000 a person, that's $39,000 they made from one admissions rep. That's a great deal for CTI.

The interview process was highly disorganized. All candidates were made to wait for at least 30 minutes before speaking with one of four people; the waits between each person were just as long. This is inconsiderate to those who drove to the interview and had to re-fill limited 2 hour parking meters in Downtown D.C. or get a ticket. The wait to see the owner of the company, Moses, was nearly an hour as he walked back and forth in front of candidates to have lunch with colleagues and attend to other things, knowing he had candidates waiting. That pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the company - careless.

Training and advising process. They treat education like they are selling cars or a tangible product. Many of the students that go to CTI come from low-income situations and are looking for an opportunity to get an education, but are not well informed about quality of schools. You're told to take advantage of those that seem sad and down of their luck and provide a sense of hope to sell the the programs. A lot of people end up dropping out within 30 days.

No transparency. Management never explained the company's strategy, if there was one, to the sales team. You just never knew what was going on behind the scenes. Managers had almost daily meetings with the owner to explain why targets were not being met, and the meetings generally looked hostile. The room for meetings has glass walls, so management would see who wasn't at their desk when people would get up to use the bathroom or take a quick walk. The company is in shambles.

Office politics. From my first day there staff whisper and tip-toe around the office, staying to their. It's a clique environment. People throw each other under the bus. There was a lot of gossip going on, trash-talking, etc.

Management structure, hierarchy, and support. It wasn't clear who was really in charge in the admissions department; there was a battle for who really ran admissions between two people, confusing the staff who would follow directions from one person only to be told something different from someone else. They provide you with terrible leads of people who don't really want to go to CTI.

Job Security. Managers often threatened admissions advisors they would be fired if they didn't meet their goals, which changed every month without explanation. What they would basically do is see if they could meet a certain number of enrollments and just arbitrarily increase it the next month - that's it. You don't manage people by preying on their fears of losing their job; many people their had families and would come to work filled with anxiety and stress because they're being micromanaged. All phone calls for the admission reps are recorded and can be listened to at any time to see if you're following the script that doesn't work. The amount of phone calls made is also being logged and watched; when courses aren't set to start for a while, you're required to make about 80 phone calls an hour; when classes are about two weeks away from starting, it increases to 130 phone calls an hour.

Nobody wants to attend this school. The quality of the education is low, and I doubt employers are actively looking to hire many people from CTI.

Poor and unethical practices. They provide leads that can be over a year old; they give multiple admissions reps duplicate leads, so you and two other reps are basically calling the same person multiple times a week; they don't place people on the do not call list when requested - that's illegal. I spoke to at least 20 - 30 people a day who claimed they had requested that CTI not call them anymore. They give the fresh leads to certain people; there's favoritism going on.

Just stay away from this company, if you can afford to. It's a terrible company and they just hire and fire people",Be more transparent. Communicate the company strategy to employees.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
