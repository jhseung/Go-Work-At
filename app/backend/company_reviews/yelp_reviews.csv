2019-01-01, Account Executive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,"Amazing People, Incredibly Unhealthy Work Environment, HR Nightmare","Amazing People, Incredibly Unhealthy Work Environment, HR Nightmare",0,"I am writing this review 6 weeks after leaving Yelp and about 4 at my new company so I feel like I have had some time to digest, compare, and reflect on my experience.

THE GOOD:
People - A pro and a con, we will get to that later. I have made some of my dearest friends and amazing mentors working there. Everyone is around the same age, has similar goals as you, and for the most part your peers encourage you to succeed.

Office- The office is beautiful and filled with snacks, beer and games. There's a barista there all day everyday and a great facilities team that keeps the office shiny.

Events - Again, pro and con. Drag queen lunch, happy hours, team outings, you name it. There were a ton of fun events that I know people who were not from the NYC area really benefited from since they got to meet new people and explore cool new spots around the city.

Training - Yelp offers a 2 month, extremely intensive training program that teaches you the ins and outs of sales. You learn to become a better communicator, have thicker skin, and set goals.","***IMPORTANT***
Let the record stand that in September there was an attempted SHOOTING at Yelp in SF and NOT A SINGLE MESSAGE was sent out until 3PM three days later after employees were panicking/gossiping about it.

Our stock plunged nearly 30% in Nov. Business owners were talking about it on our calls and not a single person in management or leadership addressed it.

Buckle up, because there are many.

1. Culture- This company is ran like an elementary school or a dysfunctional summer camp. There is an ongoing joke about how we're surprised we don't have to raise our hands to use the restroom. I totally understand things like being mindful of breaks and your phone, but there have been times were I took my phone out to check on a family emergency and got publicly called out for it. The culture at Yelp is shoving it down your throat that you LOVE Yelp and you are SO LUCKY to be working at Yelp. Our monthly meetings would involve bashing other companies (ex., the head of the office mocked Google's walk out against sexual harassment) and avoiding obvious issues within the company. You are HIGHLY encouraged to attend happy hours frequently and majority of the well performing teams, such as the one I was on, go out multiple times a month. Most of it comes out of YOUR pocket and can fall on weekends and Friday nights. Successful managers at Yelp consider Yelp their life (date within the company, have only friends within the company, etc.) I know more about my managers sex life than I ever should.
2. Job Itself - It's cold calling, you know that when you apply so that shouldn't really be a con, HOWEVER, it's how they approach cold calling. At exactly 8:30 you need to be at your desk ready to go. At exactly 12:00 everyone takes lunch (HR says you can take it anywhere between 11-2 but good luck trying to tell your manager that). They have no flex when it comes to a sales cycle. If it's the day before Christmas or the day before Memorial Day weekend they expect the same despite the obvious fact that sales globally decrease. Your managers get on your calls and feed you line for line what you should be saying. Essentially you are a puppet to your manager. It takes zero skill. (For reference, I was putting up 30k a month which is 10k higher than quota.) No matter how much you do in a day/month/week/etc. it isn't enough and even when you do well, no one is happy there, they just can't tell you that. I know several people who have won the most esteemed awards at Yelp and all HAVE QUIT. You're forced to stand and your desk and ""bring the energy"" like we're 12 year old cheerleaders. The ""rewards"" they give you for closing deals is hilarious. Sometimes it's things like ""dare your manager to do a push up!"" or ""one free breakfast sandwich!"" Again, elementary school. There is also nowhere to go up. You can either cold call, manage people who cold call, do higher volume cold calling, or pray to get into Mid Market/National. I quit the leadership development program because the mission of it is to teach you how to brainwash employees and use what they say against them. Why should managers be asking me questions like ""Are you closer with your mom or your dad?"" ""How is your current relationship going?""
3. Management - Possibly the worst part of this job. It's amazing how they haven't been sued yet because not only is management known for being incredibly unprofessional, but there is NO DIVERSITY. Every single director (in my time I've seen 8 different) is white. Every. Single. One. This is a company of 1200+ employees and you're telling me there isn't ONE POC you can promote? Managers are the same and they're all 23-25. They promote people into management extremely early and they are managers for training classes so you're forced to learn from someone who doesn't even know how to do their job. In addition, management is incredibly immature, power hungry and an overall mess. I went though 4 different managers, all equally problematic. One time there was a bad snowstorm and they were closing down Port Authority and suspending trains. I was told I should ""stay at a friends house"" or use my PTO if I wanted to leave. I wound up staying, it was extremely dangerous getting home and I didn't get back to my house until 2AM with work the next day. Another time I was in the bathroom with a stomachache for FIVE minutes (sorry TMI) and my manager texted me ""Hey where are you?"" I've been told by countless people in power that we should 'of course' take our LEGAL 10 minute breaks, but make sure we earned them. This has been said to me at the end of a week where I've closed 21k. Seems like I earned it. Oh, and one more thing, keep an eye on your managers and directors because they're sleeping with reps and doing obscene amounts of Adderall.
4. The pay structure - Yelp went from contracts to non-term length commitment so the client can cancel anytime. You have no connection with your clients after you sign them up, and it's frowned upon to check in on them. Yelp pays you out as if they stayed signed on for 6 months so when they cancel (which they do because the product is outdated and doesn't actually work) you wind up owing the company back money. They tell you 20% of your sales needs to stay on for 3 months which seems easy but is not when they can stop and start at any time and you have no control.

Honestly, not the worst place to start for recent grads but check yourself and realize this is not a real job and other companies are laughing at us.","1. Stop promoting only white people. It's incredibly obvious.
2. Grow up -- flirting with your employees is embarrassing and unprofessional
3. Take a good look at the morality of how you're running your company.
4. Your trophy winners are quitting -- shouldn't that tell you something?
5. Stop bullying people when they choose to go elsewhere. Don't tell me I'm 'giving up' or 'if you can't be successful/happy here, what makes you think you will be successful elsewhere?' or 'you're feeling negative because you surround yourself with negative people.' I brought a positive, professional attitude to work every day and it was a huge shock when I left. If you really can't see beyond your employees attempts at faking it until they make it, you shouldn't be in management. There are people at this company with anxiety, stomach issues, weight gain, etc. and no one changes a thing. I've seen doctors in NYC that have said people come to them with similar issues from Yelp.

Lot of traffic, lot of load, lot of things you will probably never going chance to work with and issues resolve working for a startup.
* Yelp is not one of FAANG and generally speaking a medium sized business. Engineering department looks fairly lean. This mean it is quite unlikely board is going to dump hundreds of workers in the end of a year to improve financial reports - practice quite common in big companies.
* Can't tell about other departments but culture in engineering is nice and chill. I worked as a contractor with big companies previously and it was a breath of a fresh air since I've joined Yelp.
* Opportunities for growth - plenty of them.
* Yelp is a public company, you are not paid in promises, shares you get are convertible to real money instantly.
* Office - a skyscraper in the downtown SF limits ability to build an open space and you can actually make your/team space quite cosy.
* On-call schedule is not brutal.
* Downtown SF - plenty of opportunities before/after work - concerts, bars, tech meetups.","Most of them apply to the folks who plan to work in the office. Can tell nothing for remote folks.
* You won't buy a lambo after IPO - the company is already public.

* No dry cleaning service.
* No gym
* No showers (critical if you're biking)
* No Uber/Lift credit to get to/out of office. You pay for your transportation/parking yourself. You can pay for Bart/Muni/parking pre-tax though.

2019-03-08, Sales Executive,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,roller coaster of sales,roller coaster of sales,0,"Working at Yelp in this particular position if local sales is 3.5 stars, let me Explain:
The good - the good is the overall culture, and the supportive nature of management - at least from what I have experienced. We are well caffeinated, decently fed, with ample time off and a work life balance. And if you do well, you can make great money after your first or second year. I earned an 18,000 raise in two years , not including commission. I’m on track to make $90k if I bust my hump, $65k if I barely try . It’s extremely diverse and inclusive and we celebrate that at Yelp. I’ve also been around and recognize with benefits and the culture that I’m getting a lot for “free” and that includes health care which is amazing and a wellness benefit of a few hundred a year. So it’s a financial win for me for sure.

It’s a fun place to be, and a positive attitude is must .","The Bad: not everyone has great managers, and sometimes morale can suffer. When rumors fly they go quickly and inaccuracies abound. Some managers are super responsive to other teams and team memebers, some managers don’t smile , welcome or acknowledge you if you are not in their team even if you’re part of the same director group and they see you every day. In my opinion all managers should appear welcoming and inviting to everyone. They are leaders ! Leaders can lead strangers too!

The Ugly: Sales is a hard job. You’re calling people on the phone selling them advertising tht many times they don’t want or don’t know that they need. You get hung up on a lot, people cuss at you, say mean things. So that is very challenging but I’ve become more thick skinned at least. I love where I work, I don’t really like my job.

PTO, Kitchen, great location.","The sales strategy they have in place is over the top. I get it from an economic standpoint to maximize profit but I am convinced it will hurt Yelp in the long run. The fact that we call the same business's over and over again until they hate Yelp so much will backfire and is represented in the stock price to an extent. Think about it, there's only a finite amount of local businesses out there. And the more bridges Yelp burns, the less opportunities there will be years from now.

Next, is the fact that the product is mehh at best. Sometimes it can produce results, sometimes it will not produce any jobs at all. However, that is advertising in a nutshell. One of the big indicators of their success is the market they are in. But don't worry because ""every territory is the same and Yelp works for every industry out there!"" Luckily, I had okay territories over my tenure but to say they are all the same is the biggest lie. Manhattan compared to middle of Ohio is not comparable and you will see some reps having trouble hitting their numbers because of this.

One of my biggest issues with Yelp’s sales strategy is the high pressure sales tactics to force business owners to put down a credit card that day. Absolute bonkers to me. Why today? Because you don't want them to do their own research because they may stumble upon the great reviews in the Yelp For Biz Owners (1.8/5). Furthermore, Yelp blocks people from writing comments on their Youtube videos (Why Does Yelp Recommend Reviews). Pretty funny, when Yelp is known as a review site, but will censor people’s voices about Yelp when the opportunity rises.

Additionally, the pitch is very misleading, you will hear the number 92 way too often and when you actually read the results of the study it is very vague as 92% of people make a purchase ""sometimes, frequently or almost always"" after visiting the site. Raises questions as to how spread out to how many people selected sometimes compared to almost always.. would be interesting to see the full study rather than the Yelp crafted post in the Yelp blog. Also, we will have ‘X’ amount of opportunities to show your Ad which will be targeted. Then you will see how many searches have happened in that area and it will be 1/50th of the amount of opportunities. (Grant it I know a lot of these opportunities will be on competitors pages but a fair amount will be showing up in categories that is not relevant for that business at all. Yes they won’t be billed if no one clicks on it but I do find it a little shady.) Furthermore, you will hear reps lie and lie about some current advertiser and some success story, and this is all because the managers and higher ups feed you these lines to lie over and over again to make a sale. We talk about selling ethically, but then we will lie and skip over details of what the Cost per click is and so forth.

Also, Yelp is a veryy liberal company. There has been times when the higher ups will bash Trump during the company meetings for no reason and just really push their agenda. I don’t care who you vote but it is annoying having people push their political agenda. I believe politics doesn’t need to be discussed at work unless it was actually affecting the work we are doing. Yet, Yelp thinks differently and at times make you feel out of place if you lean right..",Better commission structure.

You have to be a slight psychopath to be good at the job. You have to not care about harassing business owners because like it or not that’s what we do. Managers tell you the same things every single day because there’s really not much to change tactically once you memorize the script. Dont get me wrong. It can be extremely uncomfortable to follow word for word because asking for a business owners cell phone number 4 times can be uncomfortable! The only thing you can do is change you MINDSET. Ah, changing your mindset. Yelp loves this phrase! Honestly it means you just have to turn your emotions off! Dial down, push people, and be “assertive”.

The turnover here is ridiculously high. From my training class of 80 people only 5 remain 1.5 years later. It is also incredibly disheartening to see terrible reviews about Yelp all over the media. Look at the Yelp For Business Owner review section or their FB, LinkedIn, or Instagram pages.",Hire people that work at Yelp for more than a year!!

-I’ve met some great people and made some amazing friends working here.
- They have a lot of snacks and drinks to choose from.","Where to begin...

- Management:
Management here is a complete mess. They promote people who are in their early 20’s and have zero experience. Every person on my team has been yelled at, publicly shamed, and forced to stand up at their desk to” bring energy”.
They encourage you to guzzle Red Bull and coffee to stay wired, and will berate you for taking your LEGAL breaks, and micromanage you to no end.
I have witnessed managers on multiple occasions reading people’s google ping messages behind their back, and even once saw a manager pick up an employees phone and start reading their texts. They are all a walking HR violations.

-Culture:
The selling tactics managers encourage are downright sleazy, misleading, and borderline harassment.
You are encouraged to call business owners multiple times a day for months on end, lie about who is calling to get to an owner, and sound misleading as possible when it comes to what the program offers, and pricing. There is absolutely no respect for your clients and no relationship building. You’re supposed to see them as dollar signs vs people, and never acknowledge any of their real concerns. You are a used car salesman making a lot less money.
Your manager forces lines to you over the phone, and basically bully biz owners into buying a program that usually fails them.
The quota structure and charge backs are basically In place to make sure the company pays you as little as possible on top of a minuscule 40k base.
PTO is minimal and you’re supposed to log every single hour.
They will consistently tell you all territories people are calling into are equal, and it’s all about “mindset”. THIS IS A LIE. Calling into a tiny rural town, and calling into SF, are NOT equal. This will make or break your career here.
Calling in sick is looked down upon, and your manager will text you to come in half day even if you are dying of a fever.
You are forced to make 80 dials a day, NO MATTER WHAT. Your manager will remind you of this maybe 59 times a day, minimum.
Revenue trumps everything, even your mental well being and health.
This place is a gossip mill, managers included.
Upper management will never acknowledge any negative news or struggles the company might be facing. There is a very creepy propaganda style mentality that everything is always sunshine and rainbows despite stock plummeting, active shooter scares, the hiring freezing, the Billion Dollar Bully documentary coming out, and other issues.

If you’re even considering leaving the company, or ask any real questions, they will belittle it all. Do not let them convince you that Yelp is the be all , end all. They will try to brainwash you into thinking it’s the best place to work and you’re lucky to be there. DO.NOT.BELEIVE. THEM.
If your top performers are quitting as soon as they can, there’s a problem here.","- Stop hiring managers based on just their numbers, and try to take into consideration their maturity and organizational skills.
-Be transparent about what’s happening within the company, and stop trying to sugar coat things and sweep it under the rug.

2019-03-06, Account Executive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,mentally crippling,mentally crippling,0,"As a disclaimer, a few of the pros I’m about to mention at Yelp inevitably turn into cons, but nonetheless I will include them to show the downward sloping trajectory. It’s a fun job to enter out of college, most people are sharing the same experience: twenty-somethings freshly graduated and awkwardly transitioning into the “corporate world.” Everyone is hyped up on the promise of uncapped commission, happy hour incentives, and a lax work environment. Additionally, it looks good to have Yelp on your resume to new employers - it shows tenacity, the ability to work collaboratively, a competitive nature, and grit. All of these aforementioned qualities look great aesthetically.","I’m going to make an attempt to be as unbiased and neutral as possible here as I lay out my experience at Yelp over the past 8 months. I want to focus on the toxic culture this company breeds, as that should more or less cover the extensive list of cons I have about this company. This toxicity directly stems from the systemic lack of parallel and perpendicular transparency within Yelp. The former issue lies within the transfer of power and communication within said hierarchy: in my case, one director oversaw over one hundred account executives and about a dozen managers. I hesitate to state the obvious here, but that disproportional ratio inverts itself by looking at the larger number (in other words, the account executives) as one whole unit, instead of its proportional parts. We are quite literally treated as a number because our job is to produce numbers (quota) for the company. Now the latter issue lies across the departments of the company, and this can be summed up more succinctly. We don’t have a communications team, which leads to disjointed expectations and promises. There is little to no opportunity of upward movement within Yelp (unless you consistently hit your number and want to interview for a management position, which is half a step up from being an AE) it’s an endless cycle of dials, deals, and gong hits.

Besides the politics, nepotism, and murky values of Yelp there is one thing that drove me mad: the invariable monotony. 80 dials and over 2 hours of talk time is what is expected of us each day, and once you start treating humans as numbers all logic goes out the window. We follow a script as if it’s bible, are trained to combat “objections” (aka instructed to never take no for an answer), and if you question if this is the right job for you, you’re told you “just need to give it time because it is.”

For me the biggest problem didn’t lie in the lack of professionalism or respect I felt personally, it was how slowly but surely I realized I was morphing into the very thing I resented all along. I actually began to forget that the business owner’s I was calling and emailing thrice a week had actual life problems, and that these aren’t just “objections” to combat. No time? Let me just show you one thing. Driving? No problem just pull over and we can do this on your phone. No budget? I’m not asking for any money today! Death in the family? My condolences, when would be a good time for you to reschedule? I started to treat people like robots, and just like I was one of over 100 reps, each phone call and person on the other end was just one of the at least 80 other dials I had to make that day.","Don’t hire such large training classes, it catalyzes the high turnover rate here because it’s impossible to feel important or individualized. Be more transparent, be truthful about the commission structure and day-to-day of the job. Everything within this role is spoken in generalities: training, advice, progression, etc. If you want employees to stay longer, talk subjectively: listen to their personal needs, concerns, and questions so they feel at least some sense of importance.",2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0

Directors and managers only care about the top performs. If your not good luck getting help from them. They will make your struggle for real to help. In training was told it’s in possible to get fired for not hitting your numbers. Well that’s a lie. I have known so many people getting fired for not hitting their numbers. Parking is a freaking mess. You don’t get an assigned spot until 10-11 months in. Which your in the mercy of Scottsdale PD.
Instead of hearing the business owners its sell sell sell. No relationship building for them to even trust us. God forbid if you move Off the script. It’s like the WWIII.

The biggest turn off, the review dump in November. Its clear every business owner and sales reps knew something happened overnight. I had a customer I was working with the night before that had 15 reviews on their page and the next day 2 reviews. The rest un recommended clearly something happened and Corporate wouldn’t say anything. We are the voice of Yelp and when we call we should be able to dig deep into customers issues but nope it’s to turn them into a sale. Push push push. Then if it’s clearly not a good fit it’s what did you do wrong. You didn’t get their need or value. No it’s not a good fit for that business owner. You can’t win them all but it’s wrong if you don’t.

I feel bad for some business owners cause you have several sale departments calling them all at the same time. It’s non sense. You should have all sales people be able to sell all the products for a one stop solution. Not have 6 departments calling them. They even have an up-sell department to call them and make them spend more money on ads.

They don’t listen to their paying customers. Listen to the business owners and figure out what the platform mean to them. It’s an amazing tool but lacks human touch and too far gone in the politics.","Read

the action or practice of inflicting severe pain on someone as a punishment or to force them to do or say something, or for the pleasure of the person inflicting the pain. Yelp hits every aspect of this definition.

Do you know what Guantanamo Bay is? It’s yelp, the United States government sends terrorists to yelp to work in order to extract valuable information out of them. It’s like mental warfare.

In all seriousness, yelp is hell. When you first start you will be amazed by the modern office and culture. As the days and weeks go on you will find yourself waking up less and less excited for work. Your happiness will be sucked from you and your only happiness will come from the freedom of Friday evenings.

You’re expected to make 80 dials minimum a day along with 2.5 hours of talk time. If you fail to do so you will have meetings with managers and possibly directors to figure out the problem. You will find on the phones that no one wants to speak to you EVER. You must kick and scratch your way to speak to anyone about yelp and even then they are weary about signing up. You spend 8 hours of your day on the phone with minimal interaction with coworkers because of the stress to hit your numbers.

Eventually you will consider quitting, without another job lined up because you have reached rock bottom and hate who you are as a person. I am still in this boat, but have another job lined up making double the money, just waiting out the last few weeks before I make my glorious exit and never look back.

The mental stress from this job is not healthy. There will be days that you will be on the cusp of a mental breakdown because of the thought of speaking with a business owner who has cussed you out 7 times before for calling.

The commission structure is a joke. Must sell 30k before commission is unlocked and then each month after must sell 12k before you even see a commission check. At 20k you get a $1000 check but after taxes it’s 600-700. They will show you the top reps in the company making 100k-200k but it’s only a select few who get lucky territories and inbound calls. Most reps in the company don’t hit their number. It’s an obvious flaw in yelps structure if so many people miss. There are so many other sales jobs that are less stressful and have more aggressive pay.

1) The the job is simply boring.

You're required to (at minimum) call 80 businesses a day (most you just called two days ago) and try and get someone on the phone. It's no wonder why businesses don't want to work with Yelp simply because we call them SO MUCH. 2.5hrs of talk time is also required of you and if you don't reach that then you're questioned as to why you're not ""extending conversations."" Well..because I have other businesses to call that might want to ACTUALLY SIGN UP rather than answer dumb questions like ""how's the weather"", that's why.

""But, did you bring value?""
""Yes""
""So why didn't they sign up?""
""If I knew why they would have signed-up, now wouldn't they?""

2) The god-awful incentives.

""Three deals and go home!""
""Get to our number and we'll have breakfast in the morning!""
""Close a deal and leave at 5 on Friday!""

STOP OFFERING INSULTING EARLY DISMISSALS.

STOP OFFERING FOOD AS AN INCENTIVE.
I'M NOT HUNGRY, I WANT MONEY IN MY POCKET.

Dangle REAL money in front of people and they're more motivated to do what you want them to do. Dangle a breakfast sandwich in front of me one more time and I might karate chop you in the throat.

3) The mental stress of ""not hitting your number.""

""It's all mental!!"" Listen, it's sales I get it. People miss numbers. But, when a widespread amount of people are just not hitting the mark there's a larger issue there. I've seen people in tears because of the frustration of this position. 100+ calls made every day, in a week, to reach hardly anyone, make no money, and get no further to any type of ""commission"" (I'll get to that in a moment) will eventually get to you. If you are ANYONE with somewhat significant sales experience I would say to avoid this place like the plague.

4) You don't get to build genuine relationships with business owners

You just don't. You get enough information and chat just enough to make sure they are ""somewhat"" comfortable to sign up with you. Then you kick 'em to customer success and you don't interact with them until they turn off the program (which can happen literally a day later) and they are back in your pipeline, usually, 90 days later. What am I supposed to do with that champ? ""Hey how's it going know you signed up with me and I know I told you it was going to work, but it didn't so hey, WANT TO DO IT AGAIN??""

30k is the minimum you have to sell for Yelp before you even should be discussing commission with anyone.

But, wait, there's more...

EVERY MONTH you have to sell at least 12k before you even sniff a dime of commission. And even then it's pennies until you get way up the ladder.

Now remember, you're making 40k base. So not only are you making over 80+calls, talking to multiple accounts you just called two days ago who told you to shove it, eating ""yelp sandwiches"" every day (because they're free and you can't afford anything else), being fed line for line like a puppet in the hopes of making a sale, but, at the end of two weeks when you look at your bi-weekly pay check you find yourself asking ""that's it?? where's the rest??""

In conclusion, you know that guy in the movie ""Get Out"" that comes running out of the woods and hits a smooth right off the screen never to be seen again?

THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

RUN.","Free sandwiches and snacks don't pay our bills. In fact, if you paid more we wouldn't need free sandwiches. We could buy our own.

There’s opportunities for growth- but mostly just to do a different version of the same job. If you work hard and do well, you can make solid money despite low base salary. Benefits were also great despite pay being low for the market.","High school- yelp has tried to get rid of the college 2.0 stigma and in doing so, has made things worse. It is insanely structured and it is very clear that upper management does not trust their employees to act as responsible adults- they push this onto their managers to make sure they are on their AEs about EVERYTHING

Unhealthy environment- for managers, you’re never quite doing enough. They’ll have you breaking your back and spinning in circles if you’re not successful (aka over producing on revenue goals), whether that’s for a couple weeks or longer term, regardless of how hard you’re working. Retention is made your problem, regardless of factors outside your control.

Feedback- yelp prides itself in being a very open environment for giving and receiving feedback, but in reality, feedback for the company/product is not well received. Instead, you’ll be told that you’re not bought in and as a result your team isn’t.

Growth opportunity- while there is a clear and accessible upward path, it is extremely linear- so there is little opportunity to diversify your skill set","Look in the mirror- take feedback as much as you like to give it. If you started seeing feedback as an opportunity to get better instead of a threat/retention risk, the company would be in a much better position.

Reward and appreciate your people- when you have good, hard working people- help find different ways to make them successful. Instead of making them feel like a horrible person when their work isn’t adding up, find other opportunities for them- putting people back in their previous role after hardship in any other role is not the long term solution. Also, you need a better long term retention solution- very senior AEs and managers are leaving by the handful- regardless of title promotions, give your senior employees more creative salary incentives and leadership opportunities to keep them around",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

And right off the bat, I knew working in inside sales was gonna be a huge challenge for me .
If you like the type of job where you gotta sit on your butt all day to make 80 dials then go for it . But here are the cons that come with it .
- micromanaging is absolutely terrible here. And what I mean is they will constantly be on your back about how many hours you talked on the phone, how many dials you’ve made per hour, and how many people you’ve got to a computer. Etc etc. If you don’t meet their expectations then you will be put down a lot.
Some of my friends who made big revenue would still be put down if they didn’t meet their daily metrics. So expect to be watched at all times. One of my managers even complained about me going to the bathroom a lot. Little did she know that I’m a human being that drinks a lot of water that has needs. So expect to be treated like you’re back in middle school.
- Favoritism: I worked with 2 managers at my time with yelp. The first manager I had always played favorites. If you created revenue , then you will be on their good side. She cared about her income more than the growth of her reps. So my advice is that if you don’t vibe well with a manager, please go to another team immediately . Cause that way you can see if you dislike the job or the manager . (Turns out I just disliked the job) But Managers do take a toll on your experience here. So take that into consideration.
- Snitching: This goes for the second manager I got. I worked with her for 2 weeks . And I don’t have complaints about her management but I do have a complaint about her sharing my business with my whole team without my consent. I thought I left in good terms, but it came to my attention that she shared the reason I left to my whole team without my consent. I get that you have to address the situation but instead of stating MY personal reasons for leaving , you could’ve just said that I decided to part ways. Easy peasy. I’m currently working on putting a complaint about this. Cause it ain’t fair.
People always come and go here, it’s rare when you see someone working for more than a year here. So please please think twice before coming here , it’s not the best environment.","I know the head of Chicago takes Glassdoor reviews into consideration so here’s my advice to you. Watch who you hire as managers. Not everyone is meant to be a leader. People are hired to be managers way too quickly here. If they can produce revenue that’s awesome ! But it’s more important to produce motivation and actually know how to lead a team. At the end of the day it’s a sales job , it’s not fun , but having a really inexperienced manager makes the job worse. Also take their attitude into consideration. Some managers act like high schoolers and really do not deserve this job. Last but not least, being a Hispanic coming into to this organization, I was hugely disappointed in one thing besides management. There was not enough diversity in management when it came to language. I had a lot of calls in Spanish but had no help cause 99.9% of management in my floor were Caucasian.

Young co-workers (if that's your thing.) Most people in the office are under 30. The Senior Director/Head of Office is ~35ish.

On that note, the Chicago Head of Office is a great guy. He and the HR dept seem to care deeply about making Yelp a good work environment. Most of the other directors are great leaders and motivators as well.

Free beer, and free food. Makes it easy to save money.

Not a place where they fire you swiftly for missing quota a couple times. Everyone gets a pretty comfortable amount of wiggle room and support before they start talking about termination.

Quick sales cycles - when it works out. If you're comfortable accepting low transaction sizes (and super high output) for relatively quick deals, you'll be happy to hear that one-call closes are pretty common in Yelp sales.","The worst part is the useless and obnoxious managers. Yelp sales is the blind being led by the blind. Most sales managers at Yelp have under 2 years of sales experience before they're promoted, and it really shows. These people don't know how to deal with others, and they barely know how to sell. They act like high school teachers that impose stiff (and ever-changing) rules and pull sales reps into rooms to scream at them. It's easiest for Yelp sales managers to take a condescending, bad faith, authoritarian approach but it stunts the growth of their salespeople. The inexperience in management leads to massive incompetence, bad attitudes, frequently-moving 'goal posts', and ultimately HUGE turnover rates.

Out of my training class of ~60 people, about 45 of them quit before their 1 year mark. Probably half of them quit within the first 6 months. Every entry level cold-calling job is going to have a pretty high turnover rate, but Yelp's is insane.

Yelp has an unethical sales culture. You call random business owner's with Yelp pages, push them super hard to make time to talk to you, and push for a quick hard sell, all while exaggerating our product's potential, omitting facts, and in some cases straight up lying to them about the platform's effectiveness. All at the direction of your manager.

You're cold-calling to sell advertising. Don't be fooled by this being B2B sales. The conversations are reminiscent of a rando who calls you to sell insurance, ""help"" re-finance your student loans, or upgrade your cable subscription. None of these business owners want to buy ads. If they did they would have called us (or there's a way for them to easily sign up on the website). You have to 'generate a need' to coerce them to speak with you. It usually sounds like this: ""I know you're not interested and want to hang up on me, but how do you expect to pay back those loans you mentioned if you don't generate some new business? Give me 10 minutes of your time and I'll show you how...""

What makes Yelp somewhat unique is the awful standing they have in the eyes of their clients. No matter what way you look at it, it's usually better for prospective clients to advertise with other online pay-per-click or pay-per-lead websites. I won't go into details here, but most prospects who are in the market for online ads will (rightfully) look elsewhere. Also, a lot of the clients you call have been receiving weekly cold calls from Yelp for the last 5-10 years. Then they have to put up with a ""persistent"" sales rep that won't let them off the phone. We have a reputation among small business owners for being super annoying and have an ineffective product, with good reason.

And potential employers have heard of this reputation, too. I've been told ""oh you work at Yelp? Our culture isn't quite as... aggressive here."" Because of this perception, Yelp is even worse than your average cold calling job. Not many experienced salespeople would ever stoop to taking a job at Yelp, and most inexperienced hires find better jobs quickly.

Because of this rough lot, Yelp hires just about anyone with zero sales experience whatsoever to fill desks and replenish their offices amid mass departures. Many people at Yelp are fresh out of college and have no idea what they're getting themselves into. My advice to someone in that position - like I was when I started working here - is say no to their offer. I wasted a year and a half at this bummer of a job.","Keep hiring managers from outside the org. The best managers I ever came into contact with at Yelp were the older, more mature outside hires. And this is coming from someone under 26.

I know Yelp touts their upward mobility into management, but your employees - of all ages - would prefer a better work environment with better team leaders, less sleazy sales tactics, more emotional intelligence, and honestly just more sales experience.

Maybe you can't change Yelp's RASS business model (make a ton of calls, push super hard, and see what sticks), but you can hire experienced managers that don't make it feel like such a crap shoot.",2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

After the change in leadership at the top of the office, office wide manager meetings, which had been an enjoyable constant, became few and far between and most info was dispersed through the Yelp rumor mill.

Managers are told from the COO that they are ""the most important position at Yelp"" but it certainly does not feel that way.

There is no where to really go once you are a manager. The opportunity for advancement is extremely limited.

If it had not been for a specific leader that I worked with, I don't know that I would have lasted as long as I did in this role.","Needs to be better from the top down. I thank every leader I met in my time at Yelp because they all helped me in some way, but overall there is too much mixed messaging and too little support for managers.",3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

I have left the Pros largely unchanged because the benefits are truly amazing and that can't be overstated. I have made significant changes to the Cons, however, because working here will slowly but surely eat your soul. Without further ado, the pros:

- Excellent insurance (100% employer-paid BCBS PPO)
- Fully-stocked kitchen (free breakfast/lunch/snacks/etc)
- Free in-house barista
- $39k base salary
- Strict 8-hour days
- 2 months of training
- $60/mo wellness stipend
- Free beer some days
- Casual dress code
- If you genuinely try and are open to feedback, your job is basically guaranteed for 6 months, even if you never close a single deal","Despite the excellent benefits, working at Yelp will eventually destroy you. The entire environment is engineered to be highly stressful every moment of every day, while simultaneously gaslighting the reps and convincing them that this stressful environment is normal/standard/healthy. The atmosphere is so stressful and toxic that people regularly break down crying, throw up in the restrooms, or quit without a backup plan.

Yelp's sales strategy can be summarized as this: Lure in fresh college grads by promising them a hip young culture, then take advantage of their energy and ignorance of corporate life by working them so hard that they produce a decent bit of revenue before completely burning out and quitting.

Yelp is very quickly losing ground as the market leader because they almost entirely neglect their technology. Rather than acknowledge their shortcomings and working to improve them, Yelp just puts more pressure on its sales force. In fact, the entire sales organization is just a hierarchy of unending stress. Reps are under pressure from their managers for not doing well enough, and those managers are under pressure from their manager, who is under pressure from the head of the office, who is under pressure from HQ.

You will not grow at Yelp, either personally or professionally. Your job is to pick up the phone 80+ times per day and read a script. You do this 8 hours per day, 5 days a week, forever. You will not learn anything new, and you will have no energy outside of work for self-improvement. You will live and breathe Yelp.

You will be micromanaged into the ground. Managers are required to be on their feet all day long, pacing around to ensure you remain enthusiastic and stay 100% on-task. I once counted the number of times my manager paced around my desk in a day -- it was in the 90s. If you are even a minute late, your manager will pull you aside and tell you off. In addition to your 1-hour lunch, you have two 10-minute breaks per day (the legal minimum), and God help you if you are away from your desk for longer than that.

The ""team"" culture will be forced down your throat. Your team will have off-site excursions and you will be expected to attend, even though you will not be paid for this time. If your team is not performing to expectations, your manager will bring you into a room and essentially tell you that you need to do better, while providing no valuable feedback on how to do so. Whether or not your team is doing well, expect to have at least 2 team meetings per day.

Something you will learn very quickly is that due to the bad product and manipulative (and unchanging) sales tactics, Yelp is absolutely despised by nearly every small business in the US. Do not mention to any business you frequent that you work at Yelp -- it will not be a pleasant conversation for you.

In addition to all of the above, the clapping, gongs, and bad techno music blasting through the speakers will ensure that you are stressed out of your mind for 8 hours a day. This stress will grow and fester over the weeks and months until you are an empty shell of a human being. But they won't fire you. Oh no, they'll keep you around for months, subjecting you to the same monumental stress and wearing away at your psyche while making you believe this is all normal.

For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE avoid working here. Yelp will absolutely destroy you.","Change up the coffee roast – the coffee we have now if a light-bodied, high-acidity roast. Try for something will more body and less acidity. Maybe a dark roast.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

2) Free Food! (coffee, breakfast, lunch, snacks)
3) Great people/diverse workforce -- people generally become friends
4) Supportive nature between employees, directors, managers
5) Invest A LOT in to teaching/training you
6) Opportunity to go from 0 or little sales experience to becoming well trained in sales techniques, learn how to handle/face objections, build more confidence in selling, etc.
7) Helps you have some experience to show when applying for other jobs you weren't qualified for before

*Before you apply, know that this is 100% cold calling. It's ""inbound"" sales because the businesses you call already has a Yelp page. But it feels like outbound. Yelp faces the difficulty of keeping employees long term based on that fact alone -- and they know that-- that's why they try to support you a lot professionally/emotionally and understand this isn't a place you'll likely be more than a few years, unless you're in senior roles.","1) High turn over --Many good people leave early in the job.
2) Cold calling all day
3) Fast burn out due to demands of daily metrics
4) Negative relationships between sales people and business owners
5) Most businesses hate/dislike/are very skeptical about Yelp. No matter how hard you try to be positive or help them, the negativity persists due to the nature of the Yelp platform.
5) Don't expect to make commission within the first 6+ months on the job (or even beyond then), unless you're the small percentage that's really good at hitting your number (most people around me didn't make commission).

***On that note, don't believe what recruiters tell you about the money reps make. Maybe some make a lot of money, but be realistic with yourself. Don't take this job if you believe the big bucks will come right away from commission. You can be extremely hard working and not even get close to it.

Ultimately, Yelp has the potential to be a place where there is less turn over and greater job satisfaction. The perks (listed as pros above) can only sustain someone's enjoyment of the company for so long. I truly wanted to love working at Yelp, I wanted to see the career advancement I envisioned. I'll give credit to the fact that Yelp has given me experience to be more qualified for other roles going forward. However, while I wish I wanted to stay longer, I was completely unhappy with the work I had to do every day -- as you're basically throwing yourself in to a gauntlet of rejection, objections, and very unhappy opinions about yelp from business owners.

The unhappiness comes from the fact that the majority of conversations with business owners you have are very unpleasant. Cold calling is already hard enough. But Yelp is especially personal to businesses. Most businesses are very unhappy with the review software that Yelp has. While I understand Yelp's intention with the software, and think ultimately the intention of it is good (especially for consumers) there is so much ambiguousness to it and misunderstanding that it's SO SO difficult to have a productive conversation with business owners about it.

Though they try, I do not think Yelp equips their employees with enough preparation to handle these conversations well. This isn't something an employee or engineer or manager can fix. It comes from the top down.","I'm not sure what efforts you're currently doing to market and communicate with business owners about the review software/platform. I'm sure there's a lot of effort and work already going in to it. But, ultimately, because of the misunderstandings and frustrations about the review software, there is a domino effect that seriously impacts all of the relationships of people within Yelp and outside of it. If, somehow, business owners could have a better understanding of the review software, and how to handle reviews themselves, maybe Yelp would sign up more advertisers or keep more sales representatives. I understand maintaining the privacy of the engineering of the software, of course you don't want people taking advantage of the system. However, currently it feels as though the review software has created a very hostile, unproductive, and combative relationship between sales reps and business owners. This isn not something a sales rep can fix/improve. There needs to be more explanation and support to business owners. More satisfied business owners with their free yelp page and review system will = more productive conversations with sales reps, which will = less turn over and more job satisfaction, which will then = more sales, revenue, etc.

I know it's more complicated than that, but something has to change.

Other side tip: Have more educational meetings/trainings between the sales reps and client support. I think it would help sales reps to see how client support helps businesses and understand that relationship more.",3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

Territories are extremely overworked with multiple touch points every week for years. I feel some biz owners have ptsd or something because when you mention yelp on the phone they have an immediate gut reaction to get off the phone as fast as possible. If your not hyper assertive and go don’t around the objection triangle 3-5 times on every call to get a biz owner to yelp.com you won’t get anywhere and attempting to do this 80 times a day, 5 days out of the week, month after month, you get burnt out quick.

Also if you have a bad territory prepare for months of not hitting quota. I had a territory where a full comp deal was as much as someone’s mortgage or I’d be calling into a small town in the Midwest an hour away from any big city. Conversely, if your manager likes you and you get lucky enough to get a territory in an affluent, highly populated area then deals come easy. I’ve witnessed this first hand.

Commission structure is pretty much a scam. You get judged based on your retention rate and if it falls below a certain threshold they claw back the commission. There is no term commitment with the ad program so most all biz owners stop after month because the product rarely works and you have no control over that. 90 percent of all commission I made at yelp ended up getting clawed back.

You'll be impressed by the kegs, or the bagels that you'll later realize taste like cardboard, or perhaps you'll see the basketball net and feel like home. Soon after training, you'll realize the honeymoon period is over. The cold calls never end. Eventually, you'll feel just as bad for the people that you're calling. You don't want to call them as much as they want to stop hearing from Yelp. It's harassment. Managers preach that it's ok to call the same local business 3+ times a day as long as you leave an hour gap in between. After working there for over a year and a half I started to see what the failed product was doing to small-town families. You're given skewed studies to sell to. Quantcast? wtf is that? Nielsen? they only sampled 2,500 business. Management started to realize sales employees we're catching on and becoming unmotivated, while at the same time it was becoming harder to trick potential clients. To give consumers less information and a false sense of hope express checkout was born. It was preached from higher-ups in management meetings including from the lead guy himself, Pdiddy, to SELL SELL SELL as much as possible and to worry about payment and retention problems in 3 months once the quarter ended. Expectations grew and commission checks tanked. Employees started to take their skills elsewhere. My favorite monthly roundup was when C level executives essentially begged employees not to leave for no-name companies. Seniority went out the window and Yelp became a free for all. Recent college grads are being promoted to management in 6 months and then demoted for lack of management training. Managers are known to haze reps by ""accidentally"" G chatting them about how they can't close deals, their appearance, or how they're wanted off the team. The lack of qualified managers for such a large company is astonishing. Not only that, but the director choice is another to be looked at. Sexual harassment, cheating scandals, and inappropriate behavior is just the beginning. This company has also financially extended itself far beyond its means. If you're a current employee with talent then I suggest you get out fast. If you're just making dials to get a paycheck, then I hope you get bought out by Google soon.

Now the job is cold calling HOWEVER, it's how they approach cold calling. At exactly 8:30 you need to be at your desk ready to go. At exactly 12:00 everyone takes lunch (HR says you can take it anywhere between 11-2 but good luck trying to tell your manager that). They have no flex when it comes to a sales cycle. If it's the day before Christmas or the day before Memorial Day weekend they expect the same despite the obvious fact that sales globally decrease. Your managers get on your calls and feed you line for line what you should be saying. Essentially you are a puppet to your manager. They push you to say uncomfortable things and start yelling on the headsets. It takes zero skill. No matter how much you do in a day/month/week/etc. it isn't enough and even when you do well, no one is happy there, they just can't tell you that. I know several people who have won the most esteemed awards at Yelp and all HAVE QUIT. You're forced to stand and your desk and ""bring the energy"" like we're 12 year old cheerleaders. The ""rewards"" they give you for closing deals is hilarious. Sometimes it's things like ""Pick out the cup"" or ""Bingo!"" Again, elementary school. There is also nowhere to go up. You can either cold call, manage people who cold call, do higher volume cold calling, or pray to get into Mid Market/National. The mission of your manager is to brainwash employees and use what they say against them. Why should managers stalking your emails and what is being said at work. Management known for being incredibly unprofessional, but there is NO DIVERSITY. Every single director is white. Every. Single. One. This is a company of 1200+ employees and you're telling me there isn't ONE you can promote? Managers are the same and they're all 23-25. They promote people into management extremely early and they are managers for training classes so you're forced to learn from someone who doesn't even know how to do their job. In addition, management is incredibly immature, power hungry and an overall mess. ALSO!! keep an eye on your managers and directors because they're sleeping with reps and doing obscene amounts of Adderall. Last time someone dropped from so much drugs ! Half of the people here are jumping around like bunnies!! ITS 8AM how TF! are you so wired!
Now the pay structure - Yelp went from contracts to non-term length commitment so the client can cancel anytime. You have no connection with your clients after you sign them up, and it's frowned upon to check in on them. Yelp pays you out as if they stayed signed on for 6 months so when they cancel (which they do because the product is outdated and doesn't actually work) you wind up owing the company back money. They tell you 20% of your sales needs to stay on for 3 months which seems easy but is not when they can stop and start at any time and you have no control.
Honestly, not the worst place to start for recent grads but check yourself and realize this is not a real job.","Stop with the lying, your are not here to help us.

The reality is that this person's team perform well, as do all teams in the LCP org because they get their share of the litter when it comes to talented sales reps. This has to be the reason that this manager is still in place. I was disgusted, shocked, and appalled by his daily behavior, so much so that I'm writing this review.

2019-02-08, Account Executive,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Great first job, that's about it..","Great first job, that's about it..",0,"People - Throughout my time at Yelp I created relationships with some of my closest friends, most supportive mentors, and peers that I enjoyed spending my days with. When I left, I was upset that I wouldn't be spending 40+ hours a week with them.

Perks - As a recent grad with limited income and time, a fully stocked kitchen was huge for me. Not having to worry much about groceries or buying lunch every day took stress off of me. Gym reimbursement, pre-tax commuter benefits, holiday party, etc. Pretty standard for a large corporate company.

Experience - This job is definitely a difficult one, but you will gain the necessary skills and experience to succeed in any role that follows. From my time at Yelp I learned great communication skills and how to deal with the common objections that sales professionals hear. I learned how to manage a pipeline and stay organized with hundreds of accounts at once. I learned how to interact with team members who come from different backgrounds. The job itself made my interviewing process post-Yelp very easy; I had tons of stories and examples to reference and other employers are familiar with what it takes to be an AE at Yelp.","The role - This job is 100% cold calling. Typically, I wouldn't classify this as a con, but the way Yelp's sales process is set up makes it a con. A typical day looks like this: 8:30am: in your seat ready to go. You are calling your accounts from 8:30am to 12:00pm straight through. from 12:00pm-1:00pm the entire office takes lunch (leading to crowded kitchens and shortage of food). Then from 1:00pm to 5:30pm you are calling more businesses. That is your day every single day; the job never changes. Occasionally, you'll have a 30 minute training covering topics you've heard a million times followed by everyone emphasizing the fact that you've been off the floor for 30 min so you need to step it up. The reality of this role is that you will be one rep out of 600-700 in your office, so unless you’re the top performer on your floor, no one will care about your input. When I was in this role, I truly felt what it was like to just be a “number” to an organization. AE’s at Yelp are so replaceable and they bring in at least 60 new college grads every month.

Leadership - In my opinion, this flows from the managers all the way up through the C-Suite. I used to always say that the leadership ""drank the Yelp Kool Aid"". Management will continuously set unrealistic expectations and goals and expect the reps to bust their butts to get there. Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% supportive of setting lofty goals and encouraging your team to hit them, but Yelp's leadership doesn't think logically. The reality of sales is that there are good days and there are bad days; there are also many outside factors that are not in your control. Management acts as if closing is so easy that if you ""want"" to close, you will and if you don’t close, it’s because you didn’t “want” it or had a bad mindset. I’ve had days where I pitch 3+ times and not close anything; not because I didn't do my job well, but because there were outside factors (timeline was off, didn't have the decision maker on the phone, the business just opened and they are in debt with startup costs, etc.) but your manager will ask you where you failed to show them the value of Yelp and how to fix it for the next pitch. Next, you will get e-mails throughout the day from your manager, your director, and even the head of the office, especially when the office is underperforming. Like I mentioned, days have their ups and their downs, but when your team/floor is not closing a lot, your performance will be publicly called “pathetic”, “unacceptable”, “disgusting”, etc. Again, the managers and directors think that closing is as easy as “wanting” it, when the reality is the stars need to align for a deal to come in. Managers and directors are only focused on revenue. I had times where I’d close and have questions about setting up a page, but since the revenue was already booked my manager wouldn’t spend time with me and teach me how to complete this task. Management is somewhat corrupt and there will be a story in the next section that highlights this.

Product - It’s very hard to sell a product that doesn’t work and that you do not believe in. The way advertising is set up is that Yelp charges business owners per click on their ad and clicks do not equate to revenue for these businesses. Throughout our pitch, although we never say the word “guarantee”, business owners are led to believe that paying a couple hundred dollars a month will lead to them gaining thousands of dollars in revenue. So, it’s very typical to see a client you signed up cancel within the first couple months. As an example, August 2018 was my BME (best month ever) and I closed almost $40k in revenue. Out of the 12 or so accounts I had closed that month, only one of them was still advertising in the beginning of October. I received calls, e-mails, and voicemails from these business owners stressing about how it didn’t work for them. Naturally, I couldn’t believe in the product anymore because these clients that had trusted me as an advisor didn’t find success with the program. From then on, I almost felt bad signing up the businesses that I closed. Even worse, here’s an example of the product and management not working as a whole. In the fall, Yelp gave out $300 credits to certain businesses to incentivize them into trying ads. I had account that had this promotion on the account. I called the owner, pitched him, explained how the credit works (the first $300 of your bill is covered by Yelp) and got ready to set up his page. When he logged in, the credit had disappeared so, while still on the phone with him, I asked my manager what we could do. My manager said that we can add the promotion manually through out Ops team so all I had to do was get his card on file (if he wanted to continue past the $300 period) and set up his page. We did that; we got the page set up and the ads were live. After I got off the phone I asked my manager to make sure that credit got applied to his account and my manager assured me that it would. Fast forward two months later; I check on the account in Salesforce and see that he has talked to our Customer Success team complaining that he was charged hundreds of dollars when he was supposed to have the credit. Customer Success told him that a credit was never added and there was nothing they could do. The business owner mentioned that he was going to take legal action and asked to be put on the Do Not Call list. How can I feel good about closing deals when stuff like this happens regularly?? Same thing happened to two of my teammates during my time there. On a separate note, Yelp’s review software freezes revenue right in its tracks. Because of business’s “losing” real, positive reviews I’d deal with people that refuse to pay for Yelp while this software is still in place. They’d literally say “I’d be willing to invest money into Yelp once the review software is fixed”. And to make it worse, as employees we were told nothing about how it worked. So when business owners ask or complain about it all I could say was “it’s a computer, it doesn’t have feelings. It’s out of our control, but what we can control is getting you new business” and then we just move past it as if the business owner doesn’t care about their reviews being hidden anymore. At the end of the day, Yelp ads only work well for certain industries in certain areas.

Process - Yelp’s sales process is very simple. Call businesses every other day for two weeks at time and close them as soon as possible. Even if they say “I’m not interested, thank you” you have to call them back in two days. Sometimes, if you get hung up on, your manager will make you call them right back. You will be micromanaged, your daily dials will be noted, your talk time will be examined, your quality conversations, etc. everything is heavily analyzed. Somehow it’s your fault if you are reaching a low amount of decision makers per day even with the right amount of dials. Does that make sense? Also, the commission structure is miserable. You need to book $30k in order to just be commission eligible, then you have to do a minimum of $12k to make any commission (at $12k your commission will be $100 before taxes). If your accounts cancel before 6 months, you will owe money back to the company. Anyways, if you’re out of your seat for more than 5 minutes your manager will ask where you were. If you are talking the person you sit next to, you will be told you need to focus. I’ve had team round ups where my manager says that we can’t take anymore breaks because the director noticed people out of their seat. 15 minutes later, I asked to go to the bathroom (which I shouldn’t have had to do) and got a “no” in response. The process has a big Time=Money attitude in the sense that every minute you spend off the floor or out of the office is revenue your team, your floor, your office, the company is missing out on. I think the process is flawed when only one or two reps out of 12 per team hit quota per month. If only less than a third of the reps are hitting their number that should tell leadership that there is a wholistic problem with the way the office operates. But at the end of the day, nothing will change. Leadership won’t change, the job won’t change, the product won’t change. I’d say 80% of employees leave within a year and by hiring 60, 70, 80+ reps each month, it makes up for the people who leave. The sad part is that top performers feel the same way. I sat next to the top performing rep on my floor and he vented to me every day and we both talked about where we were headed next. He was supposed to see a huge commission check after leading our floor in revenue, but he got none of it because he owed it all back to the company with his chargebacks. It’s sad because these fresh grads see the name Yelp as an opportunity to kick off their career but the reality is that it’s a dead end. The “promotion” options for AE’s are simply just calling different types of businesses (Mid-Market/National) or managing a team of AE’s that do the same exact thing you do every day. This plays a big role in why people don’t stay more than a year.","It's sad because no matter what I say here, nothing will change. I really do think some change within the offices could lead to success for Yelp. Yes, I'm biased but I've had so many conversations with fellow reps about what could be different and we all come to the same conclusions. So my advice to management is to listen to your employees and your customers. There are actually some very smart people there and their ideas can change the way people see and interact with Yelp. The only way to improve employee happiness, production, public reputation, and relationships with local businesses is to accept feedback and make changes. In November, Yelp stock plummeted and a huge investor wanted a new Board of Directors. Maybe once changes like that are made Yelp will become as reputable as it once was. Again, I don't expect Yelp to change anything with leadership, the process, or the product, but if by some crazy chance Yelp sees this I hope that they can accept the feedback and make the appropriate changes.

This is all not true.
When they tell you to be yourself, they mean who they want you to be. This entails kissing up to upper management, being corny and ""positive"" about the job a.k.a not batting at eyelid at anything that doesnt make sense or just plain lies or flaws in the system. By transparency, they mean you tell them everything you do wrong and everyone else does wrong but NEVER EVER doubt anything the company does because that means you are ""not being positive"" and ""not trusting the process.""

While the company is trying to grow up, they have also embraced a new stress on ""professionalism."" This is mostly because of all the Glassdoor reviews about how unprofessional management is. Instead of actually fixing internal issues and really looking in the mirror, upper (in office) managers have decided to take it upon themselves to be the ""professionalism"" police in minor things such as dress, etiquette and communication. While I agree this is all important, it is maybe 5% of what is meant when they are called unprofessional. It is mostly the micromanaging, the inconsistency and the fake aura around the entire office. However, since this is a lot harder to fix, they have decided to mirror in on the things that they can control (and further micromanage.) They value low performing managers that dress, talk and campaign upper management but also go flirt and hookup with their subordinates over managers who over perform but do not drink the kool aid.

When you try to relieve the mind-numbing boredom of the job, you are told to “stay focused” and “be efficient.” Which brings me to my next point: micromanagement is oppressive to the point of insanity and misery among representatives. Having your manager (most likely someone a year older than you, with little to no actual management skills) breathe down your neck constantly is annoying at best and torture at worst. Just because someone is good at sales, doesn’t make them professional or competent enough to manage a group of young professionals. Inconsistency is key at Yelp’s Leadership Development Program!
Base pay for NYC is impossible to live off of, with considerable commission paychecks only available to top performers. If you are considered “average,” it’s not a consistent and feasable source of income.

Also, free food and great benefits.","Those lovely people that you meet WILL be gone. Most don’t last five months and those that do are left in the dust and treated with little respect. The sales process has become little more than dressed up telemarketing. There is no longer any courtship with clients, they are expected to put out on the first date, 20 minutes after your first time talking to them (be prepared to have several meetings if you fail to do so). The expectation is 80 dials and 2 hours of talk-time a day, which is absolutely absurd.

Having a young workforce also means that unprofessionalism runs rampant. Everything from questioning an employee’s mental health to being essentially gaslighted on what the job entails on a regular basis, there is no sense of professionalism from anyone in the office. And, no, that doesn’t mean having a dress code (within reason, of course). It means treating employees with respect and dignity and not just having yelling matches from the bottom down. In my time of employment, I had three directors (two of which were fired) and six managers (four of which were demoted). Is that setting an employee or the company up for success on any fundamental level? Of course not. And having the gall to have the office open in the face of incredibly dangerous weather conditions when the rest of the city is shut down is just a shameful, shameful thing.","Take a deep breath and really ask yourself, why are you there? If you are excelling at that job and have been in a managerial role there, why are you still there? Is it getting underpaid? Is it constantly getting yelled at from the higher ups at the first sign of a bumpy month? Is it working hours and hours of unpaid time out of the office to keep up with all of the charts and e-mails? Is it getting to pie your boss in the face of plummeting stock prices and negative press about how the product doesn’t work and the company’s leadership is impotent and ineffective at the highest levels?

Not only are employees talked down to by management (clearly due to pressure from directors), but it is clear that the company does not value it’s employees. With the weather dropping to all time lows (-55 with the wind chill) in Chicago over the next two days, it is life threatening to be outside. Through multiple emails and meetings, it was made clear that attendance at work should only be hindered if it is impossible due to transportation. I am appalled to work for a company that has so little regard for the safety of its employees and clearly is prioritizing revenue production before we close out the month. While I understand the company and all of its employees still have a job to get done, the messaging today has made it clear that this company does not care about us anymore. This used to be a company I was proud to work at and refer friends to, but this type of disregard for employees has become a common theme within the office, with today being only one example.",This advice is less for direct managers than it is for higher ups.

- Yelp does not neglect employee's mental and emotional wellbeing; they are transparent in the demands of the job and management is always open and willing to talk to you about how you are doing and what they can do to support you -- with zero judgment.

- The company does not have ""values"" because all companies are expected to have them. Yelp's values are not textbook, they are meaningful and pertinent and are not just for the company and employees but the community as well. What's more impressive? Yelp manages to hire employees who naturally embody them.

- The only way you will fail is if you MAKE yourself fail. The managers are paid to literally help you succeed. All day long. If you show up and are eager to learn and implement feedback, you will succeed and grow.

- On that note, the potential to grow is limitless. They encourage you from day one -- you can go wherever you want in Yelp with hard work and. If you express a desire to reach a certain position, they will help you take the steps to get there.

- When there are times of stress, the office environment is alive and electric. Everyone is at 100% and cheering each other on. You will almost always find, there are No Bad Days at Yelp.

- I think the training program prepared us pretty damn well to roll out to the floor and what we didn't take away from it our managers and fellow team members keep us afloat and help us learn and improve every day.

- 100% employer paid benefits and the health insurance plans are very good.

- Generous PTO.

- Casual dress code.

- Stocked kitchens.","- Only 4 days for sick time then you have to use PTO. Many people get sick multiple times a year and need more than 4 days to recover. I have had team members come to work incredibly ill and they can't do their job properly, get others sick, and end up going home early, biting into their PTO.

- You need a doctor's/professional's note for ergonomic tools -- lumbar support, ergonomic mouse/keyboard, standing desk, inflatable ball, footrest. Sitting all day long in a standard chair is terrible for the human body

Since Tom and CJ took over this has become a toxic sorority call center. The department has been hyper compartmentalized and your job description has become limited to essentially a few tasks.

90-95% of your work is tell businesses essentially 3 things.

1. No refunds and why
2. We can't put back your reviews, our software found they were unhelpful
3. I'll help you cancel

The other 5%
1. Arguing with businesses to pay their outstanding balances
2. Update Yelp listings

It doesn't matter how long you work here, your skill sets will not advance unless you move into management or a different department completely. Someone who has been there for 6 months is essentially as good as someone with 5 years on the job. If you get lucky and get promoted into multi-loc, okay you will work on larger accounts but the overall skillset isn't different.

If you try and get a job somewhere else, the experience you learn at Yelp isn't as valuable as most people there like to think it is. Other employers will either turn you down immediately because of the reputation Yelp has with most other businesses or if you get the interview and they ask you about account management or marketing skills, you're gonna laughed out of the room. You are NOT an account manager. They changed the title to Customer Success Manager, because 1 you can pay your employees less and two because you are essentially a call center customer service agent. It is what it is, and they've proudly announced they are the ""Call Center For The American Dream"". Try not to throw up when you hear that.

My advice, if you take this job learn real marketing/project management/technical skills outside your work hours (project management, SEO, google analytics, excel, tableau, SFDC admin). They won't teach you... if you don't do this, and you're not part of their sorority, you'll be one of those employees just collecting a check and ultimately doing your career a disservice. At the invidable point where you realize this is huge waste of your time, and you try to get out and find a ""professional"" job, you'll need real skills, ones they don't teach you here.","If they don't like you, you will get boxed into one role with no opportunity for advancement . Even if you are doing side projects, mentoring others and building a strong brand on the floor, they will tell you you are meeting expectations. Which is essentially at 4-5% raise. It's happened to many people, myself included. I can't say this enough, senior leadership is a sorority. It's either they like you or they don't. If they don't... you're screwed.

Give clear path to getting a promotion. Do X,Y,Z and you'll be able to advance your career. In sales, they have that in place. In Customer Success, it's a joke. There is a KPI system they use to rank performance but there is ZERO transparency into what they factor in and the weights of each. Essentially the mindset is work extremely hard in all aspects of the jobs and we'll decide your worth (if we like you).",1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

You start with a ""class"" similar to high school or college so it's easy to make friends, but a lot of your friends will quit so don’t get too close","Much of your day to day experience will be mediated by your manager. Some managers won’t mind if you’re a few minutes late, ease into your day with breakfast, and won’t hassle you every hour for metrics. Other managers will reprimand you for being 2 minutes late, question your competence if you look away from your computer, and take you on frequent “walks” where they give you feedback on being as productive as possible. The positive people will say Yelp has a “hands on” approach to management, and the negative ones call it “micromanagement”. Both are valid depending on your manager. I’d say the management style for me is a con overall because if you aren’t consistently closing revenue, then you are hounded for your metrics. Territories do matter. New York City is not Greensburg Pennsylvania...

The biggest con for me would be the actual work itself, which is what you are doing for a majority of the day. On top of their relentlessly aggressive approach to calling where every conflict is seen as an objection, business owners tell me all the time how they feel harassed, manipulated, ect. The company is extremely transparent from the beginning that calling 80 businesses a day is hard work, but that doesn’t change the fact that the work is dull, repetitive, and by nature uninspiring. Everyone knows this, so there is crappy pop music playing at all times to keep energy up. There are constant, creative ways of keeping said energy up at all times – games, incentives, bonuses, food, PTO ect. Critical thinking and silence are mistaken by managers as disengagement and low energy. One of my managers literally told our team to “think less and do more”. To be fair, I’m a naturally calm person, so if you consider yourself to be quiet, introverted, or of the thinking type you will be constantly criticized (I mean given feedback). Everyday looks exactly the same, which sometimes is actually a great thing. A structured daily schedule allows you to be more productive and consistent in other parts of life. Also as a side note, one of Yelp’s core values is to be UNBORING; and I swear I’m the only one bothered that UNBORING is not a word.

All the intellectual barrenness is filled with a very UNBORING frat culture. Competition is encouraged over collaboration. In training we are told to always work harder than the person sitting next to us. Frequent happy hours. If you are historically insecure, sad, introverted, or mentally unstable in any way then I’d not recommend unless you are dedicated to self improvement.",Replace the starbursts with Avocados.,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,2.0

I shouldn't be hearing from one manager that ""I should look forward to being hung up on because it means I was pushing harder"", and then hear that's the wrong way go about this role from the company's own office head.
Yelp needs to do a better job of holding their 24 year old sales managers accountable to how they go about being ""leaders"" for their team. Lots of management use methods that have 0 integrity when selling to clients, (like allowing reps to play the ""buy or die"" clip from the Wolf of Wall Street as motivation when they were specifically told that clip is banned in meetings) leading to the increasingly hostile and combative conversations had every day. Lots of reps are constantly feeling less and less supported and valued as employees in the company and it's only giving them higher turnover.
Don't even get me started on the machine like output expectations that are required of employees every day: 80 cold calls MINIMUM, 40 emails 2.5 hours of talk time every day, and if all three of those are not met on the daily, its like you didn't do your job.

-Micromanagement to the extreme - if you are 1 minute (yes literally one minute) late expect to have a meeting with your manager. I guess they haven’t figured out yet that having multiple meetings with reps everyday about nonsensical things like this and leaving your desk takes up more time and is less productive.
-Another example of Micromanagement- your manager will literally make an Excel spreadsheet of all the times you’ve been 1 minute or late (including sick leave) and present it to you. Unreal.
-Pretty much like a middle school (I would say high school or college like but I actually had more freedom then than at Yelp) - examples - your bathroom breaks will be monitored, you are not allowed to leave the office and let’s say walk to Starbucks and grab a coffee (pretty much chained to desk), if you are hungry or thirsty (like a normal human) and get up to get water expect to get reprimanded like a child.
-Manager breathes down your neck every second of every day hovering over you, Yelp says this is “hands on training” but it’s so they can make sure you don’t look away from your computer for a single second (treated like a robot).
-Heavy sweatshop like vibes - forced standing for long periods during “power hours”, managers yelling (yes literally yelling) demands and saying things like “you will never make more than 40k” to degrade and humiliate you into “working harder”
-you can’t make commission until you hit $30k then another $12k a month after that. You could make $150k your first year in sales and still see $0 commission.
-Salary across the board is capped at $55k. I made more than that as a bartender.",Don’t retaliate against employees when they quit. And HR don’t retaliate against employees by emailing them a list of “expectations” (demands) if that want to give their 2 weeks as if your doing employees a favor by “allowing” them to work their last two weeks.

-You will be favored if you can hit quota and target consistently (duh, it's sales). Basically you can come in late with no repercussions, you can take as many breaks as you want, and you don't have to hit the dial quota every day. Oh! You will also be able to skip out on meetings.
-The ""managers"" are most likely a couple years older than you (if you're out of college). That basically means they don't actually know how to lead a team - they just know how to close deals. If you're expecting a more mature individual well..you're out of luck for this job.
-If you are not closing they will have a million meetings with you or sit next to your desk all day to micro manage
-Speaking of micro-managing, managers have access to your talk time, dials, and how many people you reached for the day. They will pull you aside or else Gchat you till you let them know it's all your fault.

While I had a great deal of outside sales experience when I started at Yelp, I had no real inside sales experience. I started at Yelp Chicago towards the tail end of 2015 and had no intentions of staying long. 60 days in which is how long the Yelp Sales Training Program lasts, I knew I was going to be here for a while!

Being a part of such a hyper growth sales company that grew from 150-800+ employees in the 2.5 yrs I was there is an unreal learning experience. I was fortunate enough to have done quite well for myself during my tenure and was given many opportunities to move into different roles and positions in the company. I also was able to experience multiple Yelp offices.

Chicago was definitely a very different culture than the other offices, and certainly had it's times of turmoil that come with hyper-growth sales organizations; ie, lack of experience at the management level.

When the new head of office came in, he certainly had a challenge on his hands to turn the organization around, and he, like the gentle giant grabbed the we' folk and shook the place upside down. The effort and visible leadership he displayed was something I'd never seen before. Sitting down with him, he told me it'd take a while to get the office where he wanted it to be and sure enough overtime those changes began to take place.

Overall, the Yelp culture is 2nd to none. The people and relationships I created were and still are amazing.

I will admit you can learn solid skills here and make decent money.","- High Turnover
- Inexperienced Management
- Boys Club Atmosphere
- Awkward Social Pressures Around Overtime

Yelp has quite a few problems, most concerning is retention. The company seems to have it in its mind that burn and churn is the best practice for current employees and seem to not mind if you leave because they will just replace you. The highs can be fun but are usually brought back down to reality when you realize your manager is a 22 year old college grad who has no life skills or experience other than the fact that they showed up at Yelp and shook the right hands and never questioned anything in their career to get promoted. Then unfortunately those people go on to become directors and when the going gets tough a strong manager needs to question things to get the right results and get their team back on track which is all but lost in this management circle of brown nosing yes-men. With all that said there is also the inevitability of the end of the month and maintaining your sales quota, and with this comes the awkward social pressure of repeatedly saying in meetings that all overtime must be approved by a manager first but if you leave early your not a team player so most people end up working without approval (which they rarely give) because they are pressured into it and not getting paid their worth.

If you want to move","Every few months territories get smaller, we lose a perk here and another perk there and it all ads up to feeling insanely under appreciated. Please put yourself in these shoes and have your job be harder every month for years, then be given less opportunity to make the money you were and be told ""just dial more"". It's quite an odd phenomena, but like try making less money yourself and having your job just get harder because were too concerned with overhead and appeasing wall street then to cap it all off your only consolation is to just hear well you could make up for it if you just work harder. Year over year, month over month, there has been nothing exciting that's happened for employees here and nothing to better employees either.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

- great insurance","- intense and aggressive open calls and pitches to business owners really made me and my friends feel bad. management would say that the business owner would either sign up or the bridge would be completely burned. If they didn't sign up and 'the bridge was burned' you'd still end of calling them 4 weeks later. bad business practice
- it really feels like you're in school. Work starts and ends at the same time everyday, for everyone. Everyone has to take lunch at the same time (12-1pm). There's no flexibility in this sense at all.
- in training they say there are a ton of opp. for growth but that's not true. Unless you're looking for a sales role, you're not going to get anything else here.
- needless to say, retention rate is terrible. People come and go so fast that the longer you stay, the less and less people you know and you end up feeling like there's no point in getting to know other people because they're probably going to be gone in a few months. When you tell people how long you've been here, some are baffled to hear you made it to a year, that's how bad retention is.

2018-10-15, Account Executive,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,This Job is Worse Than You Could Ever Imagine.,This Job is Worse Than You Could Ever Imagine.,0,There's only one positive about Yelp: Great Health Insurance! Of course it's easy to offer health insurance at zero premium when 95% of your workforce is under 24 yrs old with a college degree. So we shouldn't give them too much credit for figuring that one out.,"Working at Yelp is literally a waking nightmare. You get to the office every single day at 8:30AM sharp. If you are there at 8:31AM you will get a phone call and a text from your manager asking where you are. If that's not the first time you were 1 minute late then you may even have a sit down with your ""director"" to go over why you were late and if everything is ok.

From there, you will sit in a chair and read the same exact script as the person next to you. Every person you can hear will be having the exact same conversation, all day long. If you get up from your seat, your manager will want to know why, where you are going, how long you are going for, etc.

From 8:30AM to 12PM all you will do is dial down the same exact list as the day before. Every single day you will get the same voicemails. You will get the same busy signals. But you have to keep calling the same numbers because your ""manager"" refuses to give you a new territory or acknowledge the fact that your territory has been burned to the ground.

Then 12PM hits, lunch time. Since Yelp doesn't pay ANYTHING close to a living wage in any major metropolitan city the majority of the company will pile into the cafeteria to eat wet single serving deli meats on a variety of wraps or you can choose the smallest side salad you've ever seen. There will also be snacks and sugary drinks. Whatever they could give you to distract you from the fact that this is by far the worst job in America.

Come 1PM you better be back at your desk. Every day. No excuses no exceptions. Lunch is over and you resume calling the very same 80-100 numbers you had been calling from the day before. These people already told you they aren't interested, however you have to call them, or you will get another meeting with your manager to explain why you aren't making any calls. This will continue to 5:30PM. Then you can go home.

Underneath this unbelievable sweatshop of horrors, you will see no less than 10 people crying in a given week. I've never seen so many employees crying at work. Not because the job is so challenging, but because you are told to swindle hard working business owners out of their credit card, and if you don't keep literally yelling at a business owner to give you his credit card or to pull their car over (yes your manager will actually yell at you for not telling a business owner to pull their car over) you need to have ANOTHER meeting with your manager to discuss your bad attitude, or bad body language, or who knows what else.

This nightmare will continue on 5 days a week, until Friday. Then on Sunday, you will be faced with the worst anxiety of your life, because you can't believe that you are going to have to spend the next 5 days literally chained to your desk where you will have all of the same discussions as the 5 days prior all over again.

I remember telling my parents that I would have more pride in my work if I was a garbage man than I have working at Yelp. If you want to leave and find a new job you will need to come up with COUNTLESS ways to lie to your manager as to why you will be late. Why you will be off. They will ask you to your face if you are interviewing for other jobs. They will pressure you. And the best day of your life will be the day you QUIT and never have to go back to that sweatshop ever again.","I would tell Yelp management to stop hiring 100 people a month and focus resources on the employees you have, but that is simply not possible. Since Yelp is a publicly traded company, they have to show revenue growth every quarter and every year. Since the majority of businesses don't make money spending on Yelp and cancel their Ads relatively quickly, they need to hire more and more sales reps to maintain their revenue numbers. And once they burn out a city, they have to open a new office (HELLO WASHINGTON DC!).

Now that you are in a new city you have a brand new pool of employees to draw from. Now you have a fresh base of potential hires where you can pay THEM barely more than unemployment pays and have them push your worthless advertising on more and more unsuspecting business owners. More offices you open, more employees you can hire, the more you can pretend to show wall street how much you are growing revenues.

My advice to management would be to sell this company to Google now before they finish eating your lunch and there's nothing left of value beyond 6000 poorly dressed underpaid college grads and transitioning adults who hate their job more than life itself.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

2018-10-19, Account Executive,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,A cog in the machine,A cog in the machine,0,Good brand name to have on your resume,"A cog in the machine: This is a sales factory where you're just a cog in the machine. They don't value people with opinions and people with opinions are forced out or leave exasperated. People are unceremoniously fired and those that leave are here one day, out the next. No acknowledgement of their achievements. While sales is the backbone of revenue in the company, it is operationally driven. In other words, it’s about how they can extract as much from employees while finding ways to pay them as little as possible. While they ra-ra-ra teamwork and pretend to care about you, the reality is they just don’t. They suck you dry and then find somebody else to suck dry. Burn and churn and huge amounts of turnover even at the highest levels of sales.

A crony culture: At all levels, it's a crony and nepotistic culture where it's more about who you know and how long you've been at Yelp, than your actual skill level or sales metrics. Furthermore, unqualified people are in positions of power and people that have failed are rewarded with promotions. In my tenure, people with no management experience or a track record of success have been promoted to the highest levels. Those that are brought in by people of influence or have existing relationships are allowed to break rules and underperform. In a bout of collective cognitive dissonance, those that fail are lauded and those that succeed are downplayed. In short, it’s who you know, now what you do.

Pay: Yelp, from top to bottom in the sales organization, pay is far below market rate. In order to get your OTE, you effectively have to perform at 200% to goal. There are no annual reviews and pay raises. If you come in at your base rate, that base rate stays indefinitely. They say that they don’t want people that are here for the money; they want people that are here for the “vision and mission”. This is very easy for a well paid leadership to say but in reality it’s all about how they can suck you dry and benefit from all your hard work.

Transactional: Even at the highest levels of sales, transactions are rewarded over revenue contributions. The National org is effectively a glorified call center.

Culture: Want blasting music all day? Temperatures lowered to increase productivity? This is what they do. They treat employees like gamblers in a casino. While the upbeat culture is great for a 22 year old, if you value a professional work environment, this place is not for you. Want a crappy white bread sandwich with Frenchy’s mustard and cheap cold cuts? Plenty of that for you here. Want a clean kitchen, go elsewhere. This is effectively a college dorm. Want boogers on the bathroom walls? Mustard scattered on the counters? Loud and unprofessional behavior? Come to Yelp.

At the tipping point: 90%+ of the work force is at the tipping point of losing it. It's highly stressful and success is an exception, not the rule. It recently drove one individual to bring a gun to work and threaten himself and co-workers. This is not a normal place and not normal things happen here.

Fun but concerning work environment: high energy and fun place, getting too lenient with interactions of coworkers and management, lots of lines being crossed, uncomfortable relationships that are neither acknowledged or addressed

Commission issues: expectation to have quality conversations but they force you to dial 80+ people everyday which is a huge contradiction, once you sign someone up to the program you are pressured to finish the conversation and go onto the next sales call, which results in not setting up the program successfully enough so they cancel. Canceling hinders the commission you receive and can ultimately result in you OWING Yelp money later down the line due to charge backs.

1. Commission- First and foremost the commission structure of this company is pitiful. When you start you must close $30,000k to be commission eligible. Once you are pass that point each month you must first close $12,000k, then you will receive commission. However, there are numerous upon numerous people DO NOT close that much in a month. On top on that the commission is taxed 53%.

2. Management- I can say there is only one director who has a general concern for each and every rep in there pit. The rest of the directors are condescending and trash talk about the reps in there ""neighborhood"" but also their own managers. In the beginning it is always said that they will support you no matter where are you in the org. On the other hand, as time goes on you will notice that the managers are selective and will only boost up those who they like, are closing, or anyone who had the luck of getting a good territory but does not realize it. Moreover, managers are immature and have never worked in any other sales org besides yelp.

3. Demographics- This has been brought up by several people at the org. Large majority of yelp is caucasian which discourages the minorities who work here. Former reps and present reps have told me about certain awkward and borderline racist interactions with others at this company. In my opinion no one should feel uncomfortable at the workplace, and it is embarrassing to know this happens all the time.

4. Territories- At the end of your training you are assigned a territory. You better hope you have a populated city or else you are indefinitely screwed. They will tell you it is randomly selected but your territory is dependent based off your interview. After training it is up to your director which territory they want to assign you. I still to this day work with people who never hit quota since they are calling into an area that simply does not use yelp. Yelp will not take no for an answer because you will be calling the same territory, depending on circumstances, for 10 months after training until you are assigned a new one. Those who are assigned good territories will tell others around them what they are doing wrong. Mind you these are people who are fresh out of college or never worked in sales(No I'm not joking).

5. Sales Tactics- Pushy, aggressive, whatever negative adjective you can think of, that is what this company consist of. You are forced to be aggressive on the phone. The point of each call with these businesses is to play off their fear and anger, not to have a general care for there concerns. When it comes down to it you are not discussing but in fact debating. You will be arguing with people all day who do not want to hear from you. Accounts you sign up will cancel in less than 4 months, the program that is offered is made to max out each month though we tell people it will not.",All I said does not matter.

I worked at Yelp for 1 total year (how I made it that far without losing my mind I have no idea). For being such a well known technology company, Yelp is borderline a scam when it comes to being employed there. They hire everyone and their mother because the turnover here is ridiculous. They can barely keep people in the role, except for that 1% that gets lucky with a great territory and gets ""promoted"" within less then a year on the job. The main reason why I finally decided to leave was because of the unethical sales tactics this company uses against business owners on the phone. I went 1 year putting my head down and ignoring it because that's exactly what they brainwash you to do. Yelp instills that they ""love local businesses"" and that all we are doing is helping local businesses grow. When in reality we are forcing an advertising program (that doesn't even work for most) down their throats because this company is as money hungry as it gets. My manager would frequently make me (and my other teammates) scream at business owners to pull over while driving and get their payment information in order to close a deal. Now that I'm finally moved on from this company I can fully appreciate how horrible it really is. I wanted to leave the job sooner but unfortunately they also make you feel incredibly awkward when trying to get time off (especially to interview).

If you are considering a job here in Sales, PLEASE do yourself a favor and think twice. If you are someone who enjoys immaturity in the workplace, unethical sales tactics, and straight up brainwashing 24/7, then by all means this is your place. If not, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. There are so many other amazing technology companies who appreciate their employees and develop a great, healthy sales environment.","The fact that you are promoting 24 year olds (with less then a year of sales/overall work experience) to manage 23 year olds right out of college is absolutely ridiculous.

Like minded people.,"Where to even start....first off the recruiters dont highlight the fact you are calling businesses that have been called FOR YEARS by Yelp. I am a very social person and still felt super uncomfortable calling these businesses who want nothing to do with you. The few times you do get someone willing to hear you out, your manager jumps on the call and just tells you everything to say to the point you can only hear them and you are just repeating someone elses words... for a human conversation...its not natural. I understand this is in effort to make you learn the methods from a seasoned rep but cmon people high sales $ does not equal a good manager and the whole pitch is so aggressive I felt like I was seriously just in the process of scamming people over listening to their genuine concerns. Overall I was ready to leave this experience not loving it but respecting Yelp until I tried to formally give my two week notice (luckily got a new and better job) and my manager literallly told me to go write a list of the pros and cons of this job and that one, so ""we could go over it together to make sure I was making the right choice""... that just took it over the edge. They really do treat you like children here...management kept telling me to stick it out and give it a fair shot like I wasn't an adult who knows their worth, they watch over your shoulder at your desk all the time and give you stern talks if you're running 10 minutes late or even had a bad day and couldnt hit 80 dials...seriously? To anyone praising them for the fact you get to actually leave at 5:30 its only because they are too cheap to pay for overtime and this isnt something you should praise .seriously people? They dont let you leave early or come in late or take lunch even at a different time...people call Yelp college 2.0 for a reason.",Your turnover is horrendous for a reason but instead of changing anything just keep it up cause why not! youre just going to replace everyone who left with a giant class every month anyways,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

2018-04-30, Account Executive/Sales Manager,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Perspective is Everything,Perspective is Everything,0,"If you're looking at Glassdoor to decide where to start or advanced your career - I hope you'll take the time to read about my experience at Yelp. I believe that my perspective is different than many you'll see here.

This review is not just about the Account Executive position because if you come to work at Yelp, it's not about the job you start with or the skills you start with. It's about the job you're willing to work for and the skills you push yourself to gain. I recently left Yelp after 3.5 years to pursue other interests but I'm so thankful for the company and the opportunities I was given - maybe my perspective will help you find the same.

Let's start with the most important part of working at Yelp - it's hard! I started right out of college in SF as an Account Executive in 2014. The job was exactly as described - tons of cold calling. In fact, the reality of sales is if you're not on the phone you're not advancing your career. Anyway - I digress. I was 6 months in and I hated it. In fact, you could probably look at some of the other glass door reviews and see exactly how I felt. But here's the thing - unlike many of the people I worked with. I decided to take the challenge head on and see what I could make of it.

I started focusing on what I could learn and let me tell you something. This job has more opportunities to learn pivotal skills than any entry level job I've come across. Your communication is pushed all the time, your ability to handle rejection and persevere is so key that it becomes second nature.

For the next 9 months I focused on skill building. I became great at building relationships. I was pushed to constantly improve and learn and become an expert in countless fields. I was pushed to apply for leadership programs and held to a high standard - one I became accustomed to hitting.

After 1.5 years I was promoted to management. The opportunity of a life-time in my eyes. I was able to grow a team of individuals I cared for deeply and we pushed each other to better ourselves all the time. I was able to learn public speaking skills, I learned how to read data like a professional and my sales skills were pushed to grow at all times.

After about a year - another opportunity came about and I moved to Chicago where I worked with some of the best people I've meet. The culture and the work environment are top notch. The leaders from the top down are amazing to work with - plus the Office Head has a British Accent - always a plus!

This job is about opportunity. Opportunity isn't easy but it's worth it. If you want to push yourself and become the best version of yourself - come work for Yelp and see what you're capable of.

My perspective is different because I looked at the ""negatives"" as learning opportunities. The paths towards career advancement, the compensation and benefits, and the workplace culture made this a no brainer for me. No job is perfect but my life is undeniably better for my time at Yelp!","This job is not for everyone. There are a ton of calls involved and the job isn't going to change.

You need to push yourself. You need to have a great attitude. You need to outwork your peers. You need to be intrinsically motivated. If you're all of these things - this jobs for you.

Lack of diversity is a concern but up against other Tech peers Yelp is no worse. I would have loved to see more initiatives for diversity at the management level but from my understanding leadership acknowledges this and is working to see it improved!",Always remember to believe in your people! It's what made me so successful at Yelp. So many of my managers believed in me I had no choice but to succeed.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

2018-08-08,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Not bad,Not bad,0,"Pretty laid back culture, easy to coast if that's your thing.

The organization is very inclusive. Above average number of non-male engineers, great support for parents, LGBT, women, etc. I really like it. This includes training for managers and people in leadership roles.

Engineers are empowered to improve systems. If you're a self starter, you'll do well here.

Tonnes of peer learning opportunities, particularly for young / inexperienced managers.

Enough scale to be interesting but enough money to force creativity :).

VPs are generally amazing human beings, especially Wing Yung and Sam Eaton, who are some of the nicest senior leadership I've had the opportunity of working with.","Yelp's benefits are okay but pretty meagre (outside of healthcare) compared to much of their competition. For example, their 401K match is $1,000 (although recently they increased it to $3,000 once you've been here over a year) - which pales in comparison to Google, Facebook and others.

Yelp also only offers 15 days of PTO per year which increases to 18 after 2 years and 20 after 4 years. This is pretty mediocre - Facebook offers a standard 21 and many other companies offer unlimited discretionary time off which is less burdensome (particularly since you don't need to accrue it before you can spend it).

Sick time is capped to 5 days a year. After this, if you don't have a nice manager, you start eating into your PTO. This means that people don't take sick time when they often should.

Their gym/wellness allowance is lower than many other tech companies.

No catered lunches aside from Hackathon (which happens 3 times a year). This forces you to go explore, which is fun but expensive - effectively missing a $3-5K perk that other tech companies offered. Plus, it's pretty inefficient to leave the office in search of food.

Yelp is very much a mature, stable company with a significant amount of tech debt and legacy code. This offers a lot of scope for improvement but also means that new features take longer to release than they might at a smaller, more nimble organization.

Very ""young"" engineering team. People have a lot of energy but this often results in people building new systems instead of adopting existing solutions that are standard in industry.

Related, there's no levelling structure and opportunities for career growth are pretty vague. Yes, you'll take on responsibility but short of getting the tech lead badge or becoming a manager, you'll be a software engineer forever.

A lot of the engineering tooling is fairly antiquated and you have to be on the VPN to do anything useful. It took months and months to get Slack after years of using IRC. We use ReviewBoard which just about does the job but could be replaced by many more modern alternatives.

I'm not seeing a lot of stock price growth, which makes compensation even less great.",Take a hard look at benefits - particularly PTO - and amend it to match the market. Offer some kind of career ladder.,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,5.0

- 0 flexibility in work day... You can't even work 30 minutes in your lunch to be able to leave 30 minutes early for a certain occasion (i.e. doctors appts, other jobs, etc.)
- Forcing people to stand up for power hours & telling them they're out of shape if they can't stand longer than 20 minutes... we're not farm animals :-)

Your manager plays a big role in your career here at yelp so if they are micromanaging you then that can stifle you or if they are giving you room to grow then you can definitely blossom. You will be required to be on the phone all day making cold calls so if that not something you see yourself doing it is not for you. If you love being on the phone and talking to people, learning about their business then you would love it here.

First the assigned territories are a big problem. If you get unlucky and call into an area where yelp isn’t as popular be prepared for months of struggling to hit quota. It is taboo to blame your territories but I’ve seen great sales people do bad when they have bad territories and very well when they have a good area. Territories aside, management expects you to be very aggressive on your phone calls, which leads to a lot of burned bridges. This normally isn’t a problem for me, but becomes a problem when you’ve burned a bridge with a business owner and are expected to call them back 2 days later. If you kick them out of your pipeline they’ll most likely come into your pipeline again 2-3 weeks later. Typical day consists of making 80 plus calls, and having about 50 unique calls which means you are constantly on the phones being pushy. Be prepared to be micromanaged as each and every call is tracked. You are judged on 3 minute calls, how many business owners you speak too, pitches, and of course how many dials you make. Management will try to make you believe that this is the best advertising product out there but every business that I have signed up has always cancelled after 2 months. On top of the terrible day to day of the job, the people you are calling are the worst. These are people who have been called non stop by yelp for years and years so I can’t really blame them for being rude on the phone. Yelp is looked as the villain of corporate America in the eyes of the business owners and unless you’re calling in Los Angeles or other popular area business owners won’t have any respect for your call. I would only reccomend this job to freshly college graduates that don’t have much office work experience. Stay for a year learn as much as you can and get out. Also pretty low starting salary.",Change your business practice. Over aggressive sales tactics is not going to work in the long run. Treat your employees like they matter and not just a number.
