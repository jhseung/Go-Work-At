Penny wise, pound foolish management:

o They have moved numerous employees across the street twice in twelve
months. After a couple of months in the new location they abandoned
one entire floor to sublease it, causing more disruption.

o Loss of autonomy as management forces angineers to use a round peg in square hole approach in their attempts to make everything uniform.

The company uses a facade of self-empowerment in the evaluation
process. Managers write ""goals"" for employees and have them
copy-paste the text into the Workday system as their own input.

Top level management is often uncertain on the best way to implement
their plans, and this makes them prone to using charlatans and petty
tyrants in low-level management positions.","Try to achieve real transparency in communications with employees. The

We have many amazing employees to work with who care about the customer and the product.
The company used to have a great culture and there were many opportunities to do new things in interesting ways. Some of the employees still can do innovative and interesting work, but it's now completely restrained to the research group and the new Boston team.
Pay and benefits are good and time-off is excellent. There is no 401k match but there is a 401k.
Work-life balance can be good when departments are staffed.
The culture retains a health and fitness focus that benefits everyone.","The current management team under the founders are poor leaders. From HR to Operations the leaders are out of alignment with one another, running their own fiefdoms. Leaders generally treat their employees and first and second level managers like pawns or cogs - irrelevant and unimportant. VP's, however, can do no wrong even when their departments are losing people in large numbers. Behavior is bizarrely hierarchical. You have to get VP approval to buy a pencil. You will not have much autonomy at Fitbit anymore. You won't even be able to work from home in many departments. You will not do innovative work. You will be asked to do things in outmoded ways often. You will also have much of your interesting work given to vendors or off-shored, bit-by-bit. You will still have lots of uninteresting work because your peers will continue to leave in droves (attrition is higher here than anywhere I have ever worked). You will be micromanaged in many departments. Your VP will take credit for all of your work (which is their right) and they will not share that credit or acknowledge you even in private (which is not their right). And the worst part is that you will keep hoping that things change and go back to the culture Fitbit had before January of 2017 and you will suffer for your loyalty.","My first word of advice is not to write a condescending reply to this review. It makes you look petty and proves my review correct. I would also advise that the founders look closely at the reality of what it's like to work at Fitbit - not at the VP level and not through the words of the HR department - but at the level where the work gets done. And, when you see that it isn't good, change it. Fire a senior VP every once in a while. Hold people responsible for attrition. Be open and honest about the plan to move jobs to Romania - tell us what work will go and what will stay in the US. If you want someone to stay, tell them and then don't turn around and lay them off. Produce a strategy you can articulate clearly and in less than 30 minutes. The new Boston team is great, protect them from the negativity of corporate. Do one thing every day that shows you value your employees (not your VPs) and then tell people what it was. It will work way better than doing one thing every day that shows you don't value us and then denying that it was done.",2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0

The managers are weak. And the team suffers for it. Their bosses are even weaker. Indicision kills momentum on a daily basis. Everyone is afraid to make a decision. You're rewarded if you talk a good game, even if you've provided no tangible results.

The VP plays favorites, so... Hope you're one of the three people to have worked with him in the past. Otherwise don't waste your time.

Well, this is neither of the above, so don't skim over this one.

Short version: if you are considering accepting an offer here -- don't. For your sake, accept the fact you got some decent interview experience here and use it to get an offer somewhere else.

Long version: Let me elaborate on a few examples of ""fun"" things that happened during my tenure at Fitbit:

- For about a month and a half I didn't receive a paycheck because they switched payroll providers and I was marked as ""terminated"" in the system.
- I watched my initial RSU grant get cut into about 1/8th of what it was after only about year of employment. You read that right folks, a consistent monthly decline for 12 straight months. The year after was just as bad.
- I was re-org'd 3 times - each time more confusing than the last.
- Lunches were taken away.
- All supplemental perks were reduced in some capacity or another.
- We were promised a company gym, and 401k match. Neither of which happened, surprise surprise.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg - here are the REAL goodies that should be showstoppers for you:

- Round of layoffs, plus a paraphrased inspirational quote for you: ""we are saving lives here, if you want to get paid fair wages, go work somewhere else"".
- Deadlines were unreasonably tight -- a consistent theme that you get numb to over time.
- Bonuses were sad at best, with veiled threats of taking them away completely if you can't work at 150% capacity.
- Resources were insanely mismanaged. Decades of backlog estimates.
- Company vision changed roughly once every 3 weeks or so. ""X"" is the future. Wait 3 weeks. ""Y"" is the future. Wait 3 weeks. ""Z"" is the future. Want to know what this means? It means the execs are throwing darts on a dartboard and hoping something sticks.
- Attrition levels are maddeningly high. I don't know the exact figures, but don't expect to work with your teammates for long here. Culture and morale is in the toilet.

The company had everything going for it, and has really floundered due to inexperienced and a really out-dated approach to building a company, executing on a vision and cultivating employee engagement, connection and loyalty.

- Cool to work on hardware products.
- Raw passion and compassion for colleagues at the lowest levels of the hierarchy.","Buckle up, buttercup.

- Lack of vision from top leadership on whether we want to be a health company or a consumer electronics company. This creates a fragmented and broken product portfolio. Latest smartwatch release is a prime example. It pales in comparison to almost any other smartwatch on the market, and though it is equipped some more advanced sensors, they are not functional on the product because the software work required wasn't completed.

- Numerous layers of completely inept middle management are given way too much power. The largest piece of this problem is the product management org, which needs to be completely gutted. The new trimester planning process is a turf war, consisting of weeks to months of bitter fighting to get features on the roadmap. We end up committing to doing too much, since NO ONE seems to do any resource planning to figure out whether we actually have the staff to build what the PM org and execs put on the roadmap. The actual dev and design teams who will be tasked with the work have little voice in this process and only find out the results at the end. Compounding all of these problems, the planning cycle takes so long and happens three times per year which means we're almost always in a planning cycle and continuously shifting around our priorities.

- Teams across the product development side of the house (sw and fw engineering, QA, design) are all understaffed. This leads to dismal team morale, constant tension between ICs in these teams, and very high attrition rates even by Silicon Valley standards. Some employees are so overworked that they come in even when sick because they have too much on their plates to take time off.

- Due to overcommitting and lack of resources, the scope and feature set of products we release are usually severely cut from the original plan for the product, to the point that the original vision for the product is barely recognizable in what is actually released.

- Major lack of diversity especially in management teams. Mostly white men. The company has no visible programs to foster diversity in hiring. There are some special interest programs once already inside, but they don't seem very active. Fitbit's answer to our diversity problem is ""we don't have one.""

- C-level leadership is not present and feels disconnected from the rank and file. Bi-weekly all hands meetings feel more like a mandatory address from a dictator than an open dialogue. I have worked at companies much larger than Fitbit, with *thousands* more employees on their HQ campuses, and still felt the executive leadership was more open and connected to staff. The CEO and CTO really should take a pause from whatever they do on a daily basis and take time to meet with a listen to all of the teams building out their products.

-- As a sub-item to this, there is a lack of transparent communication from the top down at Fitbit. Exec leaders yack all the time about how they are working to improve this, but little has changed. Prime example: earlier this summer, there were apparently some kind of violent threats made against our San Francisco HQ. The company sent out cryptic emails telling all of us to work from home and not come into the office, but leaving us otherwise in the dark. This came from HR, not even the C-level execs. This went on for several days, with nightly emails saying to ""keep working from home tomorrow."" After a week, they claimed they worked with law enforcement to confirm it was safe for us to return to the offices, but never shared exactly what the threats were or what steps were taken to keep all of us safe in the future. The entire situation was completely mishandled. Reminds me of our layoffs in Jan '17, but I'm sure there are enough Glassdoor reviews on those so I'll skip over that subject.

- There is no formal performance review process at Fitbit. There is only a self service check in web app that is fairly useless. Some departments have come up with their own performance review processes which are biased and opaque. Apparently I have had several performance reviews in my time at the company but no one has ever shared any of the results with me. When I surfaced this complaint to HR, they asked, ""have you ever had a conversation that seemed like it _could have been_ a performance review?"" *jaw drops*.

Given this lack of clear evaluation, promotions seem unfair and opaque, and many ICs and even team leads do way more than their job description but still don't get promoted. This increases our attrition problem. Some who have left have told me they were offered (long overdue) promotions on their way out, which just feels pathetic.

- Our entire marketing organization has a very poor understanding of our product portfolio and relies heavily on people in the product development side of the house to do their jobs for them. They have dozens of project managers, coordinators, and other oversight roles but not enough executors which means they outsource or try to force others to fill in on the execution.

- Archaic tools and lack of proper productivity technology and processes result in an insane amount of unruly emails, lost decisions, and lack of clarity across functions of the product development org. It is baffling to me how little this company invests in basic project management and team planning software. Our Jira structure is a giant mess with a huge part of the prod dev org sharing one single Jira project with tens of thousands of tickets (not at all how Jira is supposed to work). Different teams also use Jira in different ways which makes it even less effective. Our Wiki is a joke with thousands of unorganized, duplicate, and abandoned pages. This is such an easy problem to solve compared to all the others this company faces. Will someone WAKE UP and smell the roses already?!

- Lack of office perks including no food, poor snack choices which never change (and unhealthy ones at that).","- Stop trying to crank out hardware products without any regard for whether they have compelling market value or not. Spend more time thinking about and explaining your vision for the company to all of us, if there is one.

- Staff up teams in the prod dev org so that you have enough resources to build out your product roadmap, or cut down the roadmap. You are going to burn out your entire staff or literally drive us into the grave.

- Have lower level staff submit goals for middle tier management and work out a system for said management to be accountable to reaching those goals or at least attempting to solve problems in their org.

- Do a listening tour with all of the teams involved in the prod-dev process.

- Give us better collaboration and communication tools, and a few more heads to do knowledge management.

- Implement a better and more transparent performance review process, with safeguards to make sure staff are promoted appropriately when doing the responsibilities of higher roles, to prevent them from leaving to level up.",2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

2017-05-24, Research,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Avoid the Void,,0,"The Research team remains very friendly, comprised of smart people, and has great work-life balance (basically borderline irresponsibly lax work culture).

Recently the Research leadership has attempted to crack down on useless projects and finally acknowledged the widespread dissatisfaction with career develop as an actual problem.

Hiring is now happening again, mostly because lots of talent either got fired or left.","The biggest con, in both my own personal experience (largely validated from my conversation with colleagues), is the lack of leadership material from the Research management.

What makes a great leadership? Here were the top characteristics that were aggregated during a company wide survey of Facebook employees (a company with happy people) and my own experience of whether management met this.

1. Show and demonstrate interest in what is most important for EACH person’s work experience in the team?

Nope. Manager never approach me to ask me specifically what I wanted professionally or helped plan my career path.

2. Support people in finding opportunities to develop base on areas of strength and interest.

Nope. Although leadership knows what my strengths are, they do not care to find out what my interests are, let alone align my strengths with them. In fact I have to actively search for my own opportunities with no support.

3. Set CLEAR expectations for individuals and team

Nope. While we do have a goal setting system, it's viewed as overhead and not treated with much respect. Each team and manager engages with the system differently, yet we've come to find out that it was actually used to determine who got fired. Also people get promoted out of the blue with NO published/defined set of guidelines as to why they were chosen. If the leadership thinks they are making the right promotions, then why can't they have the guts to announce to the team what metrics they used to determine this? Answer: subjective and political

4. Give clear, actionable, feedback on a timely basis

How can you give feedback when are no set expectations of different levels with in the team? It continues to be an excuse for managers to shy away from giving real feedback.

5. Hold people and team accountable for impact

Yep. Not enough impact -> fired

6. Recognize people and teams for outstanding impact

My manager has only recognized me with ""good jobs"" about 1-3 times in my life.",Get audited by HR professionals. Isolate managers who need to be put into regular leadership training. Don't just make managers out of great technical people.,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

2017-04-09,,,Former Employee ,Leadership has lost its way.,,0,Attracts many fitness enthusiasts.,"This review is long overdue but necessary. I hope all the best for Fitbit, but the most recent executive leadership in HR was toxic. This executive HR leader illustrated that nepotism was ok by hiring her friend from a previous job who lives outside of the country. She allowed him to stay 2 weeks every month in SF sometimes bringing friends, sometimes family with him and then again by not laying him off in January when it was clear there was no value add brought to the team. Sadly, even the people in other senior HR roles didn't have a say in the matter even though they knew this was happening and saw that he was no longer an asset.

Furthermore, internally Fitbit is a real life example of the movie Office Space. If you're bad at your job and are lazy then you will get promoted. It doesn't matter how great of a job you do or how outstanding your track record is, working hard will get you nowhere in the company especially as it relates to HR. My only hope is that Fitbit finds a strong and honest executive HR leader who makes decisions that are focused on the company to instill trust back into the employees. This is no easy task, but for the sake of the customer base and employees this is vital to the company's ability to bounce back from the current state of affairs and turn things around.","Pay attention to the leaders you are hiring, single handedly they can change the culture of their department.",3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0

Fitbit has a great product and the leadership knows that they must continue to improve in order to stay on top of the market. The investment in engineering is impressive.

Fitbit brings San Francisco engineering culture to San Diego and that's refreshing.

Engineering managers all remain very technical and they continue to contribute to projects.

The engineering team is extremely supportive, trusting and demanding all at the same time.

Very flexible work hours to accommodate a healthy work/life balance. Afternoon walks/runs/workouts are extremely common.

Lack of trust in the experts Fitbit hires, leading to micro-management that then leads to waste and inefficiency.

Lack of planning and structure, and somewhat dismal distribution of responsibility.

2015-08-17,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,The best professional experience in my career,,0,"Fitbit makes culture a high priority so I think there are several things that stand out to me:
-This is the friendliest office I’ve ever worked in. Everyone smiles and says hello. Everyone will stop what they are doing to ask you how your weekend was (and actually listen).
All of the VPs and Execs sit with the other employees. No one is removed or has their own office or a “better space"". You wouldn’t even know someone was a VP until you look at their calendar.
-There is a lot of lateral and upward mobility. Fitbit really invests in all of its employees. It’s the type of place where you’re hired for you and all of your skills and personality. If a role opens that is a better fit for you, Fitbit wants you to be able to move around. If you’re not fitting with the role you currently have, it’s the type of place where managers will work with you to see where else you can focus to do your best work.
-There is an awesome work / life balance. People work really hard and they are excited about what they do, but no one gives you a hard time if you tell them you’re leaving at 4pm one day because you really want to spend time with your friend from out of town, or when you tell them you need an extra day because it’s been a long week and you need some time to relax. Everyone is excited to hear about what people are doing outside of work and understands that investing in that is important.
-Everyone loves the product – it’s really cool to be in a place where people actually use product that we are all working on every day. When the latest software or hardware or even color comes out, the office is buzzing with people who get the first edition to test out! it’s really exciting.","If you aren't a proactive person, it's possible to slip between the cracks here.
