2017-11-02,,,Current Employee ,Mission-driven Company,Mission-driven Company,0,It is so refreshing to work for a company with a mission and senior leadership who strengthens that mission. I feel supported by management and truly enjoy the work I’m doing and the work we’re doing as an organization.,"There will always be an adjustment period when you have new leadership, that's to be expected. However, it seems (based on some of the previous reviews) that new leadership was very much needed.","Continue leading the company with the mission in mind, relying on the talent of your team, and help us continue to flourish and succeed.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
2019-03-16, Administrative Assistant,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Pretty good company,Pretty good company,0,"It's possible that my perspective is skewed since I came to LP from a really horrible job, but I think for the most part that this is a great place to work.

The people are genuinely kind and want to see you succeed. The hours are fantastic and they are generous with PTO. There are a lot of meetings (sometimes a bit more than necessary) but they provide the space to trouble-shoot problems that arise.

I think the editorial department is really strong and people make an effort to talk to other departments and keep the lines of communication open.","I came to LP after a lot of management changes took place, so I can't speak to what it was like before, but you can definitely still feel some uncertainty around the office.

The new team of upper management is still learning how to work together and sometimes that stress can trickle down and affect employees, but it seems like they're aware of it and are trying to work through it.",Maybe have a suggestion box or a town hall so that grievances can be heard?,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0
2017-05-19,,,Current Employee ,Breath of Fresh Air,Breath of Fresh Air,0,"New president and senior leadership has recently been put in place and it’s already making a big difference.

2016-11-30,,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Run. :),Run. :),0,"I thought I'd check the reviews for my former company and it appears nothing has changed...maybe even gotten worse since I was there. For those considering positions at this company, please pay attention to the other reviews. Every single word people are saying is accurate (except for the one person that gave this company a decent rating).","Should you take a job here, do so because you need income and plan on immediately looking for something else. There's no shame in taking their money from them. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do.",Ha. Management needs a purge. That's all that needs to be said.

2016-10-03,,,Former Employee ,The definition of insanity is...,The definition of insanity is...,0,Sounds like the hours are still good.,"It's disappointing to read that this organization has not taken heed of valuable feedback from its employees.

2016-09-23,,,Former Employee ,The staff is so scared they'll be fired.,The staff is so scared they'll be fired.,0,"Hours. In the winter, around the holidays, you get about a week off, in addition to your own vacation time.","Lack of leadership (reactive instead of proactive; managers are not supportive of their staff, instead of helping, they will throw you under the bus to save themselves without any qualms, due to the palpable culture of fear).
I've worked at 2 international publishing companies, and I've never made books this way. Not collaborative in any way, staff barely spoke about the project to one another (met for 15 minutes once a week for status), and the content was determined by the manager and the managers manager, even though editors were held accountable for said content. Very backwards way of doing things and managing staff.
When you give no direction or training on how a company does things, I don't understand why you'd blame the employee for not knowing or asking.","Get additional managers in editorial - they've lost 3 very good, experienced editors in the last year, due to the manager. Since there is only one manager, editors feel there is no option but to leave.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0

2015-08-24,,,Current Employee ,Wonderful Work Culture,Wonderful Work Culture,0,"Great work/life balance. There is a focus on quality so you are provided with the resources and ample production schedule needed to accomplish your goals. Unlike the general trend in the publishing industry, most tasks are still in-house so editorial, production, marketing, sales can all easily communicate and problem solve. Opportunities for professional development. Strong, collaborative office culture; great coworkers.","While the environment is generally collaborative, once some members of upper management set a project's procedures/goals/policies they are set... until they are not. Management can at times keep making adjustments to details until the last minute and you are expected to just ""deal with it"", which can make like very stressful if you want to do quality work. However, if you see these problems coming ahead of time, they don't always want to hear it. Some there ""just know best"" even if they don't. Every place has such complaints and this isn't extreme... just annoying at times. Also, there is a yearly 3% cost of living increase, but few opportunities for real pay raises unless you get a promotion, which is rare.","Be more open to the suggestions/experience of those doing the actual work. Management has no problems making jarring decisions in the middle of productions, but are not as open to what non-management employees have to say. Some--not all--are micromanagers.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
2015-09-08,,,Current Employee ,As corporate as it comes,As corporate as it comes,0,"The people you work with are nice and pleasant people, trying to do good work everyday. They make being at an oppressive work place manageable",The management and upper levels are far above the workers; we aren't treated like people but like dispensable revolving door replacements. It's not uncommon to say hello to someone in the morning and never see them again. people are secretly laid off and management says nothing. It's sneaky and creates an atmosphere of fear.,"You claim to live the mission, but clearly it's the margin...as long as it benefits the top tiers. Morale is at an all time low and you do nothing but stoke the fires. Shame on you.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
2015-08-10,,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,"Strange Days, Indeed","Strange Days, Indeed",0,Wonderful co-workers. Jesuit focus on mission and ministry. Short working hours. Extended Christmas vacation. Joe Paprocki & others.,"The odd veteran employee with unresolved anger-management issues. Dept. managers hired & fired with bewildering rapidity. A company president who can't bare to hear the truth about the damage ""kiss-up, kick-down"" rage-aholics inflict on the business. Secretive management culture. A not-for-profit organization obsessed with profit. Elitist snobs brushing shoulders with men & women attempting to live an authentic Catholic mission.

-Great vacation time
-Free food
-Free parking on Ashland and surrounding area.
-Great neighborhood to have an office (albeit not a great location for a commute)
-Great people (aside from Management) that work very hard.","-Management. Is. Awful.
-Working feels like if I were on the show ""Survivor"". I feel like to fit in I need to make alliances with people nonstop...people make assumptions on how ""Jesuit"" you're being on a given day...
-****Huge point-Management encourages employees to rat other employees out if they ""aren't on brand"". A very subjective thing. Culture is tense-like cutting through the air with a knife.
-Noooobody trusts anyone here and morals and values are questioned constantly.","I took this job because I wanted to help people. Unfortunately, it's so hard to be happy here that when I tell people where I work I just get angry and disappointed. More importantly, a place my experience at a place like this with all the ""kind, good hearted, religious people"" has me questioning my faith and that's really sad.

Advice? Like most have said in these reviews...a new CEO is needed-desperately. This isn't the Illuminati...it's a Catholic publishing company. I have felt nervous going to the bathroom for fear of what someone will think. ""Has he gone to the bathroom too many times today?"" I kid you not, you'd be amazed at what I've been questioned about. Shocking and sometimes I think illegal in the workplace.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

-You get two weeks off in the winter around Christmas.
-There's always something to eat, but beware. Once food has been left in the kitchen, you only have a few minutes to get some before the plates are practically licked clean by everyone else. It's actually quite impressive. I'm not lying.

-The hypocrisy is worse.
-Management consistently changes and the company president does not run things well. Management by fear.

It was always easy to get people to work with you, or go along with what you were working on. We were just one big happy family, and that seemed to be the prevailing attitude while I was there ('97 to 2004). With Fr. George lane constantly coming around with his infectious smile, careful to greet every person by name.","Sometimes ( especially during the summer) the place got busy. And when it got busy everything, at least in the Warehouse got bust, and somewhat tense. We had a great group of workers, but some people just don't work well under pressure. And in the summertime Loyola Press in the warehouse had pressure.","Don't push so hard, especially in the summer. Learn to smile a bit more even if you have to fake it. Go back to the annual Bonus.
