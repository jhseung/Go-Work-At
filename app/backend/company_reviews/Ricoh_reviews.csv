2019-03-15, OnSite Floater,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"Depends Greatly on the Site - We were ""The Help"" for a Law Firm","Depends Greatly on the Site - We were ""The Help"" for a Law Firm",0,Best thing was that benefits started after one month of employment (health insurance left much to be desired though); coworkers were fine to work with.,"I disliked feeling like I was The Help for a law firm. Our management wouldn't stand up to the law firm people at all for things they weren't supposed to do: for instance, Ricoh employees were only supposed to wash law firm-branded mugs, but the law firm would routinely put personal cups and dishes in the sinks with the expectation that we were going to wash them. However, management often railed on us for the smallest things: for some reason, when a wireless mouse was absent-mindedly left behind in a conference room overnight, *Ricoh* got in trouble for it, even though we had also been instructed not to touch any AV equipment in case we messed it up. These are just two examples; situations like this would happen regularly, and it was frustrating that Ricoh always received the blame and the law firm was never held up to their end of the site contract.

There were other difficulties: the policy was only one employee is able to take a day off at a time, which made it very difficult for me to schedule my doctor's appointments as a pregnant woman, and no accommodations were made for my pregnancy, so I was often exposed to cleaning supplies, toner, standing in one place for long periods, and frequent crouching and bending when I should have been put on lighter duties (which were available as a mailroom attendant). Also, even though they didn't want us on our phones, the only way to log into the Ricoh RWorld employee site was to get a text or call on your phone for verification, and there wasn't even cell service in many parts of the building.

In all in I had a horrible experience at my specific Ricoh site, particularly because I felt disrespected; my fellow coworkers and I were treated like children while still expected to bend over backwards for a site where we were primarily babysitting lawyers and not integral to the workplace. Obviously it may not be like this at other Ricoh sites, but the site I worked at was incredibly uptight with management that didn't care much and was more devoted to the firm than to us. Try to do as much research on the site where you'll be working before accepting a position as an onsite employee with Ricoh.","Hire site managers who actually care about their Ricoh team instead of just the client (and discipline those that are being disrespectful and dismissive), allow more than one employee off per day, RWorld should have never switched to Sitepoint, and make it easier to accommodate pregnant employees who don't have an office to retreat to.",1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

Don't care for their employees. There is no training or career development and they rarely promote from within unless it is a Japanese hire brought over for their 5 year stint overseas. All new hires quickly start looking for another job once they understand the real corporate culture. So much turnover in prod. they can't fill the spaces and those left get stuck with mandatory overtime of unreasonable continuous work days.,None since they don't have any common business sense nor listen to those who do.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
