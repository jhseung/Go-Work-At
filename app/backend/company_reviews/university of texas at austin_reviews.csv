2019-01-02, Study Abroad Program Coordinator,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,"Great place to learn, but not to advance",More than 3 years,0,"Everyone generally likes the higher education environment as a place to grow and learn. UT attracts some great people because of its name, so my colleagues are pretty great, with unique experiences and perspectives. The students at UT are really great to work with and supervise, with rare exceptions. I have supervised quite a few in the office and they have almost all amazed me with their accomplishments. The International Office is good at what it does, by many measures, and has a long track record of successful programming in the International Office. It stands out among peer institutions and in the field of international education. Leadership tries to do their best for staff with budget constraints and workload (see below).","Everyone in education always jokes that the pay is bad, so you are there because you love it. But that is really the case in Texas. The pay is very low relative to comparable positions, and while UT tries to add other benefits, they aren't that competitive to make up for the salary, especially with rising inflation, cost of living in Austin, and the cost of insurance. There also aren't really any advancement strategies for entry or mid-level positions. Bureaucracy, state legislation, and budget constraints (real or constructed) result in no pay raises and little to no professional development. The International Office is in better shape than most other academic departments on campus, though, since it can utilize fees from programming. Leadership tends to get mired in the mindset that there are too many battles to fight, and improving salaries for staff is too hard a battle to fight with the university. The result is burn-out among staff and a revolving door, especially among entry-level staff. There seems to be relatively little strategic planning. It tries to justify what it does based on data, instead of planning what it should do based on data. When I applied, I made it clear that I was interested in growing with the organization and asked about prospects for advancement, and was mislead to think it was a possibility to advance. Later I discovered that in order to advance to a mid-management position, I needed to have had supervised full-level staff in my previous work experience. This essentially creates a barrier for any entry-level staff to grow, and means that they have to go somewhere else. The office loses their expertise and knowledge, and create perpetual problems with team workload and continually needing to train new staff. HR practices assume that previous experience in terms of years yields better candidates. It's like this in most places I have seen across higher education, but a better system of applying and interviewing that addresses fit and incorporates areas the candidate can grow and contribute.",Develop a strategic plan and cast a vision. Let all workers at all levels apply the plan to learning outcomes for their own work. Focus on the plan instead of numbers. Adjust salaries for cost of living.

And because all of your colleagues are state employees that have probably worked here for many years in the exact same job, don't expect them to volunteer a lot of information or explanation. There is almost zero training on the archaic and very specific UT Austin systems. They will point you to wiki's and broken links and then just shrug when you have question. You are very much on your own to learn your job. They just say ""That's how UT is.""
Staff is at the bottom of the totem pole at UT. First students (customers). Then faculty. Then the staff. And when it comes to salaries - expect a very modest annual increase. No one will get rich on staff (unless your in athletics or the President's office).

Excellent network of highly qualified and accredited researchers to work with, some of whom take on graduate students. GBDS has a very large database of GIS data, continental and offshore seismic lines in and around the Gulf of Mexico (mostly proprietary), academic publications, and mapping software, made available to sponsors and affiliated researchers (including graduate and doctoral students).","Funding for GBDS comes directly from sponsors, most of which are industry related oil and gas companies, meaning all department finances (employee salaries, research funding, etc.) are entirely reliant on the success and momentum of oil and gas and their market value - as such, GBDS is heavily controlled by politics. Additionally, undergraduate student workers have predominantly one job, digitizing well logs, which equates to tracing a line with a mouse for hours on end; the environment is also very quiet and can be a bit dreary and depressing at times.","Refrain from letting interdepartmental politics so heavily dictate operations and stifle relationships between researchers. While GBDS is an academic research project of a higher learning institution, being cutthroat in regards to publication co-authorships or ones job status within the project does nothing but hinder the efficiency and end product of the very research being conducted.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0
