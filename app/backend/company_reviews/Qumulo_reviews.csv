2018-08-18, Member of Technical Staff,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,The best job I've ever had in my life.,The best job I've ever had in my life.,0,"The hiring bar is really high. Everyone you work with is a brilliant A+ contributor. The dedication to the craft of good software engineering is unlike anything I have anywhere else. I have worked at 4 other software companies prior to this, including Amazon, and after a whole year I am still waking up everyday with a smile on my face, knowing I get to show up and work with the best people on one of the the most technically complex and advanced filesystem products in the world. It's some of the best automated test coverage I have ever seen. The entire testing pyramid is thought about, all the way from low level unit tests, mid-level integration tests, to high-level system tests. In addition, there is a human certification process. The release cadence is every 2 weeks, on the dot. That's right, we ship an entire OS appliance image every 2 weeks because of the fantastic test coverage. There's no on-call, there's only volunteering to be on the customer support escalation team, which is a team that you volunteer to be on for 3 months, and then rotate off. There's no managers. No risk of having to deal with a jerk who isn't very technical or doesn't know how to actually be a good manager, yet has all the power over your comp and performance reviews. The engineering org is flat, self-managing, with responsibilities typically handled by a manager sharded out between engineers and some directors of engineering. Your performance is audited by your team. Your feedback comes from your team, but you discuss comp and get feedback from a director. There are agile coaches which help manage the meetings and drive the process. There is an advisor program so you can have regular 1on1's with someone to discuss your career and any problems you are having. Your career trajectory is totally up to you - you are in control and it's very empowering.

The ability to switch teams is very flexible. You are not stuck anywhere you don't want to be. Not happy? Switch teams.

Everyone I work with, I enjoy. Like all jobs, I wouldn't call them friends, but I at least have a lot of respect for them, and I don't mind grabbing drinks with them.","Naturally, there are some cons to every company, but I don't want them to take away from how great working in this company as an engineer is. But for one, most people are going to be coming from a hierarchical culture, where there is one authority figure: your manager. It's a bit jarring at first not to have that one person telling you if you are doing good or bad. But that goes away with time, as you become more confident and you begin to trust and use getting feedback from your team and the people around you as your signals of how you are doing.

The ability to switch teams often, and having such a dynamic engineering culture is that sometimes the ownership of code is lost - and bugs crop up that require a long ramping up to understand the system where the bug is happening and how to fix it. So there's some cost in this model.

There's a small divide between engineering and the rest of the company. It's sometimes hard to get visibility in what marketing and sales are doing, and it's not unheard of that sometimes marketing or sales throws engineering under the bus. They over-sell something or sell something to a customer with the wrong expectations and engineering has to scramble to close the gap. Or sales/marketing go off and try to pull off something technical in secret, only to realize at the last second that it's not going to work and they need engineering's help - and a team has to rapidly context switch to figure out what's going on. Then because it's a different arm of the company, the feedback loop sometimes doesn't get closed to relay back to them that ""hey, this isn't OK"".","I don't think I could do a better job, but there are some schisms between marketing & sales vs product & engineering. Those need to be closed. The long-term vision is also a bit fuzzy. Keep the culture and high hiring bar!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
