- Beautiful SF office!
- Extremely interesting industry
- The company is maturing and transitioning from the typical startup to a more structured org

2019-03-26, Senior Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Volatile but rewarding environment,More than a year,0,"Unusually high degree of autonomy.
I've worked here for two years and the thing I love most is the ability to push initiatives and have a direct hand in how the company operates. Company culture is quite unlike any place I've worked previously. There's a lot of camaraderie and in-jokes among the engineering team, without going so far that people seem unprofessional or immature.

Work life balance is quite decent. There's crunches at times, but we don't glorify them. On call support works on rotation, and has improved dramatically in my time here (rather low stress these days).

Career growth opportunities feel pretty exceptional here if you're able to take a lot of ownership. I've felt fortunate to find a place I can focus more on the work than playing politics and fighting for raises. Engineering managers do a decent enough job of being advocates, and not micro-managing.

Overall I believe this place does well at rewarding people who communicate clearly, directly, and in good faith. I'd say it especially favors people who are willing to do more than simply execute on tech specs and are willing to get their hands dirty with the ""glue work"" as it were.

Overall, in engineering at least, I'm pretty happy this place hasn't become a stereotypical tech bro playground, as may be often assumed by outsiders.","Volatile industry creates thrash in priorities.
Understaffed leads to a lot of thrash in priorities.
Uncertainty leads to a bit of ""shooting from the hip"" from management at times (which is what on the same token, creates the opportunity for autonomy to thrive) but still, creates thrash.

Most top level priorities have been too product focused for a while, and engineering hasn't had the proper chance to really address issues with legacy systems.
Tech debt persists despite relatively small initiatives to alleviate it.",Work on defining career development paths better. Some people thrive in a more open ended environment while some need a more concrete path of expectations defined.,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

- I've been at a number of companies that advertised a ""fun"" culture, Eaze is the only one that lives up to that promise (especially within Product & Engineering)

- Managers and leadership that are compassionate, care about employees' well-being and willing to work with you when personal needs come up

Management is sketch, every problem is replied with a “we’re working on it!” When it finally happens it’s a lazy version. Drivers asked for better bathroom situation. Management said we got porcelain toilets that ended up still being porta potties. Management said they were increasing our pay but only by $1 morning shifts and $2 evening shifts.

- Constantly changing, get experience working with multiple departments and directly impact the company's success

- Strong leadership

- Solid investment backing and rapidly growing revenue - Eaze isn't going away anytime soon.

- First to market and leader in the industry.

- A rock-solid legal team in an industry with many legally gray areas helps inspire confidence in company longevity.

- Generous PTO and awesome HR. In a constantly changing / unstable environment (such is the nature of a startup / the marijuana industry), HR is reliable, consistent and works tirelessly to serve Eaze employees and improve their quality of life.

- A great place to take your career to the next level

- Diverse and evolving company culture

- Awe-inspiring growth and success.

- As ""Flat"" as a company can be at the stage it's at. Still a hierarchy and risk of being siloed, but vastly improved over the past year and upper management is consciously working to continue to improve.

- Work with multiple departments and directly with execs on a daily basis to ensure daily operational success.

- Great office locations

- Incredible opportunity to grow/develop career and skill sets in entry and mid level positions (but you must pursue it aggressively, nothing is handed to you).

- Eaze is not disrupting a market, they have created a new one and continue to develop new initiatives which are shaping the industry

- There is no ""Lyft to Uber"" for Eaze. Eaze is well funded and internal numbers are constantly shattering records. As leadership regularly reminds the company, ""Our biggest competition is ourselves - this is ours to lose.""

- Eaze is making money AND helping people at the same time. A rare combination in business! It makes for a very satisfying and fulfilling job.

- Jim Patterson, the CEO, makes sure to be accessible and responsive to all employees (which is quite an accomplishment given his daily workload and responsibilities). He does not, however, initiate communication with employees he doesn't directly work with day-to-day which can be perceived as disinterest. If you are waiting for your opportunity to establish/develop your relationship with the CEO, don't. Just initiate the conversation and Jim will engage.","- Incredibly high level of stress with zero tolerance for excuses

- Work most / all holidays and weekends due to peak hours being when everyone else is not at work.

- Poor communication from leadership

- #1 problem-solving method: ""throw more money at it"" which can be detrimental when a permanent/long-term solution is critical and/or time sensitive.

- Management is inadequate at detecting signs of burnout and low morale and tends to abandon those who burn out. Many incredible employees have been let go or left because of this which is very costly to the company in terms of churn and acquiring/retaining talent.

- If you want to grow your career within the company, you must do your current job perfectly while additionally exceeding expectations and doing the job you want to be promoted to. This proves to be all but impossible sometimes. When you set the bar too high and fail to meet expectations you're shooting yourself in the foot. However, not setting the bar high enough often results in missed opportunities. Finding the balance between consistently delivering what's expected and exceeding expectations on a regular basis is difficult but essential.

- A barrier between mid-level employees and career development. For leadership positions (ie VP, Head of, Director, etc) Eaze does not promote from within. This creates a barrier for entry level employees as a result since mid-level positions only open up when a team lead/manager is fired or leaves.","Continue to prioritize closing the gap between management and employees. At the current stage the company is in, working as one cohesive unit is critical. When this is not the case, it has proven to have catastrophic results.

Communicate with other departments and study/learn what they do and how they do it. Oftentimes the solution to a problem lies within another department's expertise.

Execs / VP's have a poor understanding of how entry / mid level employees do their job and what they do which often leads to confusion and backlash for the entry and mid level employees. A VP / Exec at a tech company asking an entry level employee how they do the most basic form of data entry does not inspire confidence.

Eaze has four company motto's which define its culture. The one motto which employees regularly fail to follow is ""Say what you do, do what you say."" It's a great motto and inspires confidence until it isn't true.

Continue the Win the Day initiative and continue to rotate members from each department as representatives for Win the Day. This has huge value for company success as well as employee morale.

Continue to invest in the development and improvement of management. In recent months Eaze has more aggressively invested time and resources in manager training/improvement and it has had an incredibly positive impact. Keep that momentum going!

2016-07-06,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best Company I've Worked At,More than a year,0,"Eaze is working on a problem that everyone here is truly passionate about. We are working toward a mission.

I've not found a better place to grow as an employee. I started here as one of the earliest members of the team and I've found great mentors internally within the executive team and have always had an easy time engaging any member of the exec team when I need support/advice as I grow in my contribution and role in the company.

The employee culture is fantastic--everyone here is truly friends with everyone else.

The business itself is growing like a rocketship--I've worked at and been involved in numerous fast growing venture backed startups, but none of them have as much growth and growth potential as Eaze.","This isn't a place for people who need a lot of direction in order to succeed; though, as we scale, we're growing in our capacity to manage more junior team members. There's a lot of work to be done...and sometimes my girlfriend complains about my work commitment, but that's my choice after all--opportunities like this rarely arise. :)","Keep doing what you're doing:
- hiring great people
- disseminating company priorities effectively
- keeping dialogue open
