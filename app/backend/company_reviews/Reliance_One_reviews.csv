I have worked both directly for Reliance One as a temporary Administrative Assistant as well as a contract employee for various automotive companies. Both experiences over the years have been wonderful.

While working directly for Reliance One in their Auburn Hills office I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The culture is fun yet professional; competitive yet supportive. I often saw employees going out to lunch together leading me to believe that close relationships were established and they genuinely enjoyed each other's company. The longer I worked for them, the more I realized this was true.

I often found myself laughing and smiling each day while working with the rest of the administrative/accounts payable/human resources team. We were all held to a high standard of quality work by the VP of Administration, however with her kindness and real life outlook she was easily relate-able making us want to succeed in our department and help the company grow.

Throughout the year they have a variety of employee engagement events: Tiger's Games, Chili Cook Offs, Team Dinners, etc. They are involved heavily in giving back to the community and also reward their employees with a wonderful Holiday Party and Awards Ceremony at the end of the year. I also notice there are many training opportunities for their committed employees helping to advance them in their careers. While you are expected to work hard for them, they will also work hard for you!

While working as a contract employee for various companies I was able to experience them as a recruiting company as well. Each account manager I have worked for has been nothing short of professional. They genuinely want to see you succeed and help you in doing do. The last position I took through them was for an automotive company which was intended to be 6 months contract then direct hire. After going through the interview process, they assisted in the negotiation process after I expressed my wishes to shorten the contact time and increase pay. I was more than impressed with the commitment from both the recruiter and the account manager. Both checked in on me periodically and celebrated with me by taking me to lunch.

Over the years I have always referred Reliance One to friends or family looking for jobs because I know they will work hard for them and set them up to be successful.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2018-11-16,,"Bingham Farms, MI",Former Employee ,Technical Recruiter,Technical Recruiter,0,"They allow employees to play Nintendo during lunch, and have even seen employees playing during work hours.","I would not recommend working for or with this company. The entire company culture is very unprofessional, often vulgar, and all about just hitting your numbers at the end of the week. The numbers are there to gain ""rewards"" based on performance, and when employees start to regularly hit the numbers goals, the system changes to make it harder.

When joining the company they sold the idea that they are there to create relationships with the candidates and clients, which is untrue. The goal is to send people to jobs to get the number quota, without really taking the time to qualify. This goes back to the numbers game. You end up just sending people to the client just to keep up on your numbers, often sending people who are not completely qualified, just for the sake of hitting the quota.

On top of all of that, there is a high stress point placed on getting ""leads"" or references from candidates, just so that they can reach out to the employer to see if they are involved with a staffing agency. I feel that this is a very shady and unprofessional way to build a ""relationship"" business.

Most of the blame and stress gets laid out on the bottom level employees, who are also expected to work after work hours on a regular basis (not overtime). If you do not fit in with the culture, meaning that you will just blindly take orders from management without much question, and blindly ignore a lot of unprofessional banter around the office, you will not fit in.

Lastly, I got sick, went to urgent care and was given medicine to take care of a contagious illness (strep throat), took a day off to recover and then went to work the next day. I was asked if I was going to work from home while I was sick. Later that week was terminated for lack of performance. Mind you this is the week before Thanksgiving, and shortly before Christmas.
