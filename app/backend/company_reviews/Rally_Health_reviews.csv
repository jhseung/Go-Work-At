Culture is great. Can't really go wrong with whoever you meet, especially with the open lunch tables or even all the Rallyers you see on your daily commute.

Very flexible work. You may still end up doing more or less than the typical 40 hour work week, but the ability to freely work from home or take time off for appointments, family, or personal matters really makes all the difference.

Modern tech stack. May not be the absolute latest and greatest, but it's definitely up there when it comes to pace and the technologies adapted/going to be adapted.","Compensation. Not much else to say - this is the biggest complaint. You're practically screwed with whatever you come in as. Do your best to fight for what's right when you get an offer (don't settle for over 10% under fair market value like my mistake). Also, do your best to communicate with your manager as much as possible about your career goals. The shadow of the big company (UnitedHealthcare) will probably still prevent you from really achieving it, but you can at least say you tried and can really see if your managers value and vouch for you. This is not to say that your work itself won't be rewarding - there are many opportunities to accept more responsibilities, take ownership of features, learn from a lot of the really smart people around you, etc., but be prepared for minimal compensation for those efforts. Even the engineers that I know have been there longer than me are not content with their compensation, and I'm sure most everyone around them would agree that they definitely deserve more for their efforts. You probably have a higher chance of getting a promotion/raise by applying to an internal job posting that usually lists a significantly higher compensation than to actually get promoted from your current role.

Seems like hit-or-miss with management. Thanks to the culture pro mentioned above, I've got to meet so many people with different experiences: you seem to either get an amazing manager that makes you never want to leave or one that has opportunities to improve.

Totally first-world tech problem, but the snacks could be better or at least restocked more. The snacks haven't changed much for as long as I've been here and even then, they are not keeping up with how quickly the San Francisco office is growing - fruit is only restocked every other day and they are all usually gone by 11am the same day of being restocked.","You're in such a great position with so many great people who really want to stick around and see things through with a great company and mission. We're all in this together and have ambitious career goals - please continue looking out for yourselves, but please also keep looking out for those of us right there with you.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0
2019-03-15, Senior Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,A good company with a few serious flaws they need to address,A good company with a few serious flaws they need to address,0,"The culture is very respectful of employee time. We have unlimited PTO, and mostly mean it. If you are sick, need a day off for family, have a vacation, it's no big deal as long as you give reasonable notice and get your work done.

Workload varies by team, but increasingly teams are committed to maintaining a respectful work life balance. Most of management, at least on the engineering side, gets that you can't just 'program harder' and get better results.

The engineering leadership takes investing in tech debt seriously. That is a newer shift, and is taking time to trickle down to every team, but Rally really does seem committed to being a serious, high quality engineering org.","Rally has basically one huge cons: they are extremely reluctant to promote people (and somewhat reluctant to give them market-adjustment raises).

Rally has a very clearly defined engineering career ladder. All of the responsibilities for a given role are clearly outlined. If you meet a certain percentage of the requirements for the next role up, you are supposed to get promoted. But it just doesn't work that way. In practice, privately, engineers are told that they have to meet all the requirements for the job title they want for a full year before they are eligible for promotion. Even then, it's a fight. We've seen team leads stuck at Software Engineer II for years while new hires on their teams are three or four career levels above them , people with 8 direct reports never given a management promotion, and numerous top performers who've left saying 'the reason I left is you didn't promote me to a role matching my responsibility.'

For employees with long tenure, this is particularly frustrating because new hires are held to a much lower standard than tenured employees. For new hires, we basically level you based on what you made at your last job, for existing employees, you need to be a hero to get a promotion.

Pay for new hires is very competitive, so you have to stick around a few years for this to be a problem. If you come in at senior level, you might not even notice it, because it's not that odd for a senior or principal engineer to take some time to move up if they do at all. But for midlevel engineers, it's kind of a trap.","You need a total overhaul of the promotion decision making process. From the outside, it looks like its being driven more by finance and execs than by engineering managers. It almost feels like there's a quota of the number of promotions that can be handed out. It doesn't take a genius to tell you that's a bad idea in a competitive market. You're trying to hire hundreds of new engineers - you can't afford to lose all your existing ones because you lied to them about their career prospects.

The overhaul isn't even that hard. Just use the rubric/career expectation framework you have, stick to it, and apply it universally to all engineers. Either suck up the fact that this means promoting a ton of people, or adjust the framework to be harder. Just actually do what you say you're going to, and you'll be fine.

Oh, also, anyone with de facto or actual direct reports should have more compensation regardless of their title. This should be a no-brainer. You can't keep stealth making people managers and not compensating them for the extra responsibility.

It also would pay to be more honest about the career ladder. If you want higher standards for promotion, that's fine - just be honest with your employees about what those standards are. Discrepancies between stated policy and reality destroy trust.",3.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0
2019-03-27,,,Current Employee ,Used to be much better,Used to be much better,0,"- The company's mission is something you can truly get behind.

- Most of the people you work with are truly exceptional at what they do.

- Most of the exception people ^ genuinely care about the mission. It drives us.

- Opportunities for career growth still exist, but you really have to play politics to get them.

- Unlimited/flexible PTO is a great perk, but you really have to make yourself take it

- Free lunch (varying quality each day)

- Benefits are solid, but used to be MUCH better","- Starting to lose a lot of the great things about our culture. Infinitely more corporate since the UHG acquisition, and some of the cool perks like paid vacations for hitting certain tenures and quarterly Rally Awards with company-wide recognition have been replaced by a ""black box"" quarterly check-in cycle that no one seems to understand or benefit from a year after it was implemented.

- Compensation is mediocre at best unless you are an engineer in San Francisco. HR will say ""we benchmark against the best"", but when you see this same feedback consistently across the company it is clear that what they are saying simply isn't true.

- Inconsistent management at lower and middle levels. Managers are generally poorly trained and do not seem to be held accountable for high turnover.

- All of our products are built in silos and almost nothing was built for scalability. This makes integrating our products into a single ""platform"" nearly impossible.","Never lose sight of the company's mission. That's the one truly positive thing left, and it is why most of us stay. Keep that mission at the center of what you do.

Value your people. Pay your people. And I don't mean just the engineers. You can build the greatest product in the world, but without support from the rest of the company no one could ever use it.

- There are several rock stars who have been with the company for 3+ years and are some of the most talented people I've ever worked with. Unfortunately, many are leaving out of frustration.","- Decisions are made by leadership with little involvement or input from internal experts at the company. It's not only a process problem but also an attitude problem.
- The performance review process sucks. There is no channel for upward feedback, no calibration of reviews across managers, and no insurance that top performers will be recognized when their manager is not a good advocate.
- Career opportunities are more correlated to one's self promotion and personal relationships with execs than competence. While this is true elsewhere, usually the performance review process sheds light on who the top performers are, even if they're not good self promoters or buddies with an exec. That's not the case here, and it makes Rally a challenging and demoralizing environment to grow a career.","- Revamp the performance review process

2019-03-03, Senior Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Company OK, but avoid Data","Company OK, but avoid Data",0,"Rally isn't a bad company to work for overall. While pay is below what you'll be able to find elsewhere in SF, there are solid benefits (catered lunches, very flexible schedule) that make up for it. A small 401k match. Other benefits are decent, but not what they used to be. As the company has grown teams have become far less nimble, but there are still pockets of strong passion and talent.","The data pillar is a disaster. With experienced data engineers being a hot commodity, we were unable to bring in new members for some time. If you were good enough to pass the interview we were giving, you were good enough to be hired for more elsewhere. New leadership responded to this by removing the team's ownership of the interview process . We began hiring individuals at very senior levels with no related experience, and often limited ability of any sort.

If you have no experience I would avoid this team because it is a toxic environment with few to learn from. If you have experience I would avoid this team because the team itself would drive you crazy and you'll be working for the worst management chain of your career. The on-call rotation also tends to be brutal/sleep-depriving.",Clean house if you want things to get better. Much smaller data teams are doing a whole lot more with a whole lot less.

- Work from home policy is also flexible
- Technical stack is okay; mediocre really
- If you are willing to set strict boundaries with your managers/teams you can have very good work life balance here.
- If you get lucky you can have good managers who care about your growth within the company. You could however get unlucky and get the opposite
- If you want a job where you can cruise and are okay with your current base salary and minimal raises this place can be amazing","- Compensation is below market rate, especially if you have been with the company for a number of years. For this reason alone I'd recommend all candidates to negotiate the highest possible base salary during the interview process.
- Compensation adjustment even for top performers are not able to keep up with market rates; I believe this is due to the company's internal process for how funds are allocated towards bonuses and raises. I would recommend new or mid-level engineers to leave after 2 years as your market value will far outpace any compensation adjustments you will receive here.
- There are free lunches but the quality of the food is very poor. Mostly staples such as rice, potatoes/starchy food, ""salads"", and bland mystery meats that sometimes require you to identify them by reading the tray labels. Many employees actually prefer Taco Bell down the street over the free lunch. The lunches used to be much more palatable in the past.
- The ""free beer on tap"" is also always out. The tap will stay empty for weeks. (The only reason this made it into the review is because almost every recruit is told of the free beer and daily lunches; I feel it is only fair they know the truth)
- Holiday season is the busiest at this company. Many of the business deliverables have deadlines around the new year and unfortunately many are not defined well enough for development until 4 months before the deadline. Meaning development really starts around Fall, starts to ramp up in November and by Thanksgiving the stress levels are astronomic. They typically remain high up until Christmas and around NYE as well.","First and foremost keep it professional and respectful. I have witnessed some questionable behavior from upper management directed at others in the management nexus. This sort of behavior appears to have been on the decline for over a year now, so kudos to you guys there.

Secondly the rise of large organizational bureaucracy has turned rally from an agile company into a slow sluggish behemoth. This used to be a fun tech company to work at. Now there is so much red-tape I often find myself wasting countless days or hours just navigating the bureaucracy instead of actually doing my job (this is more relevant to the engineering organization than the the company).

Third and one of the most important would be to set realistic business expectations as to what is achievable in a reasonable timeline. Every year new business initiatives are created with end of year deadlines yet they are not finalized until at least mid-year or Fall leaving the entire company scrambling under intense pressure through the holiday season. This is a change that needs to come from the very top.",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

Decent health benefits
Helping folks live healthier lives","Important to note that I work within Real Appeal and the management could be different from Rally Health since Rea Appeal was recently absorbed into Rally Health (which was not told to me upon my hiring even though the change just took place).
Management has no idea what's going on and is constantly micromanaging and attempting to put new policies and procedures in place to save face from disgruntled employees.
They will lie directly to you in meetings and constantly go back on their word.
After abruptly announcing changes to the job duties of the coaching staff we were all told, in a meeting, that if we were unhappy it's not their fault and that we need to go elsewhere. I'm assuming this happened because mgt sent several google form surveys asking how we felt and apparently didn't like the feedback. We were all told we would be getting raises, but it wasn't true. We had a reason to be upset. We were directly lied to about pay.
If you bring up a complaint or issue you're usually reprimanded or ignored. There is no clear way to contact anyone except for your team lead, we're told we cannot contact any upper level mgt on our own, if you do you are scolded.
Minimal training with incredible expectations and standards with no direct way to achieve any of them. You're observed and rated by your team lead, but the evaluation is completely subjective and depends on who you get.
Seems like they hire unqualified folks so they can keep pay to a minimum.
Absolutely no transparency or honesty with this company. You can be told one thing and get praised for it and then the next day it be an issue.
They'll tell you there is constant room for growth, but in reality you can't even make a lateral move, even if you beg them for one.
10 hour work days with no room for changes. I work four 10 hour shifts a week and it's 10:30 am - 9 pm. I took a work from home job for the flexibility, but have less of a life now that when commuting. They anticipate you to be near your PC all day, to the extent we were told we cannot leave our homes during a break.
Workload for the pay is disgusting. We work directly with members, often in one on one sessions which turn into free therapy sessions, 20+ hours of our work weeks for scrap. No recognition or room for forward movement no matter how much you care or how hard you work.
Even if you know you're a stellar employee, you won't here. The environment is so demoralizing it's incredible.","Clean house and start over!
No one in management seems to know what they are doing. Things change on a moments notice and information is never clear.
All hands meetings are a complete joke because we spend the first 10 minutes watching management try to figure out how to use their computers, it's embarrassing.
Treat your coaches with respect and pay them better... Considering without them you'd have no income, it seems like it's the least you could do.
Further, cut the crap. There is so much that's constantly being implemented and for no reason. Actually start listening to your employee complaints and give us a reason to care about the company.

Pros:
- Very entrepreneurial. Lots of white space for business owners, product leaders, and engineers to contribute in meaningful ways.
- Mission-driven. The team is focused on changing the face of health care, and has a plan to do it.
- Growth oriented. The company is growing quickly, and while that comes with some pains, there are real opportunities to contribute to meaningful growth -- both for the company and in terms of career opportunities.
- Flexibility. You're treated like a grown-up here. In many positions, though not all, that means you can work from home, flex your hours, or meet a contractor if you need to. Just get your work done!
- Start up feel. Rally isn't really a start up anymore, but it still maintains that feel. Free lunches, celebrations of milestones & birthdays, open office space, and a strong sense of culture. Each office's feel is different, to be sure, but management is consciously leaning in to make sure that working here doesn't feel like you're at a corporate machine.

If you end up working on those teams, you'll find yourself on one of the best engineering teams you've ever worked with. People are dedicated to constantly refining processes and improving not just the code we write but the way we write code.
- Historically, it's had a great culture around work-life balance. If you're on the right team, unlimited vacation really does mean that you can take time when you need it within reason.
- Related to the above, it's a good place if you have kids. We really do a good job of giving people lots of space and time for their personal needs
- Up until now, there's been a very casual, open culture. Management is in the process of dismantling this, but it was great while it lasted.","- Some teams have a really toxic engineering culture. Sloppy development practices, unofficial decision making driven by favoritism, no concern for quality and no accountability. There's a lot of terrible Not Invented Here syndrome, where people build their own custom solutions for problems that have long been solved in open source. The custom solutions are invariably terrible. If you end up on QA or Engage, you're going to have a terrible time.
- See other reviews for issues of sexism/toxic culture in some offices
- Compensation is WAAAAY below market rate.
- Most of what's good about Rally's culture is on the way out. We're getting rid of the great benefits and a lot of the casual culture. At this point, it looks like it won't be too long before we're at 2 weeks vacation and business casual dress, and Rally is just another corporate division of UHC. I'd say the good days for this company are past, which is a real shame because we were starting to fix a lot of the problems with the culture.","- Pay your engineers market rate. If you aren't paying them market rate, fix it. You are trying to compete with Google, Microsoft and Facebook on comp, culture and benefits. You aren't going to get that underpaying developers. At this point, post-acquisition, your stock options are worth very little. You need to start paying developers developer salaries
- Good developers don't want to, or need to, work at a corporate cube farm. While some of the recent changes are good, especially those motivated by concerns of diversity and sensitivity to employee concerns, many of them feel like a slow slide into corporate beureaucratic death. Specifically:
-- Reducing the quality and affordability of benefits
-- Ending a lot of the 'fun' components of our culture (HipChat bots etc.) without actually addressing any of the problems with those fun components (e.g. potential outlets for sexism and toxic behavior).
-- Comp getting worse and worse each year
- HR is completely deaf to employee concerns.
- Executives are completely deaf to employee concerns. There are special exceptions in our CTO and some of the higher-ups in engineering
- STOP LYING ABOUT COMP. HR will tell you, endlessly, that they pay at the 90th percentile. Either there are HUGE differences between different engineers at the same seniority level (which is toxic in and of itself), or this is a plain lie. No developer I've talked to is getting paid at higher than the 50th percentile. It's bad enough that you underpaying us, but lying to our faces about this is deeply insulting",2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

People play magic.","The company was acquired by United Healthcare, which saw their stock rise after opting out of Obamacare. Nothing about this company is remotely mission driven. The best benefit that Rally offered was their free healthcare and after the first year of being acquired by a health insurance company, is losing that benefit. Don't be fooled into thinking there is a mission here, it's all about the bottom line.

Sales oversells, then engineering has to work through the holidays in order to deliver. Speak to anyone that has been here for more than 2 years and everyone says they no longer look forward to the holidays because they know they'll have to work through them.

If anyone still believes in the mission, then they either have a lot of stock on the table or downed a lot of Kool aid.

The company's compensation and benefits aren't remotely competitive and with the dwindling benefits and culture, there is nothing attractive about working here.

Overall the company has a very toxic environment. Leadership is a an amalgam of people who don't know what they're doing or people who are only worried about themselves and craps on everyone else below them. Last to help the people who report to them but first to respond to a mass email to take credit for things they had nothing to do with. Don't expect to get very far here unless you enjoy sucking up.

What everyone else said about being in QA and being a woman in this company is true. If you are interested or QA, run away, it's not worth it. There are better places with far more competent QA departments you can join out there and places where they treat women with respect. The expectations for QA leadership is so low, typing with all ten fingers would be considered a feat for them.

The development environments are also a dumpster fire. Nothing is ever working and everyone is constantly trying to debug unstable environments instead of getting actually work done. A company as large as this with as much funding as UHG should be able to get their act together but employee job satisfaction is just not high on their priority list.",Consider promoting people who know what they're doing instead of people who are just very good at stroking your ego.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
