Plays favorites, crosses the line between professional and personal to much. Works her employees way to hard. Starts drama weekly by starting rumors, When she needed to correct me, she made other people do it. Changing seating and changing policies all the time. One week you can do this. The next week you can do that. If one of her friends wants to work from home, then she lets everyone work from home to accomodate her friend. Mood changes daily. Been investigated multiple times by HR, shes lucky people are more afraid of her than HR, otherwise we would have been honest when questioned by HR. I feel bad for everyone else who is left.
