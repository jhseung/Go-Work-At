2019-02-23, Vice President Sales,"Jacksonville, FL",Current Employee ,A wonderful company that is starting to not be so wonderful,More than 5 years,0,"Salesforce is a destination company and there are few places where you will find so many truly interesting and gifted people in one firm. There is a real effort to continue to promote the company's values, including trust and equality. Support for philanthropy is significant (although I would agree with the reviewer who noted that ""volunteer"" activities are often anything but voluntary but rather expected/required. (Not to say that giving back is anything other than positive, but it's just worth noting that most company activities include it as part of the agenda.)

The customers are interesting and the tech is pretty solid. The benefits are what you would expect from a firm that wants to hire top talent, in other words, extensive and high quality.

The company continues to grow at quite a fast rate, and that is an imperative. The acquisitions are part of that and it's quite clear that they are necessary since there is only so much organic growth coming out of the core businesses. If you are in a ""good"" territory / team / department, this may in fact be a dreamjob. There are quite a lots of employees who are able to devote many hours (days) to volunteer causes, company social functions, training opportunities and so on. This is particularly the case if you are employed in one of the hub offices.","The rapid growth and the pressure around quarterly metrics is starting to come at the expense of cohesion and quality. The annual reorganization of the business is quite disruptive and is particularly problematic in business areas where the sales cycles are longer, like the more heavily regulated verticals or larger enterprise environments where aligning stakeholders and building vision takes time. You can work your &#$# off here and have all that worked handed off to someone else in a new fiscal. Happens a lot.

Above the mid management/senior director level, the political environment resembles the Hunger Games. The lack of capable management and the lack of transparency around career progression / promotion are a drag on the business and a significant business risk. The departures of more tenured people should be very concerning to leadership; just look at the difference in the reviews of new (<1 year) employees and those with 5 or more years of experience. It's not a positive marker. There is a reason that the employee survey now asks about the ""psychological safety"" of our workplace. Leadership should be commended for recognizing that this is a problem, but now needs to actually do something to fix it. Just adding a feedback app and calendar reminders to use it are probably not going to get the job done.

Once you are hired, progression within the company can be difficult. There is a policy that all internal transfers should be lateral in terms of grade and compensation, even if an external candidate with the same credentials would be offered significantly more compensation and a bigger title. There is a sense that the only way to get a promotion is often to threaten to (or actually) resign and unfortunately, plenty of evidence that this is an effective strategy.","The company's attention to culture, values and social justice are admirable. Recognize that those efforts also create an expectation within the firm that ALL management will demonstrate those values - something that is far from reality. This is not a problem that is going to be solved with Trailhead. Cultivating good people managers who can support and develop talent within the company should be as much of a priority as sales, and great management talent should be celebrated and rewarded. Likewise, those who treat people poorly, have significant attrition or staff departing for other teams should not be retained in management positions.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

I’ve always felt confident that the company bases its decision making on what is right for our customers and the future of the company. People who are motivated, collaborative, and hard working will succeed here.

It’s a pleasure to work here.","Salesforce is a large company, but you can find an entrepreneurial spirit and freedom in many of the smaller divisions in the company.","Stay true to your values.

2019-02-16, Senior Director,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Good employer that makes themselves look great through extensive marketing,More than 5 years,0,"If you are in the right business area, maintaining a good work/life balance is very easy. There are some employees spending as much as 50% of their time on volunteer activity - literally logging more than a thousand hours of volunteer time a year. The support that the company offers its employees in times of need is exceptional, and the care and understanding of middle management is genuine. I care for all of my team members well being, and support them personally and professionally as much as possible. So do my colleagues.","Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely. Wow.","Focus more on results and less on perception. Eventually the wrong (or right, perhaps?) person will see behind the curtain.",3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

It’s deeply saddening that the actual experience working in Technology and Products is one of constant battles between the cross-functional groups.,"Tension is normal and healthy between different disciplines but here the interactions across PM, UX, and Engineering are aggressive and lack empathy for each other. The focus is on each of the 3 separate orgs - you are on the ‘UX team’, ‘Eng team’, or ‘PM team’ instead of defining culture around the cross- functional team working on a product. This often results in aggressive behavior where each discipline intimidates the other to do what they want or pass blame when something goes wrong. The exec leaders of these orgs verbally battle it out with each other in very public reviews that are streamed across their entire orgs and this sets the example that trickles down throughout the teams.",Offer a way for any employee to point out behavior that does not support the Ohana in a method that feels safe and have the option to get support over the interaction.

If you ever speak up about not liking a decision or thinking something is unfair, you will be punished and “iced out” by your leadership. You get rewarded for good work by getting more work put on your plate without any new resources, and if you speak up about stress or workload, you’re gently and subtly told to just deal with it.","Clean house in the ES department.

I think Salesforce gets a little too comfortable in assuming that their benefits and perks will keep people who, with minimal effort, could substantially increase their wages elsewhere. While they promote a culture of career mobility, you will legitimately be penalized from moving internal (from a $ standpoint and also from a promotion standpoint), so you need to treat it as actually leaving Company A and joining Company B - a totally backwards way of looking at career mobility. Compensation and promotions are as untransparent as I’ve sent at any company I’ve ever worked for.

2019-03-03, Strategic Account Manager,,Current Employee ,Worried about Dot Org as we grow and scale,More than 3 years,0,"We love our vision and mission in higher ed/non profit! If you rock at sales and love academia, then dot org is the place to be! So much growth since I started with dot org three years ago, and lots of new people coming on board with the high growth!","New AEs or people considering coming to dot org – there is a caveat and buyer beware! It’s starting to feel like a sink-or-swim culture with so many new people coming onboard. I’ve been asked to work with numerous new AEs as they stepped into their role since fall/December of 2018. It’s become very clear that we are not taking the right steps to onboard them. New AEs are overwhelmed with the boundless options and tools we give them. Not to mention, for December hires, their RVPs were busy closing FY ’19 business, so our most vulnerable new hires were left to fend for themselves. Hopefully, they’ll get RVP support once FY ’20 kicks off. Bottom line: our intentions are good, but our execution fails them.

It’s interesting that we constantly, almost self-righteously, talk about “the pace of Salesforce” as if it’s a badge of honor that only a few can achieve. Most new AEs coming into higher ed want to achieve and catch onto this pace right away. However, unfortunately we’re sabotaging their success by everything we throw at them (and again, often without RVP support).

The enablement and RVP teams need to do better jobs of sequencing and blocking off the new hire content. Instead, we are throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at them – all at once – and expecting them to make sense of it all. No wonder I get panic-stricken phone calls and text messages at all hours of the day/night from rookies. Many RVPs are telling down their throats for answers, yet we haven’t paced their learning. In our current state of onboarding, I don’t know if even I could make it through this process given the “throw-it-all-at-them” approach we now take.","We can do better at dot org. If we don’t execute better, we’ll lose the great talent we’re bringing in, and that’s expensive. As we all know, higher ed is tightly knit, and talented salespeople will not want to come work for the “chaotic firehose” we are becoming.

We need to get off of our pedestal of “the pace of salesforce” and start helping people survive and thrive; that starts with us. If we say our pace is so unique, then it’s up to us to proactively manage to it and to give new AEs the right content at the right time; stop spraying and praying. If we lose a lot of new AEs within their first year, we have no one to blame but ourselves, and we can’t instinctively write it off with, “well, they just couldn’t keep up.”",3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

2019-02-27, Director,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Slowly becoming one of the worst places I've ever worked,More than 10 years,0,"The salary is good, at least in my role. As many have mentioned, Salesforce is still seen as a destination company and a market leader - so experience here looks good on a resume. I've met some great people here who have stimulated and challenged me - also made some great friends personally.","I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best.

First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here.

Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on.

Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger.

Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth.

As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help.","I mean...I think advice is something if you give if you want something to get better.

It has good benefits, especially the wellness reimbursement and the ESPP (Salesforce stock is pretty good), and it's difficult to get fired (this may vary by department).","Management is full of hyprocrisy. Salesforce's core values include things like transparency and equality, both of which have been completely ignored on our team (and apparently also on other teams after reading other reviews here). There is a complete lack of communication from the top down, which makes our team unable to perform our work well. Furthermore, there is little feedback on how we can get promotions or raises. There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries.

Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager. A lot of people who are great individual contributors get promoted to Manager and aren't very good at their new job of dealing with their direct reports, but upper management doesn't care.

Work life balance is also not very flexible during busy season (which lasts from October through March).","Practice what you preach with regards to transparency and equality.

For a company of this size, I don't think it is possible to avoid the aforementioned cons; that said, new employees who have only worked down or mid-market will need to adjust to a big company work environment, and won't receive much in the way of guidance as to how best to accomplish this.","Stay the course.

All we keep hearing is that, 'they are trying as hard as they can to fight for us'. Well, it's been a year now that we've heard that answer and a year now where nothing has changed.

Either my management has been toying with us for 12 months (which I highly doubt since they've been absolutely incredible since I've been at Salesforce) or whomever my management is fighting with simply doesn't value this team.

The company offers quite a few perks, from free barista-served coffee to lavish holiday parties at which you might see flame throwers or magicians (depending on theme). PTO is good, not great, for newer employees (3 weeks), though another week and a half or so is given for volunteer work (VTO).

 The pay is good, with a 10% annual bonus (assuming your performance reviews are perfect).

I always felt free to be myself and never felt that I had to change my behavior to fit in.

Casual day is every day. There is no outdated mentality at Salesforce wherein employees can only be considered respectable if they are wearing a suit.","Marketing Cloud, at least, is still going through transition pains years after acquisition. Many processes have not worked out kinks yet, and it felt like San Francisco dictated to our office without taking into consideration our unique needs.

During my time in Marketing Cloud Support, we were extremely under-staffed, with a discouragement of using overtime and yet we had to call every customer, every day, and provide them with a two-hour window during which we could call. I have been told that since I left rules have become even stricter. With tight SLAs, little overtime available, and a severe lack of staff, employees were extremely stressed and turnover became a real problem. We did not feel that the company cared whether the requirements of the job were impossible to perform in an 8-hour day. The team that existed when I left earlier this year looks nothing like the current team because of people feeling they had to leave to get out of the situation.

Team leads and managers in Indianapolis were as supportive as they could be given the situation and pressure on them as well. My team often felt that we had no agency in this issue, as leaders in Indianapolis could do nothing against the executives in San Francisco making decisions for us.",Listen to your leaders in the offices created through acquisitions and create a more supportive environment.,4.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

I consider myself lucky to have worked in a company with very smart, talented and driven people.","The issues at Salesforce exist at the department / team level, which are led by terrible managers. This is obviously not the case with all departments - but my rating reflects my horrible experience with my department that has been embroiled in chaos for more than a year, with no end in sight. This department is central enough that the dysfunction here, will eventually result in a bad decisions for all other teams that interact with it.

The leader of this department has created an unhealthy work culture, where people do things because of fear. The leader openly chides senior leadership in public for small infractions, and does not accept dissent. They have openly punished individuals for speaking up. The working style has become uninspiring because pomp and show are prioritized over true value creation - this is demonstrated by the fact that the top achievements of the department as highlighted by the leader themselves are theoretical frameworks, and not actual proven methodologies. There are many smart people on the team, but the leader has narrowed in to their insecurities and manipulates them to make sure they only do and say things the leader wants. Otherwise, they are very efficient on getting rid of people who do not “please” the leader one way or another.

HR is kind but plays the therapist role rather than a facilitator. At least 25 people in our department have talked with HR. All we’ve heard is “Awww” and “it’ll get better, we will coach them” for the last 6 months. Can’t say we haven’t tried. We can’t all switch teams and ultimately it is the company’s responsibility to weed out bad leaders. It is not just people suffering (though of course Salesforce will say people are important) but business is suffering because we have a whole department that is wasting money, talent and resources - and no amount of escalation has yielded anything.","Why would I care about the company rating and culture if my department sucks and my daily work is worthless? It is irrelevant how awesome the C-suite is, if their direct report is a tyrant with bad people skills and faulty decision making methodologies that prioritize pandering over value creation. Unless individual bad leaders can be held accountable to the feedback they receive, this company’s culture is ready to start sinking rapidly. Our team already feels it.",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Management (at least in sales) only manages by the numbers, with no EQ to speak of, shuns 2-way dialogue, and pushes everything on the front line. They don't prioritize their requests and overwhelm their teams, who are trying to close business and/or appease unhappy customers. Meanwhile, there's zero knowledge management to speak of -- we are literally incessantly filling out shared docs with the same information multiple times outside of the CRM. and everyone on the account team loses the plot. Who would have thunk?

Salesforce is cost cutting in an effort to reach profitability. Goodbye parties, offsites, and non customer-facing travel. Benefits aren't cheap -- I'm paying well over $400/mo. for mine.

It's been observed that they are systematically pushing workers 40+ out of the business to hire less experienced / new grads for less -- a ""best practice"" of private equity companies that seems to be catching on like wildfire in tech.

Last but not least, at a company that espouses the values that it does, I am surprised that so many offsite events and outings include a ridiculous amount of drinking. Not ONCE has our team done a group volunteering outing or something to serve our community (and I'm at HQ in San Francisco).

This isn't an expectation - it's simply about owning your responsibilities required to do a good job for our customers.

In the past, logging honest hours hasn't been an issue - AE's logged hours according to the work put in. This year however, it is ""48 hours or less...if you are logging more than 50 hours, you're not efficient"" .... This is concerning b/c it represents a subtle undertone of apathy to AE's. We were recruited under the notion we would be allowed to log the hours we worked. If the company is moving away from paying hourly, then the salaries should adjust accordingly - b/c this was the #1 negotiation tactic used by Salesforce recruiters to lowball base salaries.

The matrix meats the hunger games...nothing is as it seems and everyone is out for you. From development to a closing role, no increase in base. “We should be lucky to be getting what we get” - actual words from an internal recruiter. Internal employees are the least paid and get less 1:1 time bc we already “know what we are doing.” If a recruiter isn’t being paid, our ramp time is smaller, wouldn’t it make sense to give us a pay increase as we climb the rungs of the company AND fight our way amongst top talent to do so? I’ve seen too many friends and colleagues be told no or strung along for too long. For a transparent company, it’s not always so transparent. Every year after fiscal end there are massive changes that are made and then take months to implement (comp structures, territories, complete .org restructures).
The acquisitions, while they are great choices and make our platform whole, have been a point of struggle bc acquiring a company that has operated one way for so long and folding it in to one of the biggest technology companies globally isn’t an easy feat and there are a lot of areas that seem to be overlooked.

I've told my story unbiased to several other managers and co-workers, and they ALL agree that I was really given a raw deal. I was never given any solid opportunities to sharpen my Marketing Cloud skill-set, and the opportunities I was given (working on Accelerators) I excelled at. Every feedback received from customers (via Accelerators) and co-workers alike was nothing less than extraordinary. However, none of this mattered for some reason. I've kept a document that noted every piece of feedback received just in case I had to have something to back my story up with. I feel, along with others, that my manager had a personal vendetta against me and was working to get me dismissed. I was never given opportunities to work on real Marketing Cloud projects therefore, couldn't really get some good feedback going from that perspective. I was given the bare minimum to work with and often, I was left without work to do. In the end, I got tired of this treatment and began looking for other opportunities that really valued what I brought to the table.

Sure, they can purchase stock through the ESPP, but that means they have to still pay out of pocket for something that other employees are given.

Love the fact that we are now leading with a culture that I see other brands are taking now, from our 1-1-1 model to no PTO policy to the amazing health/well-being offerings that I see daily in my corporate communications.

Your peers are amazing, talented and more than willing to help out. It a nice inner-network that you can build upon and start to develop long-standing relationships for years to come.

Office environments are really nice and WFH opportunities are life-changing. Just be prepared to know what that means - some people need people around them at all times and some excel in a virtual environment.

The clients are always happy to see a Salesforce employee (very different from my experience with the other ""big 3""), but I also know that the ""army"" does still tend to show up at executive meetings that is not necessary.

Pay and benefits are good and hard to match with our competitors.","""Go faster and better...and when you get there, go even faster and do more than you did last time"" seems to be the endless cycle of trying to hit our numbers as an organization and I am seeing a lot of my colleagues burn out. This is across sales, engineering, product as well as marketing. So for many in different areas, your work/life balance may be different than say those in other departments (be aware of this when/if you are interviewing).

There is a real issue that I know is being looked at now (end of 2018) around helping all employees with their career pathing (which is non-existent in my team) and is starting to lead to team members looking at other opportunities (inside and outside) in order to grow. You hear things like ""own your career"" but honestly, this is such a jab at people who are really trying to embody this and not getting what they need (whether performance feedback, career plan, opportunities to grow) from management. I am not sure how much longer this can go on until management starts to focus on this more and not just a passing comment like above. Its scary when you have new employees come into the brand and ask me ""so how do you move up at Salesforce?"" The organization does not have an answer for this, but I know is trying to solve for this.

To professionals who are looking to get foot in the door - our recruitment process is not the best. Have sent several personal friends into the interview process and hard to hear the negativity with their experience from such a good company. Decisions are made by hiring manager and feedback from teams that you would interview for, but there are small pockets of ""personal friends"" of managers who will get beneficial treatment that I do not like to see (its obvious)...but I would say that if you are trying to get into Salesforce, think about other roles that you can look at just to get into the organization. Sometimes having a second choice will ultimately present you as a more diverse expert and one that you can easily switch internally to that job you originally wanted.","Please continue to make progress around career planning and employee retention. You have seen the recent survey results - its telling (again). I know we as an organization can solve for this and be more clearer between employee and management. Some managers just simply do not embrace this as much and that is where I see the cancer that needs to be deracinated quickly.

Continue to create and leverage 'voice of the employee' as swat teams to help solve for the issues that continue to fester within our organization that is leading to burnout, mental well-being and people looking to explore other options in order to grow. Salesforce needs to be stronger in a true partnership between employee and growth we will be future industry leaders and there is opportunity here for Salesforce to make that kind of impact that you do not see at Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. Its right there now for the taking.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

It was my dream company to work for, mainly because of the culture. Beyond the in-house perks, there’s the 56 hours a year we are given to volunteer and give back in pretty much anyway you see fit. The benefits are superior to any company I’ve worked for. The buildings are a pleasure to work in each day. They focus on wellness and striking a good work-life balance. And in all earnesty, want to, and do give back to our communities.","Unfortunately, all of the above is not available across the board. My manager has, short of explicitly saying it, told us we can only volunteer 15 hours a year, to create only one career development goal, “he doesn’t care what it is”, rolls his eyes at the thought of us taking advantage of the company’s championed cause of meditation, told us we aren’t allowed to take ANY time off for a six month period every single year. And to top it off, he’s the biggest micromanager I have ever worked for in my career. You better be the first one there, and last to leave, finishing work at home doesn’t “count”. And not once, has he ever complimented or commended any of us. Doctor appointment? Have a family commitment during the week? Better not make a habit of it. God forbid you have something going on that requires frequent doctor visits. If we want to grow our skill sets via Trailhead, better do it after hours or on the weekend.

Mind you, I talk to other people in the company and they are appalled that this is happening. My ratings are based on my specific experience, and do not represent the typical Salesforce experience.

I thought it was just him, and some of it certainly is, but the whole department is toxic. There’s turnover left and right, every couple of weeks it seems another coworker chooses to leave the company. And if the VP cared, they would do something. It’s blatant. I have thought of raising the issue to HR but it’s obvious these people have been here a long time, and make someone above them happy, so it’s pointless.","Look at the data. Where do you see the highest turnover (not counting sales) and look into why that is.

Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts. They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system.

I had a 1.1 million dollar quota for a territory that made $200,000 TOTAL the year before. You tell me how that adds up?! On top of that, I was putting in 11-12 hour work days (which is encouraged, might I add) and only making 3% commission on every deal I closed even though I grew my little territory over 80%. You make no money here, you are not compensated fairly and when brought up to management they sweep it under the rug and deflect. Management and leadership plays favorites and gives larger,
More tech savvy territories to AEs who are not skilled but rather, who they party with. Yet we all have the same quotas (unless you actually have a lower quota bc you’re a favorite too).",This place is a total boys club. I’ve seen 3 men in very high up leadership positons get fired because they were having extra marital affairs with employees.
