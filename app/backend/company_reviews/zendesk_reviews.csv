The environment is generally collaborative without a lot of bureaucracy getting in the way of new ideas. Most employees are approachable and transparent and genuinely want to help each other succeed.

I love our global structure because I get to work and exchange ideas with coworkers all over the world and sometimes travel to collaborate in person. These connections across cultures have contributed greatly to my professional and personal growth.

Our benefits are excellent and our office spaces are beautiful and well taken care of. Learning & development is promoted on an individual and team level. Our events and holiday parties are really fun without being ostentatious.

I have amazing work/life balance; It's a real value here, not just lip service. I work 45 hours per week on average and my productivity is higher than jobs where I worked 60+ because I love what I do.","Working in the Tenderloin is very stressful. As some employees have mentioned, voicing that you don't like coming here every day is dismissed by many as an insult to our neighbors. I reject that leap; I care a lot about the people who live here and I volunteer with and donate to local organizations. I also avoid coming into work because I do not feel safe. I've personally been grabbed by a stranger, stepped on used needles, heard gunshots, and seen several acts of violence- all within a few feet of our offices. We live in a city and I accept some level of risk and danger, but this is too much.","Please take SF employees' safety concerns seriously and move the office to a safer neighborhood. We don't need to work in the Tenderloin to volunteer here and support local orgs.

Consolidate to one building in SF. Meetings rarely (if ever) start on time because someone is always running late from another building.

Continue to build on our Learning & Development offerings, including a lot more management training. Also offer training on specific skills. Survey the employees to find out what they need to learn to be successful.

Allow a reasonable amount of global travel. When employees build strong relationships with their peers in other countries it contributes immensely to the quality of work and productivity. You just can't make the same kind of connections over a Zoom call.

HR protects the company: Bring up issues about your manager and they'll either forward them to the manager themselves or ignore them. Usually they did the former.

Managers have total power: If your manager doesn't like you, you're not going to last at the company. They have total discretion to determine who gets to do what, and will assign you no work, then criticize you for doing no work.

Finally, while the non-engineering onboarding was comprehensive, the engineering onboarding was virtually nonexistent.","Treat the employees who arent managers with some respect. They work there too.

- Leadership team is very approachable
- Business is going strong, possibly due to a really strong sales team. Stock price keeps breaking record high all the time in the past couple months!
- Pretty good brand recognition. Customers are actually loving the product! I think it’s still pretty cool to have random people saying “Oh you’re working for Zendesk? I love you guys’ product, it helps my small business a lot!!”
- Global company, quite a good chance you’ll get to travel to see other offices around the world when you reach certain seniority level
- The standard Silicon Valley company’s perks: commuter benefits, snacks, 401k, health insurance, all the usual stuffs","- Especially in Engineering org, feels like there is zero accountability and no rewards. I’m not talking about punishing people for mistakes but you still have to have some sort of accountability. Projects can go on forever and people get stuck in one project for months if not years. At the same time, people who deliver good job are simply not rewarded.
- The classic “if everyone owns it, nobody owns it”.
- Lots of growing pains. People start to introduce processes, middle management, bogus KPI or goals, cost cutting exercise, etc.
- No clear direction for career advancement. It works really well if you’re already at Staff or Architect level but if you’re a junior trying to climb up the career ladder, it’s close to non existent.
- Total compensation seems to be much lower than industry standard, especially in Silicon Valley where a 10 people in-garage based startup is valued at some billion dollars and able to throw money to attract the best talents.
- I will repeat other reviews about office location. It can be daunting to go to work in such an environment every day. Again, this is not being ignorant to the real issue there but there is this mental stress you accrue subconsciously that will affect you. Some people can’t take it anymore, others manage to ignore it. Zendesk representative will probably respond to this message by saying that Zendesk is “committed” to work to improve the area but in my opinion there are various other way to still get involved and not making the location the office where all employees should go to",Really open your ears and listen to your employees.

2018-04-28,,,Former Employee ,Data,More than 3 years,0,There have been some amazing hires as of late at Zendesk who are lifting Zendesk up into the space it wants to be in. Specifically the CIO who's been fantastic thus far. There's also much hope and optimism about the company's future and a general consensus feeling that the company is currently in a good place. Business is all good.,"Zendesk's core company values are a complete facade. Many of the people who formed it's once 'humble' culture have now departed and have been replaced by a very mid to senior level hierarchy. I can't count how many VP's and Directors have been hired in the past 2 years but they all report into maybe 3-4 people which creates a ton of friction because of the lack of communication and egos this structure has created.

I echo many of the reviews on here that favoritism is a huge problem at Zendesk which is preventing the company from becoming more modern and data driven. A rat pack group sits atop the social pyramid at Zendesk who have been there since the early days and who are too comfortable to move. They use antiquated data tools and are failing to adapt to a more data driven culture. As a result, no resources are given to many of the technical analytic groups because they've gotten to where they are going on gut, not data. It frustrates analysts across departments because they do not know how their product is performing and can't make informed business decisions.

Finally, Neighborhood wise, the Tenderloin wears on you over time. In ways I felt it affected my job performance because on bad days I refused to leave the building for a walk and couldn't stride into work without having some level of anxiety because of the conditions. This is not to say that Zendesk is not empathetic to the neighborhood, but rather the conditions accentuate the stress in the work environment.","Take a minute to evaluate your company structure and determine if expanding the mid-level leadership who have the vision but not the current technical skills is what will keep Zendesk successful. Many ideas, not enough execution. Intentions are good but unrealistic given the resources.

Get out of your comfort zone and recognize that problems exist within the product and data organizations. If Zendesk wants to expand and retain its stock price, it needs to put more investment into it's data infrastructure beyond what it has done so far. It is still a mess to wrangle with even with some reorganization.",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

-For the most part great people to work with.
-Not too big of a company but not too small. Good work environment.
-Always growing and leadership is transparent with information.
-They listen to employees and try to do better for the most part.","Neighborhood is very interesting to say the least. I understand there is a $120 parking benefit for Zendesk and I appreciate that. However, the Tenderloin is probably not the best place for a growing company. This is something employees cannot control and I know it is a huge negative about Zendesk. There is no way to sugar coat this.

Many employees that were here in the early stages of Zendesk are gone or pushed out. (Talking about employees that started before 2016). In order to survive at Zendesk, favoritism was something you better hope your management has for you. There was a recent hire where a Sr director decided to just build a team with people who use to work for her. This ultimately created a separation from the longer tenured employees and a huge level of favoritism.

The level of favoritism at Zendesk made it hard for my team to stay motivated and work harder. In my opinion, this has to be addressed. I understand there are people you prefer to work with, but it got to a point where if you didn't agree with the direction the team is heading towards. You will be placed in their cross hairs. I also understand change is something that is hard to adapt to. However, if employees in your team are unhappy and leaving one by one. I don't have much to say. That in itself is a red flag.","I appreciate all the things management has done such as 401k match. 401k match was something that was not around until late 2017. Employees kept asking for it and they delivered. Although the 401k was not a lot, it just shows that management were willing to listen.

Favoritism has to be addressed. If you want people to work harder and be loyal to Zendesk. Leadership needs to realize a simple concept taught in elementary school. Treat others how you want to be treated.",4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

In that vein there is a strong respect for family and work life balance relative to other tech companies in the bay area. While it varies by group working hours in the office typically start at between 9-10am. And most people leave between 5-6pm so there are very few folks around past 6:00pm. Compensation is generally lower than at other tech firms. But it is probably fair given the number of hours worked.","CHALLENGES MOVING UP MARKET
The company is going through a challenging transition as it moves from its early success being a help desk software platform for startups and smaller businesses to one that is now focused on moving up market and selling customer service software to larger more established businesses. Zendesk has promised Wall Street that it will achieve $1B in revenue by 2020. This is an aggressive goal that has put a lot of short term stress on the business (and correspondingly its employees) each quarter as it figures out how to live up to the promise.

To achieve $1B in my mind means fully committing to moving up market and selling to enterprise buyers. This has been hard for the company as it is requires the company to be the type of business that the original Zendesk was trying to disrupt. As Mikkel the CEO writes in his book Startupland ""we shared a healthy disdain for the traditional enterprise software sales model. The big platforms, the expensive salespeople with the expense accounts, the semireligious conferences, the PowerPoint software, the locked-in relationships"".

This move up market requires that requires the company to change a lot of what made it successful early on. The company needs to build new muscles in sales and marketing to support enterprise which requires new skills, new processes, and often times new people. This has resulted in multiple reorganizations (or ""evolutions"" as they are now calling them) in sales and marketing that have been fairly disruptive and caused a lot of angst for people in terms of having clear roles and responsibilities.

LACK OF URGENCY
The work life balance mentioned as a pro also means that the company does not move as quickly as other places. And as a result there is not a lot of ""urgency"" within the company to get stuff done quickly. This can be frustrating for those who do have urgency and are trying to push others to have the same mindset.

NOT A DATA/ANALYTICS CULTURE
The company has historically not been one that relied significantly on data/metrics to make decisions. It's always done things by the seat of its pants and is not particularly buttoned up. As a result there is not a strong data/analytics culture within the company and the corresponding data/analytics infrastructure including reporting and systems reflects that. So often the data required to make decisions is not available, incomplete, or simply inaccurate.
The company is trying to change this but it requires a lot of work to undo years of neglect. So for folks that want to have reliable data to make decisions Zendesk may not be the best fit.

DIVERSITY & CAREER ADVANCEMENT
While the company has initiatives around diversity the company is still not very diverse at the senior and mid level management positions and there seems to be a bias for younger employees. This seems to be ingrained into the companies recruiting culture. In fact two of its most senior and long tenured minority Vice Presidents just announced their departure October 2017. The company does have a history of promoting young employees who are willing to work hard and go the extra mile. There are at least 3 VPs that have been promoted in the last year that are under 30. Many of the older senior leaders are being pushed out.","Wall Street certainly rewards growth and setting an aggressive goal of $1B in revenue is to be commended. However, it also necessitates focusing on short term revenue goals which when you are trying to shift the business is challenging. I'd encourage management to think more about the long term strategy and providing enough air cover and protection to allow employees to invest in initiatives that will fuel the future growth of Zendesk.",2.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

--Management is very self-aware, and has good judgment especially with regard to fostering a good employee experience and marketing.","--Roles were not always well-defined, especially in Ops. Probably some cultural vestiges left over from the startup days.
--Zendesk is lacking ( a bit) in technical talent from top to bottom. Its a Ruby-on-Rails shop at heart, trying to move into big data, machine learning, and more. But could any c-level exec (besides Mikkel) even log on to a server?
--The company is almost comically non-aggressive. Bold projects or risk-taking technologies are not emphasized as much as donating time to take an elderly resident on a bike ride through the Tenderloin (then capturing 50 photos for social media). Employees can veer awfully close to Millennial caricatures. Kind of a wimpy environment. This is not a bad thing, but in the absence of a corresponding 'work-hard, play-hard' ethic - it can feel frivolous.",Hold your C-level execs accountable and replace them if they don't deliver.

- World class creative design team. Terrific internal and external branding.
- Nice office and event space that exhibits Danish design elements
- Great weekly happy hours, lunch & learn sessions.","- Culture: There is no common DNA that binds the company culturally. The company has to emphasize on core values and have people in all levels of the organization “walk the walk”.
- Rampant cronyism/favoritism. If you are friends with the Sheriff, you can get away with anything in this town.
- ""Flash"" gets rewarded over substance
- Lack of transparency in senior leadership. Financial and headcount planning exercise lacks discipline and long term thinking.
- Engineering is treated as a disposable “resource” and full time employees get treated more like contractors.
- Product management dictates what gets done without necessarily doing due diligence. Most things are done by a product manager’s “gut” feel without the corresponding responsibility. Non-technical PMs trying to run engineering teams makes things double worse.
- The operations engineering organization is an absolute nightmare. Things take forever to get done and any efforts to fix this has not been effective.
- The company lacks long term strategic thinking and tends to follow industry leaders without being thought leaders.
- There has been a lot of attrition in the company in the past six months. There have been at least 10 people at the senior management level (VP+) who have left the company along with several tenured employees.
- The company was great a few years ago but is just not making the leap to the next level. Things have become extremely political, especially at the top.

• Attention paid for healthy work-family-life balance
• Nice snack options
• Access to a wide variety of technologies
• Back in the day, the 'chill factor' was great but high tension now","• Passive-Aggressive leadership
• No commitment to seasoned employees
• No follow-up or accountability on negative performance reviews, if they're one of the 'cool kids' - particularly, if they the 'cool kid' is in management
• High turnover and some aloof, ineffective managers that leave their team in disarray
• High turnover has encouraged sloppy hiring of people who name-drop and speak only in industry buzzwords with little comprehension or deep technical ability; narcissists are superb at charisma and conning, working their way up the social ladder
• Younger arrogant managers talking down to seasoned engineers and colleagues causing friction and lack of trust between teams and employees
• Huge attrition rates and technical debt with loss of great colleagues, now that we've gone public (IPO)
• Non-comparable pay for Silicon Valley, despite experience level and ability; high pay goes to the 'cool kids' with the 'flashy outfits' and ""friends"" in high places
• Candid but respectful voicing of concerns can either fall on deaf ears or receives secretive retribution towards the employee who brought up the issue; walking on eggshells has become a common theme behind the scenes
• Tribalism: certain groups receive all the goodies, attention and perks, while others are ignored; cliques are easily formed similar to high school or college
• Neighborhood environs are quite depressing and disturbing; they don't contribute to a positive start of the day, especially when I've had to witness shootings, stabbings, overdoses, public defecation, robbery and physical assaults - including of myself and my colleagues - just walking to and from work. When colleagues have brought up physical assaults and abuse they've received in the neighborhood, ""Community Outreach"" and upper management has downplayed their concerns and told them ""maybe they should be more considerate of people in need"" and ""take a walking tour to better get to know the neighborhood"" - they assume the worst of the person and negatively attack their character as non-charitable person. Of course, these same people don't live in the neighborhood, some don't even live in the city, are quick to dismiss employees fears and valid safety concerns, in the name of political correctness. Why do honest people need to be attacked?","My advice to management is:

• to do more to keep and attract great quality employees and avoid falling into frat-boy style hiring tactics. Don't be fooled by loquaciousness and flashy titles. Make sure the 'cool kid' actually has substance and expertise in what they claim to be an expert in.

• Consider offering raises and/or bonuses for long-time employees who've put in the work, passion and loyalty to the company and their fellow team members.

• Don't allow resources to be gobbled up by some teams over others just because they're the popular and powerful. It creates an unbalanced and unfair work enviornment when some teams don't have the funds to complete training or beneficial off-sites because no one thought of them.

• Improve office security so that no more equipment, like laptops, or personal effects, like purses or wallets, are stolen.",2.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Enthusiastic staff - while workloads can be daunting, getting things done correctly is first and foremost on everyone's mind. The overall vibe is very team-centric.

Onboarding is a snap - I've had everything necessary to do my job since my first day in the office. This includes hardware (workstation and peripherals), software (operational applications, task-specific applications), security (right-sized access to data/tools) and mentoring (vast team knowledge and a role-related ""buddy"" to answer any questions). New hires need to get up to speed quickly, and this enables it.

Freedom to work where you are comfortable. Prefer a booth or a couch over sitting at your desk? No problem - there are plenty of different types of spots to settle in to get work done. Use of technology to meet also bridges communication gaps that are typically present in companies with teams that are literally based around the world.

Reduced overhead. Need a mouse? Get one. There's no need for a 5-day turnaround with requisitioning something that'd cost less than the time it would take to request it. Employees are enabled to make decisions and get things done that are in the best interest of the organization.","There is much work to be done - if you aren't accustomed to a fast-paced, constantly-changing environment, this can be exasperating. Fortunately, management has acknowledged this is and is in the process of right-sizing the organization for the workload.

Some people may be challenged by the open-concept office layout - if you come from a land of white noise and cubicle farms, there are plenty of audio and visual distractions to deal with.

- Incredible focus on corporate social responsibility all over the globe

- Very flat organization where management is receptive to new ideas and methods","-Career progression opportunities are ill-defined and opaque in many departments.

- Not necessarily a con for everyone but rapid growth means you might be doing one thing one day and then told to stop doing it and focus on something else the next.

People first, or more accurately the right people first: meaning that doing whats best for the customer/employee/community takes precedent over doing what will benefit the share-holders. The idea here that by doing the right thing, in as many aspects as possible, the company will benefit as a byproduct. Not only is this an idea that resonates with me personally, with today's increasingly socially-minded consumers, it will likely continue to resonate with the market.

I know I am not alone in saying, that ""Zendesk Family"" (this includes our customers too!) feel less like job/business and more of a culture or a literal family, and on that you would willingly try your best to see do well.

Plenty of opportunity. Plenty of truly good people. Couldn't be happier building my career here","When I started there, it was like a person in that awkward ""transition period"" before being able act, and feel, like an adult. Almost like the freshman sports star that realized the talent alone that got them there would not be enough to keep having the success they have grown to expect. It would take being smarter. Better processes. More leadership.

While I have seen a dramatic (it's crazy really) improvement in this regard, they know that improvements can always be made.

Because of this, if you are not good at adapting to an ever-changing environment, or willing to try something new, possibly just to scrap it just as you started getting used to doing so, you may not like Zendesk.","I recognize managements stellar job of proving that we will not remain ""that great start-up"" or ""the first choice for small businesses, but not viable for larger companies needs"". We have proven to be able to adapt to being a true organization, and not a scrappy team with a great product. Even more so when it comes to proving to the market that the solution is more times than not, the best option for business of all sizes (Happy to go toe-to-toe with any of the alternatives, the whole lot of em').

But my only request now is to not let the ""soul"" of Zendesk get lost in the progression. You can't force ""cool"" or ""caring"", but do not foster an environment promotes otherwise. If I have to someday where a tie everyday, or not do whats right for the customers in the name of the almighty dollar.

-The office is a fantastic space with gorgeous views. The in-office perks are pretty fantastic

-As long as you're doing your job, you can pretty much coast by and do a so-so job and still get somewhere in the company (get a raise/promoted/bonus).

-It's a relatively young office; so co-workers are always open to getting drinks after work.","Where do I start:
-There is not a standard set of expectations for employees company-wide. Employees who work in larger departments need to work harder to shine; while those in smaller departments who are absolutely terrible at their job can either get promoted/raises/bonuses pretty easily.

-Employees can do a terribly at their job, and still get promoted due to a lack of applicants/talent for jobs. The same can be said for people in their position a prolonged period of time. I'm not saying this is the case for all employees, but it really degrades the title of your position. My advice to anyone going into support is to do your time, get to know the hiring managers in other departments, tailor your time in support to where you want to end up, and get out of support as soon as you can.

-There is no pay scale implemented at all. Team leads can sometimes make less than those on their teams; there no standardization when it comes to pay. There can be an alarming gap between employees who hold the same title. Some employees with a job title that is in a tier below another can make the same, if not more than an employee in a higher tier of the same department. You're better off not telling anyone what you make, or asking what others make (because good luck getting that pay bump).

-There's definitely a considerable amount of politicking that goes on in the background, and it doesn't help the employees at all. The company could use a little more transparency rather than sugar-coating unpleasant news.

-It's a relatively young office; so some questionable decisions are bound to be made.","Keep doing what you're doing if you want to become the next Epic. You're not working people to death by any means; but the mental stress that goes into putting up with your ""initiatives"" is something else.

CEO cares so deeply about customers, community and employees as opposed to his own ego or riches. Laughter and joy are the most common emotions expressed.

Customers LOVE LOVE LOVE Zendesk, even if our product (and people) aren't perfect. When a customer tells us they are leaving for a competitor, we actually help them do it, and treat them with respect and care on their way out. And they often come back when they realize they'be been duped.

Nobody in the company is satisfied with any aspect of the product, company, design or culture. This gives us all a sense of ""kaizen"" (continuous improvement) which is very healthy. Plus the Zen thing is more than a fat Buddha on the website, it's weirdly (and appropriately) weaved throughout our culture.

And I get to say curse words all the time and people don't get uncomfortable. The ""old timers"" who were there at the beginning are very welcoming of newer people which is rare.

I could go on and on....","Just typical fast-growing startup stuff. Growing fast has meant some mediocre hires in key roles which can breed more mediocrity.

Our people are curious and keen to learn and grow. This is why I truly love and see myself remaining indefinitely at Zendesk.

The other stuff, like perks, conditions and environment are second to none, but these hold nothing against the quality of our people and leaders.

Put it this way. Every Sunday night I have a serious TGIM moment. I genuinely look forward to kicking off every new week. No TGIF here.","Note: the following statement is not really a con...

I am in a highly specialised role, and a solo operator in my region, so whilst the traditional opportunities for progression may not be as plentiful as they would be in a huge conglomerate, I have numerous other opportunities.

The wonderful trade-off is that I get to progress my career in an environment that encourages risk-taking and innovation. All that stuff I wanted to try in my last jobs, I get to play with and try at Zendesk.

So whilst I might not be fast labelled with a lofty, ego-stroking title, I am given endless opportunities to experiment and explore and have a real impact on the people I work with every day.","You're doing an awesome job.

Bootcamp is of very high standard
Some really nice and friendly individuals","Terrible middle management for the most part, in particular at VP and DIrector level : old school techniques not aligned with Zendesk's startup spirit.
Turnover at management level translated into very little coaching and guidance .
Completely unrealistic sales target with a blanket approach for the whole team regardless of what territory you work on, your level of senority and so on.
Territories are constantly changing (every quarter), which makes it very difficult to build long term relationships with clients and prospects.
The picture painted during my interviews and the reality were quite different.
Cliquey atmosphere that does not come across as being very real
I personally did not like the offices, which are right next to the Crossrail building site, in a not so desirable area of Paddington.
It's common for probation periods to last up to a year, which is just not right in my opinion. If you've hired someone, you should be able to tell if they are right for the job in the first 6 months.","Treat your sales people with more respect. Don't ignore them when you see them in the corridor ! Take an interest in what they do. As a sales manager, it's your job to motivate your troops, and it's's a daily job, not a once in a quarter effort. Tailor your salespeople's objectives to their territories and book of business.

- Company goals are very clear and well known by any employees. All top level goals are then translated to meaningful goals for your team.&nbsp;It helps to stay focus and have a correct global vision.
- Zendesk is paying a lot of attention and money in the recruiting process. Having many people involved in a recruitment process helps to identify the right person for the right job. It's very common to be in the recruiting process for one person that could become your peer in the next months. So your voice will be heard, and it helps to build trust, right from the start.","- Zendesk is growing fast, so it's hard sometimes to keep up the pace.

As part of the recruitment team, I've been blown away by the way that Zendesk as a company approaches hiring. It feels like management is truly engaged with the process as partners, with recruitment/PeopleOps viewed as critical to growing the company and not as a cost cutting exercise (as it often is viewed at other organisations).

As a candidate, the time and care put into the process of joining Zendesk is just the start of how well you will be treated as an employee here.","As with all rapidly scaling companies, there is some ambiguity in how we get things done.

-Communication between departments almost absent, you need to open a ticket or use the internal chat, but no-one coordinate departments at a higher level.

2016-12-17, Technical Launch Manager,Singapore (Singapore),Current Employee ,One Implementation Specialist's View of Zendesk,More than 3 years,0,"Zendesk provides a great environment for self-fulfillment and improvement. There are many opportunities and it is relatively open to exploring my interests even if they fall outside of my specific role. For example, I am passionate about learning foreign languages and as a company that has clientele around the globe, there are many conversations in non-English languages. I've been successful at getting myself into many of those conversations even though I was not directly hired for it. Zendesk also has an inclusive and welcoming environment. I have worked at the office in Madison and in Singapore and both have felt this way. The company organizes many events and is inclusive of all employees to participate. There is also an awesome feeling of empowerment both on the job and in the larger community. CSR is an important part of our job and even though I don't participate as much as others, it feels great to see our CEO so active. Lastly, it is open in terms of rank and file employees approaching management or senior management to express concerns or to socialize.","As a new company, many policies and procedures are not clearly defined, frequently change, or are simply not good. I think that as it is raplidly growing there is also constant change, which can be good for the opportunity it provides, but also bad as the structure can often be insufficient. There is also a lot of change as Zendesk continues transitioning away from start-up mentality (1600+ employees) to more corporate: more bureaucracy, more inflexible policies, more segmentation and siloing of responsibilities. Though these can be good things in ways, they can also be very negative for one seeking the openness and flexibility of startup.","Work on providing more clearly defined structure to employees so they can be more certain about their position, their responsibilities, limitations and extent of duties, and company policies so that they can focus on doing awesome things. Also, don't lose the charm of the lean Danish start-up that has made Zendesk so attractive.",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Globally
=====

Well like any American company the head office Americans have all the fun. Everywhere else is neglected unless we have a visitor then its all smiles and positive PR. This may explain the mixed reviews and gushing. If it is a gushing review its likely a San fran employee.

Also there is a lot of politics and ""who you know"" culture.

It is plain to see this is a start up trying to grow up. The problem is that they have lots of staff managing who are now out of their depth. They seem to be in a bubble of their own hype and self importance and no one seems to do anything to fix it.

I have seen several high profile comings and goings (CTO level downward) and it is all spun with happy happy joy joy PR (as most things are with Zendesk). The dark truth of some of these departures is worrying particularly the way employees are fired. Never seen anything like it and I question the legality in some cases as there is still no HR handbook or in fact a proper HR structure.

I have also seen some unbelievably talented employees throw in the towel after a number of years, being pushed out by those I began describing in lower management.

It really is all about who you know and that couldn't be more evident than at Zendesk.

UK specific
=====

In support team meetings and personal 1-1 reviews are often ignored / cancelled. Great for morale of the team. Points raised in meetings are often ignored only to be brought up several weeks later as either a managers idea or something that an American suggested on one of the infinite number of meetings that seem to have no point or purpose.

Morale is very low and has been for some time. There is no bonus culture here and the pay is poor. Any rise if you get one is 3% which translates to about £40 extra a month after tax.

I could go on to be honest but my advice if you are thinking about joining this company in the UK is go in prepared for disappointment and keep your eyes open to other opportunities elsewhere. There are certainly better paying gigs in London with a similar vibe.

If you want a career don't join this company. They have a small marketing dept, a big sales dept with unrealistic targets, a small services team that hires externally (their own dev friends) and a support team that is very understaffed and has been for a number of years. If you need it spelled out there is nowhere for you to move into to further your career and that's not going to change as Dublin is their Euro HQ. London is a sales hub.","Get rid of managers who are not capable at growing teams to match business requirements.

Stop ignoring failure of managers

Increase wages

Insist that 1-1 meetings and salary reviews actually take place

Give people bonuses

Give more opportunities and clear out the mouthpieces fond of their own voice and self praise wrapped up in their own hype",2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0
