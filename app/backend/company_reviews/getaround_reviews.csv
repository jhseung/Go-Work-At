People here strike a good balance of professionalism and collaboration. I see people tapping one another on the shoulder for conversation constantly, across functions and levels of experience.
- They've figured out (and now push the frontiers of) a really interesting and complex business. Renting a cars peer-to-peer & in the real world is a challenging two-sided marketplace like Airbnb's (with some interesting differences I won't get into here).
- Meaty technical challenges across consumer experiences (iOS, Android, Web), scaled/distributed infrastructure (services powering e.g. search & device telemetry run in containers on GKE), and the custom IoT device embedded in cars ( firmware and hardware)
- Users have validated that the product makes sense
- Investors have validated that Getaround's business makes sense
- Getaround's mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere. This directly results in less need for cars, which makes cities better and reduces emissions (dramatically). If you care about these things, know that the central profit engine at Getaround directly aligns with making the world better. This is one of those rare companies where this impact is for real.","- Gaps in HR ability. E.g. people don't have clearly-documented paths for advancement in each role.
- The company needs some more leadership capability. It only just hired a VP Marketing, and sorely needs a VP People (to address some of the items above)
- While the mission is clear, particular projects that Getaround pursues are head- scratchers
- Overwork is episodic, and has generally become much more stable as the company hires stronger managers. But there are a couple teams that get hit more often.","- Take care of your people. You've increased perks and compensation across the board, and that's been really welcome. But all the other initiatives that a VP of People would pursue shouldn't be on hold.
- Articulate a clearer strategy for the company. It should be a way to apply core strength of ours to a key opportunity in a way that others are ignoring or will have trouble copying. Getaround's strategy should be obvious when we hear it, and it should align everyone in a focused effort.

The company culture is horrible, and there is NO work-life balance. Be prepared to get pinged by management nights, weekends, holidays and don’t ever take any unplanned leave for emergencies. The C-level management is unprofessional and has no shame in sending employees a nasty message via flowdock aka slack. The CFO thinks he should be the CEO and the CEO could care less about the people.

When Executives are asked questions by employees during meetings where questions are encouraged the answers are dodged, dishonest, or just bad. They tell employees what they want them to hear so as not to get more attrition.

The company has been around since 2007 and can't even get a sign outside of their office that says Getaround. (pathetic)

2015-03-20, Claims/Safety Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,A place to grow.,More than 3 years,0,"When I started at Getaround, I was fresh out of college with no experience in tech or the working world. I had always been passionate about cars (I thumbed through AutoTrader often), but I didn't know yet how much value I would get (and continue to receive) when I started working here. Getaround became, for me, a place where I would go on to get a real, valuable education. It is a fast paced, creative, and inspiring environment. I have been constantly challenged and asked to attack new issues that are vital to the company.

As I matured in my role, I have been able to advance in my career. In the time I've spent at Getaround, I have gone from a intern handling odds and ends to a Claims/Safety Manager handling major cases, drafting important policy/process, and have had the opportunities to grow my skills as a manager and leader. I am not a stand alone example of this either.

Transportation is a true pillar of the modern society. Getaround is solving that problem. It's motivating to know the actions you are taking everyday are going to really disrupt the world as we know it. This is a vision that is shared by the whole team especially in leadership.

The leadership team at Getaround is very invested in the vision of the company. No job is too small to get this idea across the finish line. When our support team needed help for several months, every single member of the founding team was on the front lines taking support calls at night and over the weekends.

On weekends and late at night, you can always find a member of the leadership team online or at the office working on this or that initiative. Though Getaround has been around for 5 years, the pace, dedication and ferocity of a start up trying to really have an impact on the world has not left any part of the leadership team which has translated to the rest of the organization as a whole.

Getaround for me is a family. Like all families, there are times of strife, stress, and hardship; however, there is no one else you'd rather face those adversities with. The people are dedicated and deliberate, eager to change the way the world uses cars.","Like all start ups, there is room for growth.

Cross team coordination is still being perfected, and it can be frustrating at times. Leadership has started to combat this by identifying key hires in important areas of the organization to increase the level of communication across teams.

Perfect can become the enemy of good. At times, I feel like the perfect solution may be out of scope, and a practical solution may exist that isn't as involved and may be a better path forward. There can be slowing in process when this occurs which can cause frustration; however, the end result is often longer lasting, stronger, and worth the effort.","Continue to grow.

Over the four years I've spent at Getaround, I feel I have had the opportunity to see management change and grow both professionally and personally. Whether this was the way they interacted with employees or conducted their own initiatives, the common theme has been growth. Like any person who is being honest and real, there are peaks and valleys, new challenges and the ones you've seen before. I would urge the leadership team to continue to embrace challenge, and continue their paths of growth as Getaround continues.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2014-10-14, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best place I've worked!,More than a year,0,"I've been at a few startups. This is probably one of the best places I've worked.

Amazing team with a great culture where people actually care about what they do. Everyone brings a work hard, play hard attitude and gets along very well. Very flat organization structure where all departments collaborate daily and you can really make an impact.

There aren't a lot of politics and not much interoffice drama, although about a year ago there were a few difficult personalities that caused a lot of interoffice strife.

The office environment is very open and everyone gets top-of-the-line hardware and a headset. It's really a great place to work and really rewarding--but practice your foosball if you plan on joining!","Early on the leadership were too soft on prima donna employees who were not top performers. It negatively affected team morale and should have been dealt with swiftly.

Otherwise policies aren't always clear but that seems to have improved. It's a startup so you there's not a lot of handholding when you're new to the team. Because of the very collaborative work-style, the office environment can be noisy at times.",Protect the team and be decisive with people that are not a culture fit.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

- Company vision is one that's easy to get behind, making the world better.
- Management team is good at raising venture funding, company will probably stick around a fair bit longer.","- Founders are dating, resulting in strange blurred lines between professional and personal.
- CEO is not experienced in this area, very quick to dismiss ideas that don't make 'sense to him'.
- Very reactionary. CEO or Marketing Founder would come up with an idea, whole company would shift resources behind it.
- Political environment.
- Compensation is not on par with other companies in Silicon Valley.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
2014-03-06,,,Former Employee ,"Erratic management team, wonderful coworkers",More than a year,0,"Great co-workers who were smart, dedicated, and worked very hard. Most have gone on to much more well-known companies and better careers.

I learned a lot about operations during my stint there (the job requires being well-rounded). The experience there definitely gave me a leg up since I learned to cope with long hours and vigorous albeit irrational demands.","Extremely disorganized leadership team that were hyper-sensitive, reactionary, and micromanaged every project/process. Impromptu marketing campaigns (usually ideas from the female cofounder) trumped more thoroughly planned projects and constantly required the attention of almost the entire office. Engineering releases were few and in between when over half the company were engineers.

Lots of red tape so even small decisions had to go through management which caused operating costs to be very expensive. Very poor financial planning and lots of money spent irresponsibly.

Work-life balance was not respected (even for a startup) and there was lots of inter-office drama/politics for such a small company. The cofounders seemed to thrive in this state of mind.

Raises were only handed out to software engineers or employees who were on the verge of leaving. Definitely not merit-based and most employees felt under-appreciated. The morale was incredibly low at the time I left.",Share praise and give compensation where it is due. Respect your employees and their personal lives outside the work environment.

2018-11-07, Ops,,Former Employee ,RUN RUN RUN as fast as you can from this company,More than 3 years,0,"Friendly people and some hardworking but under appreciated staff. The customer support team, the 'Happiness' team is awesome to deal with and equally under appreciated for what they do. Maybe engaging them in some decisions would be a wise choice since well, they have the pulse on things at all levels and deal with everybody from first call to the end.","Having read all the reviews back to the beginning, sadly little has changed, and they have learned nothing from the very valid feedback. More money has not improved this company or it's efforts to make sound, thoughtful decisions when planning the road ahead. Knee-jerk reactions made by people who are tuned out of reality and have little direct experience in the areas they have been charged with is the norm.

Someone reaches to the CEO directly? OMG, the sky is facking falling. Bad behavior by owners is rewarded with compensation and encourages a downward spiral of expectations that causes all levels to jump because we have to keep everybody happy at all costs. That's not how a solid business operates. Money in the bank now, but this company will not stand the test of time. Flexible policies depending on whether they like an owner, or the owner is a squeaky wheel.

They are starting to hire cheap labor from outside N.A. and the Philippines and disregard treating their core staff with any respect. When the core staff heads for the hills, and they are left with skeleton staff of incompetent people, maybe the message will sink.","Grow a pair. Hold firm on your policies and respect your staff. Attrition will cost you in the long time. How about ""do unto others."" This is not a high school cafeteria.
