There are times when you will have to work late to complete a proposal or other work, but the schedule allows you to work more one day and work less the next (makes it easy to leave work early on Fridays or for long weekends without taking PTO)
- I like the work environment. Everyone is kind and supportive
- Strong Employee Resource Groups (Women's Network, Young Professionals Group, etc.)
- Overall, great place to work!","- Not many PTO holidays given (must use PTO for Christmas Eve, NYE, etc), but fairly generous with PTO
- Late night and weekend work does happen, especially if you work on proposals
- Does not provide a large amount of tuition reimbursement (oly ~5,000/year)

Efforts have been made to be perceived as a ""tech company who happens to do government contracts"" though mostly insincere. It's definitely still very much a ""government contractor who happens to do software.""

Low technical bar for hiring so it could be a good stepping stone for early career folks or ""lifer"" types who just want to do the minimum and grind away until retirement.

Looks ok on the resume in the DC area.

You will relate to every Dilbert cartoon you come across.","Low technical bar, zero focus on culture -- Mostly mediocre unmotivated coworkers.

Culture of doing the bare minimum to ""meet requirements."" -- Mediocre results for clients.

Most teams are best described as boring people doing boring work in a boring place.

Strictly hierarchical decision making process where technology choices are made by non-technical upper management who don't understand the implications of their decisions.

Poor software development practices. Upper management talks about ""agile"" and ""devops"" but these are not done in practice.

Arbitrary deadlines. Management believes stressed out employees is the ultimate sign of productivity.

Management is considered a quasi-retired position which serves as a reward for loyalty/tenure. Most middle managers therefore lack management/leadership skills and simply serve as yes-men for their bosses.

""but we've always done it that way"" ""it's already been decided"" are unofficial company mottos.

Frustrating environment if you take pride in your work/craft due to above issues.

You will relate to every Dilbert cartoon you come across.

-Yearly inflation raise","-Due to the same reason as my first ""pro"", essentially individual divisions don't feel like they're part of Leidos, but more so just has the name. There aren't many benefits of that fact which outweigh the cons, such as education reimbursement. You only get reimbursement or training if your division has enough margin/profit. Even if the company as a whole makes a huge margin, there's no way to improve your education.

-I don't feel like Leidos puts my needs ahead of shareholders. For instance, bonuses disappeared when our previous company was bought by SAIC/Leidos because now all extra profit is given to shareholders. I imagine this is also where potential funds to increase education and have us stick around and feel valued go.

-Benefits keep decreasing.

-We were forced to either go to Walgreens or have medicine shipped to our house, or pay for medicine in full.

I have worked my way up from someone green to a rather senior level where I am a primary decision maker on multiple contracts. My salary has increased by 4x over the 23 years -- growth exists. I am surrounded by really smart people who love solving problems -- hard problems that are of critical importance to the nation.

Salary is pretty good (I think, not looking around), benefits are Meh. But that is the case throughout the industry. For me, the biggest plus is, most mornings, I am excited to go to work and I find the work engaging. I get the tools I need to do the job by one asking once.

One other thing, there is a lot of personal flexibility. In my group, as long as the work gets done (and 80 hours in two weeks are billed), no one cares which hours are worked.","First of all, we are a contracting company. If we do not win new work or recompense, we are laid off, and are on our own to find a new position. The company offers some limited help. No severance, though. But, if you are good, and you network within the company, you can have continuity of employment. In fact, that is what usually happens. Getting a layoff notice, while incredibly stressful, is not considered an embarrassment. But, it does mean that you need to be 100% aware of situations. Let me be clear, though, this is not unique to Leidos. I have friends in other companies that are in the same boat. Basically, if there is no work, there is no job.

Both men are in the same boat as the rest of us, making them awesome ""bosses"" most of the time (see below).
A majority of my Ledios co-workers are amazing and we have a great time together.","Where to start? I work on a military installation, and the contractors at my command are Leidos. We have to work on many holidays that many professional americans have off (Veterans Day, Columbus Day, MLK, etc). I do get 3 floating holidays, but I need to save those for the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and New Years Eve. We do get 8 major holidays off that we are paid. Sometimes the command will ""close"" the office to make sure the duty officer doesn't have to come in, forcing over 20 of us to take the day off. Leidos gives us the option of taking the day as PTO or unpaid any time the command is closed (like for weather or the above scenario).
I get 15 days of PTO a year (been here 3 years) that I have to accrue. That PTO is for vacations, sick time, base closures, etc.
All of the health insurance options are high deductible plans. And I mean high. Don't get sick or have surgery, and you will be ok.
The Leidos supervisors are afraid to irritate the gov't (the customer) and don't call BS as much as they should when we are discriminated against in the command I work in (we are long-term employees - some of us have been here more than 10 years in the same position). We have been called deragatory names to our faces because we are contractors and our bosses report it but do not push for the offending party to be held acountable (I get it - if we lose the contract, they lose their jobs too, but still, the bottom dollar is almighty at Leidos).
We used to have staff meetings 2-3 times a year where they bought us lunch or breakfast (depending on the time of day). The meetings still happen, but they don't feed us anymore. Again, its a small thing, but it is a reminder that saving a couple hundred bucks is more important than making 20+ employees feel valued.

I was told I had the best annual review (and it really was a very good one). I still only got a 3% raise. It doesn's matter if I work my tail off and shine like a supernova or barely do my work, I am going to get a 3% raise.

Our branding is going stronger everyday, but still needs some help. The company is quickly growing and overall its financial stability is strong.","HR needs to change their attitude about how they treat others. Case in point. The HR team in Tennessee sends out a quarterly newsletter with helpful information and statistics. But, included in this newsletter are 2-3 examples of employees who have contacted them with what they perceive as stupid human questions. They call this segment ""We love our humans"".

They never mention the employee by their name, but they do provide the scenario as to why this employee called them and the outcome of the call. In most cases, HR is mocking the employee which I myself find distasteful and unprofessional. I am sure employees outside of HR are not aware of this om-going publication. If they were I am fairly certain it would not go over well.

As for Talent Acquisition, some leaders are overly aggressive and rude to others. It’s their way or no way at all. Leaders also have no sense of personal time meaning that they expects you to answer their call anytime during the day, evening, or weekend. They have little patience for work life balance.

* Their internal technology (such as e-mail) is old and poorly managed. The only access to e-mail is via Outlook Web Access Light (unless you have a Leidos laptop).

* There is much pride in various discussion boards where employees can bring up topics for management review. Unfortunately the answer on whether those topics will be implemented in usually no (unless it does not impact the profit margins).

* The company focuses heavily on tracking your time extremely accurately (in 15-minute increments) but then requires you to complete your timecard before the week ends (and requires extensive documentation if you have to make a change to the hours).

* Salary employees do not appear to actually be paid a salary but just do not receive overtime when they work more then 40 hours (but you still have to fill out a timecard and bill 40 hours a week).

They exist further and further away from the rest of the employees in the division. They don't do reviews for the employees anymore so no feedback on if you are doing good or bad other than a number grade. Don't even tell people if they are getting a raise or not. Most are usually not in their offices and only have program meetings every 6 months to a year.

Even then, they make a lot of people walk over for meeting to the newer office space and schedule an hour for the meeting. Last 15 minutes and it is over. People spend more time walking across the office park to and from the meeting than the actual meeting length. Management knows that morale is bad and said they were going to do quarterly events to boost morale. The management had one event and a Christmas Party over the past year. Probably too expensive and ate too much overhead.

People that should be fired get to stay to the detriment of the work while good people that you want to stay leave because they can find better work conditions and pay elsewhere. All information is compartmentalized and their scheduling is frenetic at best. One day you may be told you are doing X, but then you may do Y. If your not doing Y to their satisfaction, they will ask you to do X without ever talking to you and giving people a chance. Then there are people that can't do Y, but they keep them doing Y until the customer makes a fuss.

As for a tech company, they do everything possible to inhibit you doing the job they want you to do. Then they complain that you are not doing it to their satisfaction or timeliness. Never mind they are never timely about decisions or getting contracts worked out. Need new hardware to do the job correctly, too expensive.","There is no advice because they have had internal audits of the division with HR interviews of the employees and nothing ever really came of it. Initiatives are started, but never seen through. Nothing will change until they get management that knows how to manage people. But when you win a multi-million dollar contract, you are the golden child and none of that matters.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

I was told that I could work from home once a week, because i lived far but i wasn't allowed to because he was so curious, that on days i worked from home would turn out to be 10 hour days.

It was like continuous torture to a point that i had stopped enjoying my job. He will everyday let you know how bad you are at your job however good your results look and he will never appreciate. He will make it look like he is doing great deal of work by saying"" i have so much on my plate or its so easy i can show you this in like 5 minutes "" none of it is true.

There are low level managers in this group with no major educational degrees who actually act like the King (the supervisor)and Queen of the group.
