There is no transparency about pay/hierarchy/career growth on the marketing team.

The department has also allowed some very toxic individuals to succeed without ever seeming to try and amend their behavior. I had a number of astonishingly inappropriate and unprofessional interactions with more than one individual on the marketing team, and my complaints about such treatment were met with excuses for their behavior and no clear sign of interest in addressing these problems. I was not even a direct report to these people - I cannot imagine what they have to deal with on a regular basis. These individuals are people managers with no people skills, and the fact that these people rarely seem to receive any sort of discipline is unbelievable to me.

I have seen a number of people leave (or start planning to leave), myself included, either because they were forced out by toxic individuals or because there was no other option for upward mobility and better compensation.

2018-04-19,,,Former Employee ,Think twice before applying to marketing,,0,"Company mission is excellent, great benefits (fully paid healthcare, unlimited PTO, free lunch, onsite gym, cool office.) CEO genuinely seems like a nice guy.","I'd have to echo the sentiments of my former colleagues who wrote about the terrible state of the marketing ""leadership."" It's a shame, because Chegg has a great mission (and benefits) and potential. The places that effective marketing could take this company would be amazing; but unfortunately the marketing department generates a culture of fear run by toxic individuals--from the very top.

I am not sure why Chegg hasn't listened to the numerous complaints of former employees (which there are a lot of with a continuous revolving door in the marketing department) or done anything to improve the state of the matter for employees. One would think that employees and their skills should be valued--but that sentiment does not exist at all in this division. One can only think that there is a true division between the supposed ""leaders"" and the actual doers. Worst of all, there is no support for women (again, stemming from the top). I don't understand why women would be verbally and emotionally abusive to other women when they should be supporting each other; especially with the current news stories revealing the severe mistreatment of women and the disparity in salary between men and women.

This behavior is building a bad rep in the Valley, which is a pretty small world, not to mention in other markets. Chegg's reputation is also going downhill by failing to address these issues. I would expect the high turnover to continue, which also sets back the company's progress significantly and contributes to a loss of revenue. The effort and loss of time that goes into retraining an employee drastically delays marketing programming and campaign development. Additionally, there are a lot of costs and time that go into searching for and hiring new people, which affects other departments such as HR.

I wonder what the CEO Dan thinks about the negative leadership and loss of money at Chegg?",Listen to your employees and start taking action to get rid of the fear and toxicity.,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0
2018-02-08, Marketing,"Santa Clara, CA",Former Employee ,"Run, run for the hills if you are in the marketing dept.",More than 3 years,0,Employees below director level are amazing in marketing. They are so kind and people genuinely are nice to each other. Not sure how long these folks will stay. Stock is up so probably vesting until they can no longer tolerate the toxic personalities in the marketing org. CMO is genuinely kind but marketing department doesn't get the respect it deserves.,"In the marketing org at the supervisor level there are good supervisors and then there are supervisors who are verbally abusive, tear down direct reports, speak down to any employee junior to them. These types of managers are deserving of being fired, everywhere else but at Chegg apparently. Despite employee complaints these folks are just not held accountable. They are excused for being ""difficult personalities"". The marketing org culture has been greatly impacted. What used to be a good work environment is now a nightmare. The market is up, go find a job where managers actually treat you with respect and like you are a human being. If you are interviewing dig deep to make sure you manager is a good one. Here the manager makes or breaks your experience. After all this you are still considering working here note, depending on the supervisor you report to career growth is limited - nothing you do will be good enough for a promotion and you will be told continuously at every checkin just so you don't forget.","Walk the talk and listen to your employees in marketing.

2018-02-01, Tutor,,Current Employee ,Unsatisfied Tutor,More than a year,0,"Pay is excellent - $20 an hour, paid weekly via Paypal. I find that my lessons are usually more in-depth, and I've built up a few students that I work with on a weekly or even daily basis which keeps cash flow. I love watching my regular students improve their English over time, as I get a ton of ESL students wanting help with writing.","The population of tutors vs. students using the service is way too dense. Recently, Chegg said they wanted to help with this by clearing out tutors with bad reviews and requiring new tutors to pass a subject exam before being onboarded (the exam is only 10 questions so it's hardly rigorous). However, there are still way too many tutors. Students are not routed to you - they post their request on what is basically a message board, and then every tutor logged on who wants to help can reply to the posting via message, basically swamping the student with 20+ requests to choose from and hoping you get picked. A lot of times, the students want you to work for free or just want answers to the questions without doing any actual work. This would be much more enjoyable if I didn't have to compete against thousands of other tutors to get one student.","Clear out the tutor community and have more rigorous hiring standards so us good tutors with good reviews have more opportunities to get work and get paid. Look at the model that Tutor.com uses - I also work with them and have no shortage of work. In fact, I get students routed TO ME! Also, work on recruiting more students to the service so that there's more work. Too many tutors and not enough students means I spend 12 hours a day on the site to hopefully make $30-$40, if I'm lucky. Most days it's more like $10 or $20, mostly thanks to my repeat students.

The CEO loves to hear himself talk but doesn't really add any value. He spends a lot of time on CNBC talking about his days at Yahoo. But no one seems to realize that Yahoo lost market share to Google and Facebook during his reign as COO.

Base pay and benefits are pretty good. They provide lunch/drinks/snacks.

Work/life balance is generally good - if you know what you're doing, you can get away with a 35-40 hour workweek. They have an unlimited vacation policy and don't discourage employees from taking lots of vacation; however this places an added burden on the people who do not take much vacation. You may also be expected to pull some long hours if it's a busy time or if your manager screws up and you have to work double time to fix it. But generally it's okay and the hours are flexible.

The stock was depressed for a long time, but is now at fair value or perhaps a bit too high. This was great if you invested at the right time and got a nice payout, however it also means there is little upside remaining.","There are no bonuses for rank-and-file employees. There are very few promotions. This is no longer a growth company, and the few promotions that happen are political - it entirely depends on whether your manager has influence with leadership - and as a result the small number of promotions disproportionately go to Directors. There is no transparency around employee growth. This combination of factors results in essentially no incentive to work hard if you're a rank-and-file employee.

Due to the limited performance requirements and the lack of career or financial opportunity, most high performers end up leaving after a couple of years, while the mediocre employees remain. As a result, the overall quality of talent is average.","While there is some appeal to the relaxed culture of this company, the lack of incentives result in a lack of motivation and poor talent retention in your workforce.

Build tools are organized. Test framework is enforced.

Facilities and snacks are good.

HR offers good perks /parties

Co-workers are good.","Rampant favoritism, politics and nepotism. You have to be in the right group/team to get a promotion or raise. There is no clear path to getting any kind of advancement in your career. If you don’t come with the right connections you won’t get to work in different areas or things you like.

The middle management is very big and slow moving. The managers usually end up doing the same work as PMs do and they overlap with each other’s roles. Managers are mostly not hands on and give very little technical guidance or feedback. There is a lot of pressure and quick criticism from different corners but no real direction or planning.

The management is not really concerned with the team’s growth or development. Workers are purely resources with no real identity (unless you have the right connection or referral). There is no effective review process. Goals are set and then forgotten quickly. No bonuses or any real compensation is based on hard work (and there is a LOT of hard work).

Work-life balance is pretty bad. You will be asked to work weekends to match unrealistic goal setting and expectation of upper management’s part. Management DOES NOT consult with teams before setting deadlines and set arbitrary and impossible deadlines. Designs are changed mid-project, there is no documentation or processes … No clear direction. Extremely dis-organized and chaotic.","1. Promote and motivate the hard workers.

By far, this is one of the best assembled executive leadership teams around.

Majority of code is discarded after ""A-B"" test concluded.

Little to no interaction with product management. You will not learn about the domain at all beyond a 1 hour meet and greet bone thrown your way every once in awhile
No incentives in place to maintain motivation","1. To build a world-class engineering organization you need to put incentives in place to attract and keep world-class talent. A near-market salary is not incentive enough and the options being offered are not enough
2. Ensure that people have titles that are reflective of their actual capabilities. There is nothing worse then working w/ people that are less capable then yourself in positions much higher within the organization
3. Promote engineers that get work done no matter what the cost. There is a tendency to hire/promote people that talk the talk but never or can't walk the walk. World class organizations are built by people that roll up their sleeves and get the work done.
4. Ensure that only high-quality candidates get through the door for on-site interviews especially if they are interviewing for Senior positions
5. Ensure that the people that do the work and generate the ideas are the same people who present those ideas and get recognition for their hard work. There is nothing more demoralizing then pouring blood, sweat and tears into something and having someone else be recognized for it
6. Improve the software development process. There is a significant lack of true software product management (not visionaries) and QA standards
7. Ensure that managers hold all team members to equal standards and those in senior positions to higher standards still
8. Consider promoting the hard workers to leadership/management roles within the organization. This will set an example for hard work

I could keep going on for quite a while. Chegg has exceeded every expectation I had and continues to do so.

I think that the greatest underlying success about Chegg is management's transparency.

The new HQ office (as of Oct 2012) doesn't have the view--but makes up for it with much more space to grow.

If you're just looking for a job that you can go to for 8 hours and return home thinking that you were fishing the whole time--please don't bother applying. We have some of the brightest minds working on monumental problems with a mission to make a better world by improving education. There are days that I'll keep working on a problem past 5pm--not because I need to--but because I want to. In fact--even if I were to leave the company--I would still try to find the solution to that problem; because I love what I do.

Be very selective when hiring managers as we continue to grow. The managers we currently have are all great--but its only obvious that we'll need more as we continue adding more engineers to our workforce. I've seen (and worked at) too many places ruined by managers that can drive the talent out of a company in the matter of months.

2010-09-09, Picker,"Shepherdsville, KY",Former Employee ,"Seasonal employee review for Chegg warehouse in Shepherdsville, KY.",,0,"Competitive wages: $11.00 per hour for seasonal employees.

Decent hours: Average 35+ hours a week with occasional overtime.

Weekly pay (if employed through a staffing agency, bimonthly pay if employed directly through Chegg).

Nice facility: Very clean temperature controlled break-room/restrooms, with plenty of seating, vending machines, refrigerators, and microwaves. Partially covered smoking area outside of break-room. Lockers for personal belongings. Ample parking.

Two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch for an 8 hour shift, additional 15 break after 8 hours (subtract 5+ minutes for the time it takes to walk to and from work area to break room)

Free lunch on Fridays with a 45 minute lunch break.","POOR MANAGEMENT STYLE: Apparently it is company policy at Chegg to treat their seasonal employees as though they are sub-human, not needed, and not wanted, with their goal being fear instead of motivation. I always felt as though at any moment I could lose my job, even though I was ranked among the top 5 out of 100+ pickers. I never got any compliments for my effort, but instead received negativity, or was ignored completely. I do not need to be coddled, but an occasional nice word goes a long way. ""We do not need you here, and you can easily be replaced"" that is a direct quote from the head warehouse manager at one of our group's many ""motivational"" meetings. Many times I would see what I can only call call temper tantrums by the leads and management alike. People getting screamed at and belittled in front of other employees as if though they were children, Chegg's turnover rate is astronomical, I saw groups of 25+ employees come and go several times, and I was only employed by them for about 6 weeks.

UNREACHABLE UNIT PER HOUR GOAL: If you are a picker at Chegg you are demanded to reach 100+ books picked per hour, or 700+ books picked in an 8 hour shift, the penalty for not reaching that goal is loss of employment. Unfortunately the system that prints the pick orders causes you to have to go into a flat out run from one end to the other of this extraordinarily large, non-temperature controlled warehouse to reach that goal. The average person could only reach 75 picked books per hour if they were really hustling, and lost there jobs even though they were hard workers. I managed to get into the top 5 pickers by figuring out how to print orders that were easy, and even then I had to really move quickly to keep up the pace. If something happens and the system isn't working correctly, you are still expected to meet and exceed your goal. The staffing agency even had a person from there office come in and work in the warehouse to see if he could meet Chegg's goal, and he failed.

POOR TRAINING: Even though picking is not a difficult job, being told to ""figure it out"" is probably not the best way to train people. I asked each picking lead to show me the best way to do the job and each one of them told me ""you have have to figure out your own way"". I made many mistakes my first week and was told I would be let go if I didn't figure it out.

LACK OF COMMUNICATION: I never knew where I stood as far as meeting my goal for the day, if I asked a question, I was answered with a half answer, or ignored completely by my lead. What to do, or what not to do was never very clear, if you make a mistake that's when you found out what not to do, then you would be threatened to get ""wrote up"" or ""fired"". I never knew when my shift was going to end, or if I had to work the weekend until the very last possible second. If you had plans, or something important to do on the weekend, you had better be able to drop them, because if you don't drop everything for Chegg, you guessed it, termination. I found that avoiding leads and management was best. All in all, it is not a very proactive system.","There are stress management programs, along with programs that will teach management/leads how to properly and professionally deal with and motivate employees. I strongly advise enrolling the entire management team ASAP.

Redesigning the warehouse to be more efficient is a must! Take a page from UPS or one of the other large companies around town.

Setting and completing goals should be based on the individual persons abilities, instead of some random unobtainable number.

Treat people with respect and they will respect you in return. People that are treated poorly will not care about their job, or their job performance. Good communication is the key to success for any company. If management doesn't let people know what to do or how to do it, then the company and employees will always fail.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.5,1.0,

Our manager had always listened to us and motivated the team and had given us the chances to work with new stack which ultimately upgraded individual's morale.

It was a tough decision to leave such an enthusiastic team and a great company with values. But as I had planned to settle in Australia, so I expressed my decision to my manager. Respecting my decision he had offered me a contract role to work remotely for the company. Even the interviewers in Australia were really impressed with Chegg for valuing an employee and offering the remote work opportunity.

In that period I got 251 positive reviews. I was able to share my experience of 25 years as a university professor. At the same time I made an effort to comply with the code of honor of the company. I also reported numerous times to some dishonest students who pretended to cheat with their fraudulent lessons. Suddenly and without further explanations CHEGG has suspended my account. I have asked them to reconsider my case since I really need that extra income to be able to feed my family since in my country Venezuela there is an economic and social crisis. The answer has always been the same. I get the impression that which robots already have a script prepared for each case. I regret that they did not analyze my case in depth and that they evidently heeded a ""student"" who fabricated false evidence against me and that I had previously warned about his threats. That is why I consider that the company is acting in an inhuman way without social sensitivity towards the tutors. It seems that students are always right because they are the ones who pay. I have asked them to take my case to the executive levels that can reverse this decision, but they respond very quickly saying that the decision is final and with the same text copied from the initial decision. This shows that they do not have the minimum interest to analyze my case in depth. I hope this can reach the ears of sensitive people who can reconsider my case.",Listen to the tutors please!,1.0,,,,,

2010-03-08, Regional Manager Campus Operations,,Former Employee ,Chegg will haunt you for years to come if you work with them.,,0,The schedule was flexible and my boss at the time (he no longer works there) worked really great with me and communicated well.,"When I first interviewed with Chegg.com, I was told I would be working on college campuses with students. I asked what we would be doing when the students were out of session (over the summer) and they told me they would have more work for us to do: not to worry.

The job went well; I highly enjoyed what I did. I started work in January 2007. I set-up promotions on campuses to raise awareness of chegg.com and got students to sign up.

June rolled around and Chegg decided to fly all its regional managers of campus operations to Vegas to train us for the work we would do over the summer. Basically, we trained for 3-5 hours and Chegg.com sent us out VIP style in Vegas- limos, bottles, blowing loads of money on us. This is where I met the senior management and some investors. We then returned home and started to get to work. At which point, I realized that they wanted us to basically do ""media sales"" for the website but had no packages set-up to sell. We called into senior execs at companies and when they asked us what we had to sell, timelines- I drew a blank. Having never been in sales before, I contacted my manager and let him know that they had to come up with a better plan; we can't go and sell nothing essentially. A few days later, they started laying off the regional employees. I was laid off too. Also, at which point they said we may be asked to return to work when the fall semester starts.

When I was let go, I was asked to return my cell and mac, which Chegg provided for business. I asked for two weeks to get the stuff off my mac and sent my cell away using their UPS shipping account. Verbally, they told me I had two weeks to turn in my computer. Ok. Friday of the weekend of my last paycheck roles around (I have one more week to turn in my computer and my blackberry has been shipped and is on the way) Great. I got paid. I paid all my bills electronically online and sent out a rent check Saturday. On Monday, Chegg decides they will withdrawal my paycheck (and expenses) from my bank account to hold ransom until the mac and cell are sent. Because I had paid my bills online, they went through on Monday and Tuesday and the overdraft fees built up to over $400. When confronted Chegg, they told me they withdrew it because I had not sent my mac and cell as agreed upon. Chegg didn’t bother to check their UPS account to even see that the cell had been sent and that there was one more week for me to turn in the computer. Also, I had told chegg.com I needed shipping supplies to send the mac back so that it would get there unharmed. I had no money to pay for shipping (as they took all my money) and they demanded that I figure it out to send it back. I had to scramble to pay rent and to cover my overdraft fees plus my bills alone and pay for shipping/supplies.

That same Monday that my paycheck was withdrawn, I applied for unemployment. A few days later I received a letter in the mail saying I was rejected because Chegg didn’t pay my unemployment taxes. I was shot out of money and luck here.

So I deal with it all, borrow money from family, pay the bills. I’m absolutely frustrated that they did this and was leaving for a tour so I decide I’m just going to keep my computer, because for all I know they won’t give me that money- seeing as how they just withdrew it from my bank account without letting me know. No warning, no nothing. I decided I need to swap the computer in person and get a handwritten check. That way I am sure to get that money. A few months down the line I am in NYC and decide to meet-up with my old manager. We swap the computer for my paycheck in a park. I go to the closest bank and cash it immediately. Finally.

Fast forward 2.5 years later. I get a letter from the IRS randomly stating that I owe over $4000 in taxes for the work I did for Chegg. Chegg filed me as a 1099 not a W-2. I decide I am going to fight this and I present my case to the IRS. After numerous days retrieving old documents, I put together a case. I appeal to the IRS. I have kept my offer letter, pay stubs and health insurance plan Chegg had me on. I present the case and I am ruled that I was legitimately an employee and chegg.com failed to withhold taxes correctly. IRS decided to go after them. Looking back, I recall Chegg saying they didn’t have a business license to operate outside of California which must be why the 1099 came into play. I can assure you Chegg is getting audited. Especially since the Regional Manager of Campus operations in Boston had the same thing happen to her over the taxes- I’m sure the rest of them did as well. That can’t be fun for Chegg.

Chegg was awful. Communication was bad. Business tactics were awful. Unfortunately, I think I may have to get involved with Chegg never paying the unemployment that was rightfully mine. Also, they never reimbursed mileage expenses. They have been the biggest headache ever.
After all, Chegg did ask me to return to work for them in the Fall.",Learn to run a real business. Get some legitimate executives in there that know what they are doing. Treat your employees better.,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.5,1.0,
