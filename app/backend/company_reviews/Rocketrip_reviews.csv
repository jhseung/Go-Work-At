- Friendly, smart, collaborative coworkers who push you to bring your best self to work every day.

- Opportunities for career growth. I’ve seen several of my peers rise through the ranks and my own manager and I regularly talk about my growth and development. I’ve also seen multiple people make lateral moves based on personal career goals and thrive in their new roles.

- Leaders regularly communicate plans for the company’s future during weekly and monthly company-wide meetings. We use OKRs to ensure everyone’s goals are aligned and a platform that allows for total transparency on the progress of each person’s objectives.

- Feedback is well received and encouraged. I’ve witnessed countless examples. As long as you’re professional about the way you share feedback, it’s respected.

- Throughout my time here we’ve had a diverse team and have held regular D&I discussions to continue to educate the team. The company has also promoted a number of female employees to management or exec-level positions.

If you can’t be self-sufficient there’s a chance you’ll struggle.

Any prospective employee deserves to know what a toxic and abusive environment Rocketrip is, so they don’t make the same mistake as so many of us.

Working here is mentally and emotionally draining. Positive contributions are rarely recognized, and talented people are often let go because the execs want people with more “team spirit,” regardless of how much they help improve the product.

Rocketrip’s game plan is to work their employees to exhaustion, then every 1-2 months there will be a company-sponsored event with an open bar where they will encourage employees to get as drunk as possible. At my first Rocketrip party, a few months into working there, I saw managers and execs throwing up in the street before 9pm, then coming to work the next day complaining about how hungover they were. It fostered an unprofessional and unsafe environment, and I often feared for the wellbeing of my coworkers.",Hire an actual HR team to address professional and cultural issues.

It makes me feel mentally unsafe, I have physical symptoms of extreme anxiety almost daily, and am made to feel my contributions to this company are worthless (but watch management pass them off as their own 6+ months later).

Rocketrip fires people all the time, often without reason, so there isn't really much job security either. I can't think of a single department where layoffs haven't happened.

They also bring in senior management people who have no clue what the company is doing, but feel the need to tell everyone what is best for the company within 1-2 weeks of starting. They usually leave within 6 months and the cycle begins again. There is no stability or room for growth here, since they rarely promote people to meaningful positions from within.

To their credit, I did learn while I was here, especially when I first started. However, as time went on Rocketrip became worse and worse. Internally, management started taking out their fear of competitors and product/market fit on their own employees, and not taking responsibility for their own actions. They act without remorse.

Oh, and also if you aren't a big drinker, BEWARE of this place. I've seen people throw up and pass out before 8 at their parties. It's actually dangerous and negligent to treat employees like this.

I am only writing this review because I can see the company flooding their page with false positive reviews - I want any potential employees to know the truth before accepting an offer here. If I were an outlier, I wouldn't do this, but I have spoken with many employees who agree with me about this. This is not a nice place to work - it is damaging, and it will suck you in until you are in too deep to get out.","Please take a look at your culture and try to mend it.
