The work is interesting but it doesn't have to consume all the hours in the day, nights, weekends.

2018-08-25,,,Current Employee ,Best company I've worked for,Best company I've worked for,0,"Octo values employees and rewards them. I love the tuition program!! It is superb and far above other companies and what they offer (if anything). The benefits are good and affordable for my family. There's a state of the art kitchen for employees with common/shared areas to eat, a nice office layout with lots of modern decor, really cool vending machines, free lunch provided often, and all kinds of team events sponsored by the company. My colleagues are friendly and team players. One of my coworkers had a personal issue and our manager went out of their way to help them. That meant a lot and it shows the type of people we work with because they care to make a difference and help.

The mindset is progressive at Octo and results matter. Sometimes we work longer hours. However, I don't mind because it's recognized when I do and I know anything in life that's worth having doesn't come easily. My coworkers are hard working people that will go the extra mile. Decide for yourself but most likely if you work here you'll see the same. When things are good people often don't take the time to share. That's because like me they are happy and busy working and not trolling the internet looking to complain. Some of these recent negative reviews on Glassdoor are unfounded. Are they Octo's competitors trying to steal our business? Maybe disgruntled employees terminated for bad behavior/performance? I don't know but some of the things they said are kind of laughable and it reflects more negatively on them and their lack of professionalism. Don't tarnish a good company's name! I'm proud to work at Octo. I had a few job offers when I joined Octo. I'm glad I chose to work here and I would make the same decision again. It is the best place I've worked.

Octo's leadership team is solid and I trust them. They try to help the employees. No place is perfect. However, I've seen them keep the employees' best interests at the forefront in their decision making. The Glassdoor comments posted about Bob the COO - those seem like they were made by someone with a personal agenda. I've worked with Bob for awhile and he is a good leader and person. He has a backbone. I'd rather have a leader with one than without. He has a vision and has implemented it. Mehul the CEO is awesome and down to earth. See for yourself.

It is what you make of it here. If you are a hard worker and apply yourself you will do well at Octo. There are lots of possibilities and opportunities. I wouldn't stay here if there weren't.

That’s it.,"Where does one begin. They pit their employees against each other for Sr management’s entertainment. Everyone knows you either belong to the VA Tech Club or the Century club... and if you don’t fall into one of those categories you’re treated horribly. There is no accountability from anyone and the biggest job of any senior executive is to blame someone else for the failures. Anyone with the title of Director or above cares about only that their title and not their employees. Do NOT expect your boss or HR to have your back. Sr Mgmt allows employees to be berated and spoken too like children and say nothing. One of the founding partners constantly looks down his nose at you and judges you if you are not wearing the most expensive clothes or up on high end lines. There is a complete disregard for all employees at a moments notice. They will try to tell you they support you when you are treated unprofessionally then write you up and take the same incident and turn it around on you the employee and terminate you as a result even though you were the repeated victim of the very hostile and unprofessional behavior. If you see a positive review written about this company either one of the recruiters wrote it or they gave someone a nice bonus too. The only true statement in these posts is that Mehul is the nicest and sweetest CEO I’ve had the opportunity to support. He makes it a point to know everyone of his employees names and greets them whenever he sees them, even with the high turn over he will remember your name. The COO is the driving force of the hostility and toxic environment. Employees are encouraged to stay away from the owner and vice verse so no one can tell him about the sweat shop treatment that 80% of his employees are subjected too. Oh and stay away from the coffee machine on the executive side... you will be fired if used without certain peoples approval. The open office concept sucks since you can’t conduct business at your desk without disrupting others. If you don’t go out and get drunk with them or attend certain executives swing parties again not part of the in crowd. Worst part is everyone knows this is the culture, it’s been the culture for over 3 years, and they refuse to do anything to change it. Anything else you can think of that would be a con trust me it happens here.","Tell Mehul get rid of his outside investors take control back of his company and change the culture and moral before you are either forced to shut down or sell. If Octo continues on its current path, word of mouth will be the downfall of this company. You know you are horrible to work for when your employees call around looking for new positions begging anyone to “save them” from the toxicity that is Octo.

I perused Glassdoor before I joined Octo and wasnt sure what was true and what wasn't, other than they impressed me with their culture during the interview process and what I had heard from others I knew that worked with them. The truth is that NO company is perfect, and Octo is no different.

However, I can report that so far if you are looking for a place that:
- Is transparent with sharing its corporate strategy and direction
- Lays out how you fit into the firm
- Gives a ton of money for personal development and free on-site classes for Agile certs
- Has genuine people that are serious about their work, but don't take themselves too seriously
- Offers above average comp benefits and perks and bonuses at all levels

Then this is a pretty good place to work.

Couple things that impressed me thus far. Firm held a series of focus groups to gather feedback on a new career progression model. New model does a much better job of addressing a career path for technical engineers like me. Most firms, would not invest a ton of ton adjusting to that kind of feedback. Most management is pretty approachable too. The CEO held a really big summer party for the entire firm and all their families at his house. There are politics as you go up the leadership chain, but no more than any other firm. The leaders seem very sincere in how they listen to you, which is a big deal in how I assess whether a place is a decent place to work.","Firm needs to do a better job of addressing how technical folks can add value to the firm strategic direction. Some folks perceive that proposals are the only way to go. Some of this is being addressed in the new career model that is still being developed, but still an issue.

Like any firm, there are pockets of folks that like to complain about whatever. It could be the weather, the customer, their workload. I find this really irritating. Every firm has them, but it doesn't make it any less annoying.

There was not much in the way of orientation to the firm. My PM spent a great deal of time explaining the ins and outs, but I expected a more formal orientation. I've heard other new hires say the same.","I have worked at 3 different firms in my career before Octo. Have to say this place ranks at the top of the places I've worked at so far. Management needs to keep being real with its employees and stay connected with what the employees are saying like I have seen so far. I would also recommend they hire folks that have a work hard, but laid back mindset. The folks here work hard and management asks a lot beyond just working at client site sometimes.

2012-11-29, Senior Associate,"McLean, VA",Former Employee ,Great place to work - recommend Octo highly,Great place to work - recommend Octo highly,0,"- Great firm that provides excellent growth opportunities for talented and motivated consultants
- Young and energetic workforce with strong talent levels
- Dynamic leadership team that is serious about creating a fun and rewarding work environment, where everyone shares in the successes of the company
- Very competitive salary with extremely generous benefits (great healthcare, PTO, 401(k) etc.). Many additional perks (such as free iPads, spot bonuses, frequent company dinners/happy hours, annual offsite)
- As the leadership will proudly tell you: 'Octo has an extremly low jerk count compared to most workplaces'. They genuinely do - the company is filled with exceptionally nice people
- Surprisingly mature infrastructure and support functions (for a smaller company)

Overall, if you want to work for a dynamic consultancy that is causing a stir in the industry (in a good way), look no further than Octo. I spent 3 years there and loved every minute.","Very few. Occasionally the hours can be long, but no worse than any other companies in this industry. There have been challenges associated with growing so fast, but those have generally been well managed.

The company focuses on internal and external networking and ways for employees to share ideas.
- The company offers opportunities to grow professionally by taking part in new business pursuits, $5K per year in tuition reimbursement for educational growth, and the ability to participate on teams to coordinate social events and activities.
- Competive pay/raises and a very good benefits package.
- Management team that has been able to grow the business without sacrificing the company's core culture (balance of working hard, having fun, and growing).
- The stability of a larger company with a smaller company feel.",- Implementing a number of internal processes (painful as company grows),"- Continue communicating regularly with employees about the direction of the company and growth plans. It keeps employees feeling like they are key part of the company and its plans.

- Try to maintain the culture as the company grows.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

They want their developers to become salesmen or businessmen.
They also hire developers based solely on their resume and if they have a clearance. They do not vet their applicants.
Salaries are not competitive.
Employees are not merited based on their job performance on a project or how happy a customer is, but on how much extra internal work they do. They are expected to work extra hours/nights/weekends on internal Octo tasks in addition to their overtime spent on client work.
They have a motto that I can't remember, it went something like:
Total Control
Total Commitment

Equals Zero Excuses","Learn how other companies manage developers and development projects.
Take the advice of your good developers.
Do not force employees to become businessmen.
Do not try to win business by agreeing to impossible to meet goals/deadlines.
