2018-11-14,,"Mountain View, CA",Current Employee ,"Incredibly bureaucratic, seemingly meaningless work, but hey, seems like they pay most people pretty well.",,0,A pretty nice campus with some cute dogs and a cafe with free coffee and tea. Cafeteria has pretty good variety too. Parking is plentiful and it's in a safe and quiet neighborhood next to a golf course. People seem to get paid pretty well in general at Samsung in comparison to a lot of other competing Bay Area tech companies.,"1. Incredibly bureaucratic, hierarchical structure makes things difficult:
Now this is going to be the complaint of most everyone at large international corporations. I'm totally aware of that and am also aware of what other large corporations are like internally. The bureaucracy is on another level at Samsung. Every decision you make in management at some point in the chain goes back to Korea. Everything you do on your work computer is monitored by someone in Korea. You must fill out intense and tedious paperwork to gain approval to do almost anything and take extensive classes to learn how to assess your employees, your coworkers, your managers in the terms asked by HQ (every employee learns this pretty quickly it's not just a manager thing lol.) A lot of the issues in management and hierarchy are cultural to Samsung's business in Korea. Although management in the US across departments are constantly attempting to change their work environments, they cannot change where the budget comes from. Every decision made about every product / project comes down to the opinion of an executive. It's pretty exhausting. I'm sure it's probably exhausting for some of the executives too.

2. Sunday is Monday in Korea:
Work life balance is fine for the people that have it fine. For those who don't...it's not. This is something once again you'll find most anywhere but one thing is for sure -- Sunday in the US is Monday in Korea.

3. Not really a forward thinking company:
Overall Samsung is not really a forward thinking company. They have some great products and the semiconductor business is going well for those involved in that (they have a beautiful campus in San Jose.) But overall Samsung is often fighting against itself. Concepts are thrown away immediately if they do not make profit, teams are downsized at the will of executives to make room for new projects that get shut down when they don't immediately perform at the capacity executives would like. There is not ""lets build something for 5 years out"". It's mostly a business based on ""How do we make sales in the next two years?"" All Silicon Valley companies are aiming towards the future in some sense but a good way to gauge how forward thinking a company may be is the number of employees. Companies who hire large staff for research and concept building tend to keep more in the vault. That being said there is an incredibly large number of Samsung employees in Korea and many groundbreaking innovations in HQ. The same just simply can't be said for most of its American subsidiaries.

Even if the money is worth the stress temporarily it seems like there's a pretty high turnaround. Not sure where your limits are but seems like most are about 2 years. I'm not actually sure if that's good or bad, that's just how it is.",Honestly a lot of managers in the US seem to know what they are doing. I would beg mgmt in the US to do everything possible not to micromanage their teams even further and to hire larger teams (which I know isn't the easiest thing because of budget.),2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,

Other big-name companies will make sure people laid off can be settled into other hiring needs of other internal teams, but Samsung won't do it. And other big-name companies will make sure when a lay-off notice is made to the employee, the impacted employees will have two months or even one year of paid time to search for internal jobs or external jobs, but Samsung won't do it, and Samsung will only gives you about 10 days of notice, and HR will stop picking up your calls to help you search for internal roles because you're on the list to be laid off.","If you don't take care of your employees, your employees won't take care of you either.

HR is deeply broken. Forget anonymity. In fact, if you have an issue to report, expect HR to go directly to your boss and start gossiping about you to others.

Seniors leaders do not inspire and have do not have any sense of vision. They just execute on what Korea HQ tells them to do.

Zero career development.

Work from home days are tracked and typically cannot exceed 2 per month.

Zero trust in employees.

The best talent leaves within 2 years, so at this point the only people left are in many cases damaged goods - manipulative, poor management skills, and deeply entrenched in office politics.

There is no progression path available, despite multiple promises to create one. The company expects you to be available 24/7, and blacks you out from PTO for more than 6 months out of the year...without prior notice. Also, although the position hires you as a M-F employee, they change the schedule randomly, as they see fit, and without prior notice which often ends in you having no weekend or working 6 day work weeks.","Your most valuable asset is your people. Saying thank you at meetings isn't enough. You need to be consistent, communicate with other departments and the field, and consider that those in the field are PEOPLE. What makes your field team so great is the individual contributions. Stop making every territory fit into your box and your field reps you robots to use at your disposal.

Bloated leadership - too many leaders and not enough do-ers, which makes accomplishing anything difficult.","More flexible work arrangements. Increase the allotted 2 days of working from home to something more reasonable, especially for those who travel for business. Set a more even playing field for upward mobility and enforce appropriate workload by job type and level. Samsung rarely promotes within, especially for marketing. There are staff and lower manager level employees with equal or higher levels of responsibility and workloads than senior managers and directors. Some directors have 3xs the workload of a senior director. I've also seen senior managers report to managers and individuals be promoted based on personal relationships with their supervisors (they were friends before working together at Samsung) rather than their job performance. Also, some managers promote more frequently than others. So you may be in a stagnant role because your supervisor doesn't care about developing your career, or they don't want to do the heavy admin work it takes to promote one of their staff members. HR and company in general undervalue long-term employees...you are treated as if you're lucky to still be there if you've lasted 3+ years. Also, contractors are expected to contribute the same and perform as FTE's (full-time employees), but they are not treated as such. They receive only 1-2 weeks PTO, no bonuses, and have horrible insurance plans that are not the same as Samsung FTEs. Contractors have little to no potential of being converted to full Samsung employees regardless of how well they perform in their role. If they are no longer needed i.e. ""contract is over"" they are not eligible for severence pay (or likely unemployment), regardless of their years of service.",3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0

Harassed by upper management imparring growth both within the company and connecting professionally

Petty childish like behavior ""by upper management"" i.e. workplace bullying, unwanted sexual advances, making rude unnecessary comments and sadly much more thing to list.","Knowing what I know now I would go to a higher up higher them my manager to report the poor behavior that was happening. I suggest you make it more convenient for those in your company (be that direct and 3rd party) to speak up and report major manager issues.
I feel it is sad that employees like myself have a very hard time voicing them, and didn't even get to defend themselves.
Especially if the employee is honestly passionate about the company and truly in there heart wanted nothing other then to grow with the company in a very positive way. In today's world loyalty is hard to find, let alone hire.
Most people get jobs to get by etc, it's rare kind of person who actually wants to be a part of something.

The HR policies in place are out dated. If good talent is not happy in current role and employee is transparent on what and where they want to take their career inside of Samsung, HR should help instead of discourage. Samsung is losing really great talent and motivated employees due to this. I have seen it on my team as well as other teams. If an employee is open and honest with their manager and HR that is great because some will never be so if they are telling their leadership team that they are unhappy with their current role, want to stay with Samsung but would like a change, HR and leadership team should help assist that person instead of forcing them out and making look outside of Samsung.","If an employee is being open and honest about their career within Samsung, help them out do not force them out of the company. Be open and honest with them. This is a new era in the workplace, a happy and positive employee will have so much more of a greater impact on others that you will never believe. I would love to see the attitude of employees towards Samsung turn around. Also, promote your employees, do not make them wait 5 years to get to the next level.

This is one of the most miserable places to work. The Koreans themselves and long-term workers are those bringing this place down, through lack of ability and incompetence. This is not a fun tech company, this is not a cutting edge learn a lot type of company, this is a slow bloated company full of unfulfilling work, politics, and dead-ends.

It's an absolute shock when there are reviews with over 3 stars given on here, it's nowhere near a 4 or 5 star rating. This is not a great place to work, and don't expect any growth either. Rarely do internal workers get considered for different roles. Performance rarely leads to promotion, it is more weighted on your ability to fraternize - not performance. If you get a job here you will instantly wonder how the company got this far. HR tries to make attempts at making the culture more enjoyable which is synonymous with American, but it's a battle against a Korean culture too disconnected from humanity that the efforts always come up short.

There are definitely long-term workers here that need to be let go, they push their work onto those beneath them and don't actually provide much value themselves - not to mention their wasteful large salaries. There are also toxic workers who have been reported numerous times with no actual improvement or removal of them. In comparison to the outside image of the company, you will be surprised how the internal operations do not come close to what you expect. For this company to improve internally, long-term workers and Koreans would need to be let go, and embrace a more contemporary culture, or simply sell the subsidiary to the US.

The philanthropic efforts by the CEO are something you won't see in too many places.","As many other reviews have stated, this place is fast paced and regardless of your role, you are ""on call"" at all times. If you have a family, be prepared to make lots of sacrifices for this purpose as work/life balance is non-existent. Other possible cons are if you are a non-Korean speaker this puts you at a disadvantage in terms of career growth as the higher you get, the more it becomes an expectation (unofficially). My advice is to know that for the North American market, you have two managers, your direct (likely non-Korean) boss and an unofficial ""dispatcher"" (someone sent from HQ Korea) to watch over your team's efforts. Once you recognize the two layers of leadership and the ambitious (see: unrealistic) yearly goals, you can focus on what you can control and work towards meeting certain goals. Finally, be prepared to deal with inexperienced managers that put in the time for their role, but have never been trained to handle leadership function (also see: lack of ongoing training programs)",Transparency is lacking all around - reset your culture and be transparent by setting expectations from the start. Look for ways to make your employees full time and avoid contractors and third party layers - it is not working for other Fortune 50 companies and is creating a toxic environment and resentment from all.

Suffering together truly brings a group of people closer. As many have said in other reviews, HQ makes all decisions and treat their workers terribly. They do not value their employees like they say they do. They don't care about the fact that you have a life outside of work. When executives come to the office to visit, it's like the queen of England has landed. All attention is on them and you live in fear for however long they are visiting. Executives have all the power, and it's pretty ridiculous how much Samsung emphasizes rank and hierarchy. The amount of politics is unbelievable, and every process us cumbersome. I understand that being a global company, security and approvals are important. But sometimes, it's to a point where it even affects and delays projects. Promotions are ridiculously hard to get and annual pay raises are so small, I would rather just not get one. Finance is incredibly tight and they do their best to squeeze as much juice out of an employee as they can with minimal pau before that employee has had enough and leaves with their own feet. Even the way they let go of employees is brutal and cruel. Work-life balance is non-existent and no promise made by management is kept. Most people stay for two years MAX, and then they dip. Some employees hear on their first day of work: ""this isn't a place you should stay for long. Pay your dues for two years, and get out."" It's pretty depressing. I could go on and on about the cons.

- Base salary is above average, given the lack of engineering background requirement
- Anyone below senior level engineer gets paid for OT, which you do a lot of.
- If you like traveling, Bellevue QA has lots business trip opportunities; just don't expect to have time for site-seeing.
- You get to use the latest Samsung phones before it hits the market.","As a general SEA employee:
- Work culture and processes are completely dictated by Korean HQ; therefore, you can kiss your work-life balance good-bye.
- HR is pretty worthless, in a sense that they can't protect you from HQ's abuse.
- Quarterly/Yearly evaluation algorithm doesn't promote good work ethics; rather, it creates hostile environment.
- Dev/QA teams claim to practice ""Agile"" methodologies, but their process is not industrial-standard. It's more like modern-world slavery.

As a QA engineer:
- You are forced to work even if you are sick. Taking sick-leave is extremely frowned upon. I've observed several illnesses caused by excessive work load: miscarriage, herniated disc, etc.
- Company or the department does not care for your career growth.
- Terrible management or lack of management. All high-up tasks passes through and trickles down to engineers. All high level communications, risk assessment, and risky decisions are up to engineers. This leaves engineers vulnerable for scapegoating.
- Even though all QA members are overpaid, the money does not properly compensate the amount of stress and strain on your body.
- If you can somehow endure this horrible place and brown-nose your way up to manager position, then it's the most over-paid, easy, and mindless job in the world.","QA department needs complete overhaul.

Great brand for resume and you work with good and intelligent people. Operating in multiple sectors of the consumer electronics industry means Samsung will always be a strong player. Strong worldwide business network, proven track record and strong drive to increase global share is what keeps this company alive.","The company is very top heavy. Expect very long nights and almost zero respect for your paid time off or weekends. That in itself is not horrible, many companies act this way, but the unclear standards for what constitutes good performance and promotions being highly political is a huge drawback.

Almost 90% of decisions are made in Korea - Directors/VP's here do not have any real decision making power but are in fact, expensive email routers.

The longer you stay, the more you realize that it is difficult to increase your portfolio of skills as the company is reporting based heavy. Employees lament on lack of development opportunities and mentors.

HR is suspicious of its people, cares little for organizational feed back - you will also be hard pressed to find any feedback from your manager as well.

Sink or Swim.",More transparency into performance standards - being chained to your desk doesn't mean you are a top contributor. Samsung needs a vision for its own competitive advantage and success instead of simplistically trying to out do or match competitors.,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

You are safe if your team is Asian or korean (you have more information on what is going on at the company, which will literally save or destroy your life). If you are familiar with Asian work culture, then you will be suitable. Lunch is also subsidized (but the menu is usually the same).","Many if you are American (I am Asian-American), but do NOT join an American team. You will be accountable for all the wrong information and lack of communication between HQ and Americans, and HQ will not hesitate to blame mistakes your team made. Be prepared to not further make mistakes on your team, or you will pay the price at risk of employment. It is a blame game here, people are on your team constantly lie to protect themselves, even people you directly work with or might be friendly with- and I wonder if they'd still be dishonest when facing HQ directly. As I am the only Asian-American on my team (unfortunately), the director and the rest of the Americans perpetually displace their frustrations on you- which is inconsistent and unethical. I am in touch (personally) with people from HQ, and it is shocking how huge the disconnect is between these cultures. This might be an American thing for validation, but sorry, HQ does not care what your ideas are. If your team is American, it is not important to HQ's overarching needs- and be prepared to be at risk of being cut without notice. There are many people who have been here at least 5 years, but have not been promoted since because they are not korean (nor do they wish to adapt to the Korean culture or learn their language). And don't even bother joining any ""Analytics"" team- 30 percent will be some Excel monkey job (and don't count on your data to be right because the infrastructure is not there/constantly broken, or due to lack of communication, is just plain wrong), and 70 percent doing administrative things the business or product teams can do. I have had bad experiences at previous jobs in the past, but have never been so compelled to leave such a negative review for a company). Finally, you know it's really bad when HR's fake positive review from Sep 30, 2015 is the first viewed by default and has stayed up at the top since.","Don't keep Americans if you will not tell them the information or want to deal with their egos for validation.

This makes your job infinitely harder. There is a significant lack of top down executive support; mentoring, leadership, and collaboration in this company. Korean HQ overrides everything-so be prepared to have something voted down in the 9th hour that you spent 9 months working on because it's a best practice that will move the company forward. YOu'll likely be forced to take 3 steps back. Most of your colleagues put on a happy face, but they are miserable and you will all talk about it every day until each one of you finally starts looking for jobs.

This is not a place to do any of that unfortunately. I feel like top management has an idea that they are participating in SV culture by being physically placed here, and having a gym (more to say they have a gym than anything) etc., but it couldn't be further from the truth. It's a very heartless organization that cuts people constantly. People are not to be trusted. Because of the pervasive fear, there is a complete lack of trust. Lack of guidance and protection from managers. You'll be floating out there by yourself. People who get ahead are sadly sycophantic yes-men or yes-women who get by more out of social relationships and acquiescence to the pathetic egotistical culture than out of any self respect.

Everyone I worked with left, and the people who stay are having an experience of just getting through it. Basically you can't expect this job to make you happy.

I know you're human and you don't want to treat people the way you do. But it is creating suffering for yourself and everyone around you. Remember the people who work for you are human beings just like you.

My advice to everyone working there is to try and have compassion. Many of the people around you are probably suffering and feel depressed.

- It is not a multi-national company. It is a a Korean company, and one could even suggest it is a nationalized conglomorate. --huge, on a group basis, it is involved in every industry stretgic to S. Korea's national concern. Make no mistake, it is run from Korea, with Korean dispatchers deployed at external subsidiaries to shadow. As a non-Korean, there is no hope of company leadership beyond a few installed figureheads local market heads to provide a defensible counter argument, and of curse to sell-in Samsung product at the local market level.

Even when they are successful, they are told it wasn't good enough. Good pay and benefits/perks.","When hired, I was told I would help shape strategy and decision making for the products I was working on. That was so far from the truth. There is an inherent lack of trust from Korea and they never believe they're wrong when there is a conflict in opinion on how to proceed. Oftentimes, you will reach agreement on something, only to come in the next morning to find out your Korean ""dispatchers"" have changed course during the night after you left the office. This goes even as far as forecasts to be manually changed in the system by the Koreans without your knowledge or agreement. Also, Korean culture is all about shaming you as a means of motivation. As if you'll do better in the future to hope not being talked down to like that again. However, as noted above - even when you do hit numbers or are successful, they'll be upset that you didn't exceed what you achieved. If you can deal with this kind of culture, you'll do well (and, frankly, some people do). But many people come and are gone in 3-6 months. Funny thing is most people measure your time there in ""dog years""....if you've made it a year, it's like working for 7 years at most other companies. That was the funniest thing I heard while working there - because it's true.","Not much advice, because Korean management won't accept it. However - for US based management.

The benefits are also good.
This place is known for an efficient top-down execution. All resources move on the queue from the someone above. When you have the political leverage, you can reign in your favor whatever position you may be.","Where do I start...
- Your non-Korean boss probably have a limited say in things whatever her/his title may be. It's run by the Koreans, especially those in finance. They place an American leadership to be the spearhead and also to be the scapegoat when things go south. The finance team communicates the most with HQ and they decide on everything what this American subsidiary can do. If lucky, HQ will be lenient for your pet projects so that you can get your paycheck and that's exactly how they think.
- No stock options, so be strategic when negotiating the salaries.
- You better deliver something in a year or two. That's the duration of the contracts of VPs or above, so you are being pushed to do something.
- But most of your projects will most likely get killed in any stage of the development. (You may get promoted as a consolation if your projects get killed for no reason however.)
- Samsung prefers to hire outsource and hire contractors over hiring full-time employees. They think it adds to flexibility, but it actually adds to the culture that cuts are coming; which is actually happening every quarter.
- The Koreans belittles you when they talk in Korean. Made me think of how Japanese used only sticks to flog the American captives during WWII and felt good about themselves.
- Slow. Everything is slow. Budget approval often takes months, by then, the market requirements already have changed. They have this thing called PUMI, which is supposed to be a documentation method for operational needs/budget uses, but it takes weeks to get approved, if lucky. And there is no logic in its rejection or approval. So you have to be political.
- They hire Koreans and keep them whether they can do work or not. You don't have to have the fitting background or capabilities to get hired if you speak Korean. And they use the unfitting background as a leverage to give lower salaries to the Koreans. Koreans in general are paid less compared to the Americans.
- Frequent changes in the top management... Going nowhere.
- Set up a gym and opened a cafeteria, and told people we take care of you... You still have to pay 50% of the food you buy, and haven't had Christmas party or any outing events for a while with decreasing sales and profits.
- There is only work, no work-life balance. Your PTO requests gets rejected, scrutinized, and you get called during your time offs. Sure, someone took 2 week vacation, then people will talk about it with envy for weeks.","Think long term, and think about culture.

Maternity leave is only 1 week of full pay and then it's simply the state mandate of short-term disability. Samsung has terrible short-term disability benefits! In addition, there is no work-life balance. People complain about strain with their spouse and children all the time... more so than the typical company. Samsung will never truly go out of their way to care about their people because the Korean HQ mentality is people are disposable. People should be dying to work for Samsung. Well, this is America and people run your company. For people still looking to develop professionally, Samsung is also not the place for you.

Do not dismiss the common themes in the CONS section from other reviews. I have never worked in such a NEGATIVE environment before. Most people are miserable and hate their leadership. In a six month timeframe I saw more people cry on the job than I had in my entire career! The Koreans micromanage everything and will never be satisfied. They constantly have knee jerk reactions based mostly on a lack of understanding which then causes many to waste their time answering useless questions and preparing useless reports to explain instead of doing your job.

There is very little regard for work/life balance. It is more important to be seen at 7 or 8pm at night rather than effectively managing your time throughout the day so you can leave at a respectable hour. Plus leaders have poor time management skills and lack respect for your own schedule and calendar. Employees & leaders are constantly having to reschedule meetings last minute or skip them altogether (including candidate interviews) because it is either frowned upon to leave their current meeting or most don’t respect your time or don’t care. Candidates interviewing for a job are often left to wait 30 – 45 minutes, or longer, past their scheduled interview and sometimes the manager is a no show all together. What kind of message does that send to a prospective employee?

In 2014 nearly 90% of the HR Business Partner team literally quit within a 6 week timeframe and yet no one at the C-Level ever thought to question HR leadership! Turnover within in HR is horrendous because there are two leaders who do what they are told, have little actual leadership skills, and don’t understand US laws. They literally blocked recruiters from moving forward with Asian candidates because headquarters in Korea told them not to hire any more Koreans or Asians. This is obviously an illegal practice here in the U.S., but not one HR leader even questioned the direction from Corporate HQ in Korea.

Neither the company nor leadership cares to provide any development of their employees under a Director level. And they do not promote internal movement as evident of only 12% of positions filled by internal employees in 2014.

This company requires followers, not people who are drivers or individuals who question how things have always been done in hopes of improving process or quality of service. The company overall, mostly driven by the Koreans, have an elitist attitude that everyone wants to work for Samsung. And they turn their back on good candidates who are from what they deem to be “lesser” companies or those considering a competitive offer from someone else. What they don’t understand is there are over a 1000 different companies in the U.S. that can be considered at the top in their respective fields and high performing employees can come from anywhere.

I would not recommend this company to even my worst enemy! If there was an option to give zero stars or 1/2 star to Senior Management or overall rating I would.",Question your HR leadership! Why have so many talented people quit within the HR function. Most employees are truly passionate about their own functional expertise and if leadership can just get out of the way and allow them to do their job by supporting them and instill a level of confidence instead of constantly telling them how to do their job this will allow people to be creative and the company can truly be a worldwide leader.,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,,

This could include working overtime on a daily basis, and putting a lot of effort into the smallest things - like making a PowerPoint presentation look beautiful when you know it's just a waste of time.

There is a constant sense of existential angst and a sense of (false) urgency about everything needing to be done yesterday.

Work revolves around creating presentations for executives who visit (seemingly with little advanced warning) in the hopes of convincing them that you, your project and/or your team are relevant to the business.

Executives make the biggest decisions based on the smallest input/data...and so often it seems like they're just going with their gut. Information is held back and used as power over people, ""If you had the information I had, you'd see that I was right.""

Too often, we toss out what is right to do for what is faster to achieve. In the end, you get people who are confused and frustrated about what they are working on, who tackle their tasks with daily ambivalence and ship things neither they nor the customer will care about.

Deep pockets mean a very competitive salary with great benefits. This will remain the strongest reason for sticking around with Samsung Mobile.

Great HQ support means US-based Samsung Mobile employees are able to focus on their work without having to worry if R&D is following up on requests.","Unfortunately deep pockets also mean you are considered to be replaceable.

Great HQ support is reciprocal - they will expect you to also share the work ethics in Suwon, which can be difficult for many with many personal sacrifices having to be made.

2014-11-03, Senior Marketing Manager,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",Current Employee ,Good opportunities if you're self motivated and adaptable.,More than 3 years,0,"I've been with the company for 4 years, coming from a background in a smaller organization so the large corporate environment was a significant adjustment for me. I have met some amazing people, very intelligent, hard working, driven and team oriented. The culture is extremely fast paced and ideal for those that are self starters and able to quickly adapt to change. The most successful are those that are able to take complete ownership of their work and can be accountable for the successes and failures of their team. Someone who is capable of seeing great opportunity in what others may see as insanely aggressive goals and expectations can thrive with this company. Executive leaders are very approachable and encourage entrepreneurial minds.","Work-life balance is always a challenge with demanding work hours and, depending on the role, quite a bit of travel, evening communications w/ HQ and often times weekend work to stay on top of the workload. There are plenty of training opportunities (some mandatory), but they are often not completely relevant to the individual's business needs (most often the case in B2B as Samsung is very consumer oriented), which can be frustrating. Finding a clear career path can be nearly impossible even when you proactively try to find one, limiting the hope of a glass ceiling. While executive management may be very approachable and competent (certainly a positive), it is very obvious that HQ has a significant lack of trust in local leadership (this is a global issue, not just the US) and limits the amount of 'control' those leaders have over their own businesses and employees. As much as an entrepreneurial mindset may be encouraged, the downside is that the process-heavy culture does not always enable the execution of the ideas created. In addition, Korean dispatchers are very focused on 'leaving their mark' on the business for short periods of time, which often results in disruption of business on a 2-4 year cycle that often deters those that see the potential for a long term career with the company.","The biggest challenge for Samsung is the HQ-driven desire to force the Korean culture and mindset into a workforce with a very different background, set of beliefs and career expectations. When you research the difference between Korean culture and many others, it is easy to understand the 'how' and 'why', but it would be prudent for our Korean leaders to utilize their own business strength in 'adaptability' and apply it to their global business leadership styles. Find trust in your local leaders and empower them to drive their respective businesses without being stifled by unnecessary HQ-driven demands, redundant processes and HQ's lack of local market intricacies.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0
