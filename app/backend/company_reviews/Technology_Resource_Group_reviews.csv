Technology Resource Group (COIT Consulting) not giving salaries, full and final and did not pay the taxes for the employees.
They are not willing to pay anything whomsoever joined the organization.
They do not have policy to pay the incentives.
They always make the incentive policies only, when It comes to release the incentives they do not do.
They do not pay to the employers.
So many consultants have worked for TRG Inc. through their clients and they did not pay to those consultants for more than a year.
So many cases are on Technology Resource Group Inc.
They have made other companies i.e 9ine Consulting, Tech-Aug, Teregro
Now they want to shut down all and file a bankruptcy. They will change a signing authority and will do business with the same clients and run.
