Only the building of the company can seem to be quite appealing to you but DONOT GET BE FOOLED.

I wish Glassdoor had Negative rating as well. Giving 1 rating to such companies is also way too more than they actually deserve.

Technology Resource Group (COIT Consulting) not giving salaries, full and final and did not pay the taxes for the employees.
They are not willing to pay anything whomsoever joined the organization.
They do not have policy to pay the incentives.
They always make the incentive policies only, when It comes to release the incentives they do not do.
They do not pay to the employers.
So many consultants have worked for TRG Inc. through their clients and they did not pay to those consultants for more than a year.
So many cases are on Technology Resource Group Inc.
They have made other companies i.e 9ine Consulting, Tech-Aug, Teregro
Now they want to shut down all and file a bankruptcy. They will change a signing authority and will do business with the same clients and run.
Most important thing even on Glassdoor they update on a regular basis to avoid negativity. This way people look positive side of Technology Resource Group Inc. however it is not exactly.
