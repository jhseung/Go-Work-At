During my years of service to Chameleon there was no room for advancement. Possibly in other departments there is but in IT there wasn't.

Not going to keep going but hopefully those who read these reviews get a good look and feel to the culture and environment.","Chameleon keeps getting these negative reviews because of the way Chameleon has treated people that have worked there.

2017-09-05,,"Novi, MI",Former Employee ,Chop Shop,Chop Shop,0,"It's a paycheck. That's all it is, and that isn't even worth the hassle.","Owner is a scammer. This guy changes the name of these companies as he pursues various ventures that usually all end up imploding due to his arrogant attitude and poor management skills. The review beneath this one speaking on an employee being fired, that's the owner of the company. As you can see from this slick review recommending his own company and silencing reviews on here should tell you pretty much everything you need to know about the state of the operation currently underway.

This guy will break laws, yank employee benefits at the last second without notice, will not entertain you for raises of any kind regardless of the quality of work you put in, nor will comply with licensing or safety standards of any kind. If you do anything that falls under 'things we do not like' with these guys, upon resigning or termination they will deliberately hold your last paycheck making you go through local licensing and regulatory offices to fight for it. Integrity? ZERO.

Stay away from this place and save yourself the hassle of working for an unethical scam artist like this guy and his cronies.","Sell the company, never involve yourself with matters involving people, ever.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
