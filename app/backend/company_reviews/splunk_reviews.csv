They offer you a decent amount of equity when you start","I’m almost 200% of plan YTD, I’m the only one on my team that’s over quota, so this review should really make you think twice about this company (everything this company does is for the short term)

If you could buy most of the Sales Mgmt team for what they’re worth and sell them for what they THINK they’re worth, you’d be rich!

It’s a company that thrives on breaches and compelling events to sell its products, that’s it - plain and simple

If you’re not selling to (massively) large accounts - that have a bunch of internal Splunk expertise - you will fail! The Field segment ($500M to $4B) and Commercial segment (under $500M) are dying yet Mgmt keeps throwing more reps at the problem - because they don’t care about the Individual Contributors!

The Sales Org and Sales Leadership are massively screwed up - they are trying to implement the SFDC go to market model with a technology that is very technical and not a necessity but a luxury for many customers

The Mgmt Review Board (MRB) - most ppl within Splunk have no clue about this Board, which is only referenced in the T&C’s - have full and wide ranging/limitless authority to change anything they want at anytime - pulling back already earned commissions, deciding who is making too much money if they are doing well with quota attainment, implementing policies that weren’t announced to the field or implemented at beginning of FY that have severe consequences on your ability to earn commission, etc

They changed the Club trip qualifications 6 months into the fiscal year",CEO needs to clean the Sales Leadership house before the company implodes - the current Mgmt team is yet another example of sales reps being promoted to Mgmt not because they are qualified (or will be good leaders) but because the company believes it’s a logical progression - current reps also know that Mgmt is chock full of “establishment” types that are there simply waiting it out until they can sell those RSU’s,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

Best onboarding in the business thanks to some really solid people (and former employees) that have blended together the best of the former BMC/PTC (MEDDPIC) methodology with ""Challenger"", Sandler and other best of breed sales methodologies.

Some literally amazing case studies with customers. Truly groundbreaking business outcomes enabled by differentiated software.

Great pay, benefits, stock options, and in general some of the best people out there.

Diversified technology - you can literally sell to anyone across an enterprise organization, from finance, to IT, to security, to operations.","So you've just gotten done reading the Pros and are saying - sign me up!! You should give it a try - maybe you'll be one of the lucky (or chosen) ones. Here are the cons from someone who didn't make it (and btw it's not because of lack of talent, effort, or intangibles - I have the performance reviews and additional unexcersized stock equity awards to prove it - so don't even try to rationalize that argument). With Splunk, it's all about the accounts. Good accounts in strong financial health with dynamic IT leadership? You're good. Everything else? Good luck with that.

1. Politics. You think our current government has issues? The white house has NOTHING on Splunk. The nepotism, favoritism, and flat out backstabbing is like an episode of House of Cards on steroids. The worst part is the main actors in this play pretend they are doing it for the greater good of the company - and they have most people fooled. Until you see through them and then watch out. Accounts are handed out not based on merit, but like a sick game of pin the tail on the donkey while intoxicated. Some tenured reps are taken care of - others are stabbed in the eye. No rhyme or reason. For a data analytics company, the way accounts are doled out is laughable. This leads to a cohort of reps who are 300+%, while others starve, selling to bankrupt companies that were assigned to them (true story). Some reps are given a choice, others are ""bought off"" with more RSUs to just keep shoveling coal in the furnace while the chosen are strutting above deck sipping martinis.

2. The technology is an overpriced data analytics development platform that requires very solid practitioners in each account to make it successful. Most of your time is spent grooming these champions - when you do it well and get an account off the ground, it is usually pulled from you and given to another rep with more tenure. See #1.

3. I know several former reps who have needed serious counseling after working here. When account assignments and financial success are not correlated with effort or talent like it is at most meritocracies, it really screws with your head. It will take you quite some time to get over working here if you don't make it. Be advised.

4. Micromanagement. The SFDC culture that has taken root will ask you for deal updates every hour. Not kidding. Management likes to sit behind a desk and run SFDC reports - they are not concerned with your individual goals or aspirations. At all.

5. Be careful who you trust and confide in. See #1.

Final thought. I have never worked somewhere that I loved and hated in equal amounts at the same time. This place is really screwed up. My advice - if you know someone really well who is hiring you or referring you in, you'll probably be ok. If not - take a look at the accounts you are assigned in your first year. It is only going to get worse from there my friend. So if you start with crap, don't expect that your attitude and hard work will get you anything. The only thing that will matter is if one of those crap accounts has a breach and suddenly they open their checkbook. You look like a hero but it's total chance. Then maybe you'll get trusted with a better account the following year.",Do us all a favor and just call a spade a spade. Everyone can see thru your BS.,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0

1. Close down the quirky, fun SF Splunk office and move everyone next door to an oddly decorated, cold, non-Splunky environment.
2. Hire a CRO, now President, and let her make terrible hires after she promised on her first day she would not change the Splunk culture.
3. Let said hires come in and make very bad decisions and get rid of really good people.
4. Let HR fire people for caring and trying to speak up. Let HR continue to ignore glaring issues going on across departments.
5. Hire the completely WRONG SVPs of marketing and products who have no clue how to manage and that no one respects
6. Try to force people work in the Santana Row office (also cold, bare and not Splunky and not close to a train station)
7. Try to turn Splunk into a mini Salesforce (no one wants this!)

10. Only care about getting to $5B","Splunk used to be my dream job. And the same for my many colleagues who have also recently left and those are are gearing up to leave.

You’re “in the cool crowd” (usually orbiting a couple old-timers or part of the CEO’s entourage), or you’re not. If you’re not with the in-crowd, chances are, you’re pretty miserable here. I was hired with a few other senior leaders and told not to “bother anyone with questions”. We were compared to babies and actively segregated apart from the ‘original team’ - and all of us have since left. My experiences were so outrageous and unprofessional that I walked away from a humongous sum of money, just so I could feel valued and feel excited about what I was doing again. It’s a decision I’m proud of...","Watch who you promote or put in positions of leadership. Most are only out for themselves (and it’s barely even hidden). They are not trying to do what’s best for the company, but what’s best for themselves from a career advancement point of view. Watch your blind spots too. C-staff- you have too many close friends who coincidentally land plum senior jobs under you. If it’s not outright nepotism, it certainly looks and feels that way. Finally, take stock of who you’ve lost. Some of us are top of our field, but couldn’t abide in your environment. Reflect on that.",1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0

Talking and grandstanding is valued over actually getting things done. Every meeting is a chance for people to put on a show and play politics. A typical meeting is about 3+ managers/directors talking about what work needs to be done and one (if lucky two) engineer who will actually do the work. Politics at the manager level is brutal where everyone is fighting for headcount, and managers try to quietly poach top performers (even though they aren't supposed to). Teams dislike each other and think they are the only ones overworked while everyone else is lazy/incompetent.

Executives are dishonest about what is going. They claim they want to attract world class talent yet average compensation has been going down year after year. They claim Splunk is an engineering/products company, but look at the actual investments (public financial statements) in R&D/engineering vs. sales/marketing. They claim we are doing well and finances are great, yet perks and amenities are going away (reduction in health insurance benefits, can't even order enough food on free lunch Mondays for everyone, soda machines broken for months, minimum years required for new laptops increasing).

- IT team that is vastly behind on technology
- Technology that from the outside looks amazing, but up close very dated. Many technologies being used have not been the industry best practice for well over 6 years.
- Management and architects that don’t want change. No matter how bad the decision was, they will stand by it
- Managers that will backstab you in a second to push off blame
- None of the management can agree
- Everything is about politics, not technology.
- Revolving door of employees, especially managers. They are hiring fast, but they have severally lowered the bar. Promotions not to the ones who are best suited, but the ones people like the most. Even if that means they produce nothing. They are ""easy to get along with"".
- Meetings, all day long
- ERDs and over documenting new ideas with no prototype. Prototypes are discouraged.
- Next to no testing automation. 100% code coverage with tests that do nothing.
- Super slow development, the worst I have ever seen. Projects are delayed by many many months.
- In my 3+ years there, not a single project was completed on time.","You are beyond fixing, the company is a sinking ship. Vest and get out. The former CEO left at the right time, he knew the best days of Splunk are very far behind. The new CEO is awful.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

* Legal leadership lacks sense of humour - srsly, lacks sense of humour.
* Splunk moves fast. People, projects, budgets, small dogs and children get run over. The underlying issues are not addressed in favour of whatever is most expedient at the time. Short-sighted leadership. Whatcha gonna do? Grow, grow, grow, never fix, fix, fix. Make it someone else's problem. Not a terribly unique problem in the industry.
* IT needs some drastic TLC and not a little bit of therapy. I think someone somewhere will need to grow a pair and just say No, like Nancy Reagan. No.","Upper management, stop visiting chat@ - you're not going to have a good time. Or if you do, then absorb the vibe and either use it or chuck it; do NOT reply. It's like replying to a YouTube comments thread - you're not going to win.

Middle management needs more support - ie. if you're going to make someone manage people and/or projects or resources, what have you, give them the tools and skillset to do so rather than just say ""Hey! Go manage now!"" They do not ""just figure it out"". They really don't.

Generous with bonuses and RSU: Bonuses are given out every quarter and another bigger chunk of bonus at the end of fiscal year

Extremely friendly environment: Parties for almost all occasions and events

Extremely generous with spot bonuses: High motivation to get things done goes along well with more bonuses

Extremely well with retention: This is a place that has a very low attrition rate

Liberal with promotion: Just like what the people from HR will tell you - always talk to your manager. That is so true! Just make sure that you constantly talk to your manager about your goals.

Extremely well balanced work-life workplace: Don’t worry about working long hours because it’s all about work-life balance. You can expect a laid-back environment here.

Be careful that your role is in an appropriate group, and be willing to be very assertive about getting what you need to succeed.

Amazing support and customer on boarding team

Amazing marketing team

Great energy","While Splunk is a great product, there is much to be desired in terms of software engineering maturity and accountability. Some of the biggest issues with Splunk that are a pain point for many

1. Many of the senior engineering staff have huge egos and are not really open to listening to new or fresh perspective.

2. Many engineers are afraid of speaking up and just go about doing their work. Compensation+Stock is great so why ruffle feathers

3. There is no way transparent way of doing performance reviews for your team. Reviews are done via email in an excel sheet. Because many are afraid of their managers, most don't say things that need to be said. I hope someone in Splunk HR reads this and implements one of the many solutions in the market for doing 360-reviews. Comeon guys, we can't be using excel and email in the year 2013 :)

4. No well defined engineering process and absolutely chaotic environment. Senior Engineering leads with huge egos for whom you can't really give a anonymous feedback are a big hurdle in doing the right thing.

5. Huge technical debt causing slower and riskier development. Again, people with big egos get in the way.

6. Little motivation to become agile and lean because of customer roll out cycles.","Great vision and product. Can't complain there.

Please take a look at the engineering management. Concerned engineers are dying to give feedback and make Splunk better but are afraid of their managers. Allow a way to solicit anonymous quarterly feedback and you will see the issues facing the team.

Basically this is pushing the experienced splunker to leave, and for new join, won't survive for 6 months. Before you ramp up, you are fired as you cannot meet linearity.

Useless Selling Process - Prospect need a solution but not a bunch of selling talk, BVC, DSA, IVA are all business talk while they are needed, you can't push the prospect to buy another 1TB just because of BVC, DSA result. Prospect won't enjoy these kind of conversation and pushing the sale team to do this is meaningless.

Endless Learning - This can be good or bad, for instance, you need to learn security operation including firewall, WAF, sysmon, IDS/IPS, OS event log...only for you to sell SIEM and all a sudden you need to speak different language of LTM, JVM, transaction logging for IT/App Monitoring, if you are lucky enough then you also need to talk about IoT, BA, ML...and please you need to understand a bunch of SPL to show the real value of Splunk. Is that a bit too much for a single SE to handle to build 100GB deal and then management bark at you on why you spend time on such a small deal and where is the M deal? what can you say..

Toxic Management - Everyone is just playing political stuff and not care about how to really make ""Customer Success"", what a joke when we said ""Customer Success"" is our top initiative...end up is, no big deal no talk.

Terrible CRO - All are numbers, where is CEO? seems just like few years ago in SKO, ""We are all working for her""..lol","If you believe you can GT5B with your Exec/Management team alone then keep what you are doing right now, soon you will pay for what you have done.

Almost a communist dictatorship, very approximative and evasive in terms of communication, they put themselves on top of the ""mass"" and really seem to be here to make some cash while it's time and get their friends hired.
2) Very poor level of training, and many incoherence concerning future structure.
3) I personally lost respect towards my direct report because of his behaviour.
I don't even know how and why he got this position.","Mr Sullivan, have a close review of the EMEA sales management team (incl. VP). Some managers and sales reps are more professional and should stop being under-estimated because those are the ones who understand Splunk, product and values.
Because when management does not make sense anymore, teams lose faith in them, in the company, and suddenly the stock drops.

4. Your successes are your own. Your ""areas of improvement"" are often snap judgement calls from peers that don't even know you. These perceived weaknesses will be broadcast wide to anyone that will listen, and will be held against you for the rest of your career at Splunk.
