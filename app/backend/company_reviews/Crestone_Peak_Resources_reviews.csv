Well capitalized from well matched investment group, and probably going to be around a few years given their position. Good healthcare. Comfortable work-life balance generally.","Organization isn't able to learn. See any business writeup for barriers to organizational learning for a description of Crestone. Long term incentive isn't. Org chart appears to be growing from top meaning no career growth. Leadership doesn't lead.

I suggest finding (ie. LinkedIn) someone who worked organizationally near to your role to make sure it's the kind of job you will stay at.","Recruiters have a lot of your employees resumes. As good opportunities appear, they're moving.",2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Good pay and benefits carried over during transition.","HR is nasty, spreads gossip and shares employee personal information. Most people donâ€™t want to be here. Huge disconnect and discontent between field and corporate. Failing the PR battle with the community. Depressing. A lot of good people planning to leave.",CEO please talk to your employees direct and find out what the problems are rather than relying on what your managers or HR are telling you.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
