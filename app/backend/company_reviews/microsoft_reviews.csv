2013-01-28,,"Redmond, WA",Current Employee ,Thoughts after 10 years....,More than 10 years,0,"1. If you love tech, this is a great place. No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2. What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations. If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher. 401k match is nice.

3. Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine. This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs. The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either. You'll get a bonus each year and some stock. It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume: After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career: Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there. Double that for vendors. It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company. Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too. Not familiar with the stack rank? Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade"".","I'll type it here - but I don't they are listening...
1. Help proven talent move laterally in the company for new opportunities.
2. Kill/evolve the stack rank. Here's basically how it's viewed:. 30% of the company gets 1s and 2s - and they are happy. 50% get 3s and that basically feels like getting a ""C"" in school. This sucks for talented people when a multitude of UNCONTROLLABLE conditions keep you from getting into 1 or 2 range. The 20% getting anything below a 3 are walking dead. In summary, 70% of the company walk away from the review cycle feeling like crap. This is no good.

After 10 years, I'm leaving - it's just a matter of time until I find the right opportunity. I need to find a company spends 90% of it's time building technology experiences, as opposed to 90% of its time building PowerPoints. And I expect to refuse the exit interview - because if you really cared what I thought, you wouldn't ask me after I decided to leave.",4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,

Like many other tech companies, there's a big emphasis on work-life balance and community building. In a lot of ways, it will feel like an extension of college in terms of the learning and events with other young professionals. Senior developers are, for the most part, very happy to mentor younger people and instill a sense of discipline. Internal mobility is fantastic as well, moving from team to team is relatively frictionless and it's Microsoft, so there's a team for almost any area you want to work in. There are so many resources that there's an expert for basically anything you want to know. There's tons of young professionals around too and Seattle is a great place to live. Pay is competitive with the other top companies at a junior level.

Exit opportunities are great here as well. If you pay attention and put effort into your work, you will come out with a brand name that recruiters all over want to see, as well as a disciplined, rigorous skill set to match.","As you move up in ranks, the pay disparity between Microsoft and its competitors (Google, Amazon, Facebook) starts to grow, with Microsoft developers making substantially less than their counterparts. For some, this is okay if they value lifestyle more than career progression. For others, it's common to jump ship to another company.

As with any other big company, there's layers and layers of bureaucracy. For most mature teams, all work will be carefully planned months in advance, specced, discussed in multiple team meetings, with dedicated PMs and testers. In the beginning this is good because it teaches the absolute best, gold standard way to develop large software. After a while, it can become very dull and repetitive though.

The annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. Even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based culture and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).

Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. Local team culture matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. Two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. Maybe the things I list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. Unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. You can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the culture though.

Despite this Microsoft is still a fantastic company, no regrets after having worked here for 6 years. The opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers to ship code that all modern versions of Windows use has been a privilege.",,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Comp plans for pre-sales technical staff not competitive with the market, which leads to gamesmanship like giving people who should be on Account Technology Specialist roles in Account Team Units (ATU) in Solutions Specialist (SSP) roles so they can make more money--that is a problem in my org and leads to dissension among technical specialists in the STU, who don't have the opportunity to be on Solution Specialist comp plans while not being accountable for opportunity ownership. Local leadership doesn't understand the problem that causes for morale and the sense that ATUs are ""more equal than others"", to quote Animal Farm.

That can lead to internal friction and some free-riding.","Clearly, Satya has done a masterful job of getting MS back on track by pursuing a very Buddhist-inspired cultural transformation (not fighting ""what is so"" and being authentic and humble). Satya isn't explicit about the Buddhist origins of his leadership, but those who know his background and family history can infer the influences. Satya has done a good job of selecting solid leaders at senior levels, but there is more work to do with mid-level managers (national subsidiary leadership and a few levels down; especially the legacy people who thrived under Kevin Turner). Cultural change is happening and my advice to Satya is to focus on culture forever.

Satya Nadella is a CEO that cares for himself and that is well known. He looks down at people that are not as smart as he is. He claims he is average person to people and dresses down for the new Microsoft look. The company has to hire women as they have to show that they are not discriminating. This is not a new trend but now a unwritten one where Women are given the promotion in order to show the world they do not discriminate. The company is political and only cares for the top executives who pass out favors to those that are buddies. They are fortunate not to be audited by the US government again for antitrust.,Be honest to potential hires. That men are not going to be selected over women as there is a deficit of women at the company. The company substituted one type of stack ranking for another.

* Even though the company is huge, I feel the org and teams are tightly connected. You come across familiar faces in the hallway multiple times a day, people nod their head or smile at you even though they may not know your name

* Benefits and pay may not be the best, but it's great given how many hours you put in. The 401k with 50% match (up to $9,250 in 2018), ESPP, HSA, etc are awesome and serve as a great vehicle for preparing for retirement (early).

- Easy Job
- Pays more than IBM
- Stress free in terms of physical labor
- Microsoft offers amazing benefits. My current benefit payout is 19.1k.
- Microsoft pays you back for fitness related items
- Workplace environment is relaxed
- Great starter job in the IT industry, I would recommend this job to people just starting out.","These are the Cons for Microsoft Datacenter:

- Does not pay nearly as much as Amazon or Oracle
- Job might be easy, but it's very linear. You will definitely need something to distract you from the boredom.
- Gossip and backstabbing is like wildfire in this particular location of Microsoft.
- Does not offer any holidays off at all, unless requested. And only 3 people per shift can get them off. Everyone else is stuck here on holidays. (upside you get double pay if working on holidays).
- People get hired here with subpar knowledge on how to do the work, which has caused a high turnover rate of talent.
- Very little to almost no career opportunities in terms of promotions. Most people have to move out, in order to move up. This also sorta ties into the talent having a higher turnover rate.
- Yearly pay raise is extremely low.","This is the Advice to Management for Microsoft Datacenter:

- More interpersonal skills with the employees. We would rather want to see you as someone who's actually out there working with the employees, or at least trying to relate to us, rather than sitting in an office all day behind closed doors doing email work. We run a data center, not an office building. We ALL should know how to do the work, not just the few of us.

You're encouraged to move around within the company to find a good fit--but you still have to go through a lengthy interview process with the new team each time.","Work/life balance seems to be slowly declining across the company. There are no QA teams anymore in most places (because quality is the devs' responsibility) but it's rare to find a team that is willing to allocate enough time to actually write sufficient tests. This makes it hard to write code at quality without just working extra hours.

Work flexibility is good if you are one of the mid-level management's favorite children. Some of my coworkers have ridiculous amount of vacation or out of office days.

Good benefits, the company takes care of its employees.

Opportunities to explore and employees are encouraged to move around inside the company although you must go through an interview process or a ""loop"". Given the size of the company, you will find a role truly excites you.

Nice and smart people to work with and to learn from.","Just want to claim that below is only witnessed in my org and not sure will be applicable to the whole company. But I'm sure certain patterns are the same across the board.

Politics or clique is a big issue at the company. The CEO is trying to change the company culture. However, you will find strong resistance to the change from many long-time employees. Some people managers are so fake and pretend to care about you. Instead, they will manipulate and twist messages to guard their jobs and step on your head for promotion. Backstabbing is common to benefit one's own career development.

Conversations are not inclusive, and communication is bad. When you are unfairly treated, there is no place for your voice to be heard or for you to be understood. If you try to explain, you will be regarded as too defensive and not willing to embrace the growth mindset. When there's misunderstandings, basically my manager told me to shut up in a polite way. I also have been shut down multiple times by senior employees when I tried to help them understand things on a project.

Mid-level management don't know how to create clarity. They will use big and vague words to sound smart, but they cannot explain themselves when you ask follow up questions for details or clarification.

Talents have been leaving the team constantly and no one from management has any interest to investigate. Instead, they think that they are nurturing talents for the company. Some senior employees who stayed don't even know how to use our own technology.",,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Outside of that, the company hosts many events for the employees and their families, the food is decently priced, and there are many on-campus services, from tech support, barbershops, live music, farmer's markets, happy hours, and more. The work/life balance is top-notch for a company that has so much on their plate.

3. Hierarchy is surprisingly flat in many parts of the company.

This is true at most companies, and it's certainly true here. If you get along with your immediate manager, you will find your time here tolerable.","1. MS keeps dogfooding its products on employees and moving people around: both re-orgs and office moves. The company has an optimizing culture that neglects its effects on humans. Then they try to compensate in the worst way possible: corporate initiatives. Growth mindset, inclusivity, etc. They'll put up posters and send out emails that people just ignore or mock.
2. They are gradually converting offices to open space.
3. Tons of politics. Much of the old guard feel obligated to justify their employment; they attempt to ""own"" as much as possible, usually to the detriment of projects and the mental health of individual contributors.

Looks really good on my resume now",Every other aspect that one could imagine. Please see advice to management.,"I worked at Microsoft this summer as an intern in Bellevue. I’m writing this with a friend who also worked at Microsoft. He didn’t find out his commute would be an hour an a half each way every day until the first day of work, and he did not have a car. One fun thing was during my summer, everyone moved floors, except for me and three other interns. So for 6 weeks of the summer, I was literally alone on the floor, without an office or any adults to talk to. It was as if they forgot we existed. My boss came into work maybe 10 times over the course of the summer. It was considered a “fun” and “different” day if he was there! I personally felt very underutilized, having little to no work to do every day. My friend also had a project that took him 4 weeks to complete (the internship is 12 weeks), and 3 of those weeks were spent trying to get people to respond to emails.

Fast forward to the school year after. I emailed my recruiter and my former boss telling them of my upcoming plans to not return due to this experience and wish to be literally anywhere else on this earth next summer. It was a nice email, well-intentioned. Neither of them responded to me. It baffles me that everyone at the company makes literally no effort to capture and retain talent. At a dinner I had with my recruiter, he literally said: “We just can’t compete with Facebook or Google” in regards to recruiting anyone. Maybe you could if you made any effort, like responding to my emails or making it seem like an interesting place to work, or giving me work when you are paying me.

But it was fun to be in Seattle! I met my current lover there. Also work had free drinks (but nothing else). If you are looking for a job where you have to do next to nothing and get paid lots for it (aren’t we all), Microsoft is the place for you! Personally, I have ambition.",2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0

2018-11-23,,,Current Employee ,The best thing I can say is it is not the worst job I have had or worst company I have worked at.,More than 3 years,0,A lot of work from home opportunities and access to education even though most of it is selling propaganda unless you are in a highly technical role. Good benefits. Great matching on 401k and charitable contributions. Working with smart people. Saying you work for Microsoft.,"You truly have to enjoy politics to work here. This company is more about popularity than productivity.

Hierarchical, deep rooted long term relationships and loyalties in teams make it hard for new employees to be successful.

If you think you are here for the exciting technology you are fooling yourself. You must love Powerpoint and Excel to work at Microsoft. You will spend 90% of your time building and finding decks and spreadsheets unless you are in a developer type role.

Microsoft sales teams are only customer focused when it's renewal or sales time. After the renewal, if it doesn't make them money they do not care.

Our customers use our technology more than we do. We are just beginning to fully implement Microsoft Teams almost a full year after our customers have struggled with it.

Our internal systems are awful. Our vast IP is in so many places and so difficult to find you will spend days trying to find a Powerpoint Deck. Trying to find a internal resource is even more difficult.

Partners still rule and the Services Group is the red headed step child of the organization. Avoid being employed on the Services side of Microsoft if you want a long term career. Services will never hit their numbers and are considered to be a drain on the organization as a whole.

The leadership is also lackluster and out of touch. They are so concerned with promoting women, due to a recent lawsuit, they are promoting incapable women in positions they are not qualified for. I am a woman and while I appreciate the change in Microsoft's position on hiring women, they belittle me when they hire women not because they are the best candidate but because the need to make their numbers. More women suffer under their poor leadership than succeed because of a hiring quota percentage.","My best advice is to start over. About 20% of the leadership is qualified and capable to lead and about 80% of your employees want another job inside or outside of Microsoft. You have a problem but because Microsoft makes so much money, essentially they are a cash printing machine, on licenses it will continue to be swept under the rug.

Honestly I don't know how anything actually gets done here. Maybe some teams are more stable, but my experience is one of constant re-orgs.

It's no accident that many of the best people I know have left for other companies such as Facebook and Google: the constant re-orgs are terrible for morale, and compensation at Microsoft isn't competitive anyway, so as long as people's projects are getting cut, it makes sense that they would look elsewhere.

Management needs to bring compensation up to par with Facebook/Google, unless the goal is really to only keep the mediocre talent and purge the high performers. Also please stop changing priorities and reshuffling the executives every quarter. Focus.

- Compensation and benefits are generous
- It's a family friendly company if you're at that stage in your life and want to slow down
- The company is financially stable ( for now )","- The ratio of PMs to engineers is ridiculous. There are only a handful of engineers for every PM in my org. Our backlog keeps growing, while the features with the best ""visibility"" and the least amount of investments gets resourced.

- Many of the PMs are non-technical. They've landed this job due to dumb luck, then wonder why the over-worked engineers can't get this done faster. When work items take longer than expected, IC PMs are pressed to ask them to ""work faster"".

- The more talented people at the company leave. Those who stay are the ones who can't get jobs with similar pay elsewhere. Those who stay and take on work with great ""visibility"" great promoted. This means that product planning tends to be short sited. Seniors only want to work on something they can get done before the next review period.

- It's getting more difficult to recruit. PMs are joining in increasing numbers from non-technical domains. They may have domain knowledge in the space, but they're not engineers. This is going to exasperate the problems I mentioned above.

- Upper management is very disconnected from the reality of building software in the modern age. Most of them haven't touched code in decades, or have been around since the early days of the Internet. They think we are a first-class engineering company, yet we don't have real time metrics, continuous deployment, technical debt controls, testing...

- Not agile, despite at the rhetoric.

- We're so much on building a culture around everything except having a great software engineering team.","- Stop hiring unqualified people
- Promote new college hires - WITH TECHNICAL CHOPS - faster to management positions so the company can be saved before it's too late
- Understand what you're building before you start
- Admit to each other that we are not the cream of the crop in terms of talent and ability. Try to come up with a plan to compete under those conditions.

Steady paycheck. Great medical benefits.,"- The amount of time spent in Powerpoint is egregious. STOP wasting so much time “telling the story” and build some freakin’ customer centric features.

- Program management is not product management. They literally don’t have the modern product skill set. They have a project management/timeline based skill set and therefore, it needs to be handed over to UX immediately.

- Engineering has little accountability. Once a year, on every team, it becomes clear that engineering is taking their sweet time and using technical obfuscation (everyone else’s lack of tech stack knowledge) to buy more time.

- Engineering has WAY too much input on experiences which they have no expertise in. I can’t tell you how many devs I have had to “convince” to do the right thing for customers. I appreciate collaboration, but devs are in a role to help execute the strategies of UX and product management, they don’t need to have input into the strategy, just the tech efficiencies within it...because you aren’t qualified or empathetic enough to do so.

- Once you become a senior, suddenly just being great at your job is not good enough and in order to receive any small portion of your already peanut sized bonuses, you will be expected to go “above & beyond” your role and will be viewed as an under performer if you don’t. It’s insane that a 100k person company would expect anyone to stand-out. It is a waste of time, just reward people for doing their jobs well and leave people alone.","- Take product ownership out of the hands of program management OR begin product management training for everyone of them...because most of your PM’s are project managers, not product managers. They literally don’t have the modern product skill set, so they either need to be taught it or it needs to be handed over to UX.

- Engineers need to culturally be shifted to a support role. No more “blocking until they approve”, they are to execute on behalf of the customer & user experience strategy teams - with input on tech efficiencies, not “what engineering thinks customers want”.",2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0
