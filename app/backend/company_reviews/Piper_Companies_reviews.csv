Good recruiting tools are made available to you. More importantly, if you request new tools the leadership team, Directors/VPs/Managers of Delivery, actually listen and try to implement them. At a minimum, the tool will be evaluated against the current list of available tools.
The company cares about improving its culture and improving the working situation of the people that work here.
Once you prove your capability, you are allowed a high degree of autonomy, the company encourages empowerment and entrepreneurship in their employees.
 How you're treated is directly proportional to the amount of effort as well as how well you are doing against your goals. For me, this is meritocracy in pure form. There is always some degree of bias and subjectivity involved, but by and large if you put in the work, you are rewarded for that.","It is still staffing; so there is nothing you can really change about hiring managers/candidates being fickle or lying or changing their mind (or the other thousand ways a req can go South).
Again, it is still staffing, so there are ebbs and flows to the amount of time that you need to put into the job (i.e., work-life balance). So yes, work-life balance can be a challenge for those that are not able to create boundaries and set their own limits. The job requires as many hours as you allow it to.

-Turnover is extremely high, so the people that are dedicated to the business and stick through tougher times, have to train and retrain employees, which takes away from their overall production
-There is a lack of empathy and willingness to work with employees through tough weeks, months and sometimes quarters if they are dedicated to the business and sometimes have already proven their work ethic; not everyone is perfect and when you turn your back on an employee that is truly invested in your company they will not want to stay; someone may lose a big client, or be going through something personal at home.

-Trying to fit individuals into a mold of what they think the ""ideal"" recruiter or salesperson versus focusing on each employee's strengths; each individual will bring different strengths to the table that Piper and its team can benefit from
-Hours and lack and work/life balance; the expectation cannot be that one works late nights or weekends every week, each person will get out what they put in and that should be their choice","-Celebrate more wins and work on finding solutions versus only caring about the numbers that the individual produces; ultimately someone will want to and need to hit their numbers to be happy here, so help to develop and mentor employees so they can be successful - if you invest in your employees they will invest in you

- This is not a 9-5 job.. in order to ""succeed"" in their eyes, you should be in by 7:30am and leave no earlier than 7pm. They WILL complain at you for leaving before 6pm.
- Poor business planning: they decided to hire a ton of new people (recruiters, mainly) in a short span of time, yet were not able to provide the business for them to recruit on.
- False advertising in job security: they made everyone think that they were doing so well, that they were going to open several new offices in the coming year YET laid off 15+ employees in the following 2 months after that. Several of them were ones that were recently promoted or even hired. This goes back to poor business planning.
- Staffing is a production environment but you shouldn't have to yell/nag at your employees twice a day for not reaching sufficient numbers that they liked. A lot of these numbers depend whether someone answers their phone that day or not.. At least have some compassion in that fact.

-Many demotions. They've demoted leaders of the company and threaten others with demotions if you don't keep your numbers up even though you've been loyal to the company for many years.
