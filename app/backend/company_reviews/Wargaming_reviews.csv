2018-03-31,,"Emeryville, CA",Former Employee ,America Woes,America Woes,0,"• Salaried benefits good (401k, plenty of insurance etc.); traditional PTO scheme and not ""unlimited PTO""
    • You'll never stop getting free hoodies.","WG's Emeryville office has closed and American operations will now be based in Chicago and Austin. Some details here may not reflect the current situation, but many aren't isolated to one place anyway.

    • WGA is powerless in a way that could only come from Eastern Europe. For example: products/projects we were alerted about and pushed to produce for much too late, then sometimes would fizzle out months later; the overseas offices talking with American companies (I.e., movie studios) for promotions while WGA remains a lapdog; held back from entire products (Warships Blitz); Europe/Russia-specific fan events with big news that WGA only gets to hear about and maybe report on...and so much more! The office was also frequently at odds with the Chicago development studio, which often pushed to shepherd promoting their own game despite common sense, but now they get to live their fantasy, so kudos.

    • On that note, every interaction with overseas is coated in the old Soviet mentality of meeting quota, period. When other reviews mention poor company culture, this is the real reason why. There is no such thing as slowing down, just an unending routine of putting out patches every month with the same old song and dance. No one will hear that maybe there doesn't *need* to be a patch every month, or that they could get all offices on the same page before springing another new campaign (or entire product) on us. ""Growing pains"" does not explain this away; this is a cultural mountain that will not move until trust and autonomy are established. And Wargaming has been more than big enough, for enough years, to facilitate both of those by now.

    • So much sideways movement it's like a line dance. Managers slide from product to product, most stuck being assistant producers while only external hires get to be seniors; ""coordinators"" become ""specialists"" and the title is the only change. Even interns couldn't find a way back in!

    • Creative initiatives meant to lift everyone up inevitably die in the water, partly because they're from an outdated playbook. There were several attempts at regular livestreams and podcasts, the former always ""launching"" before petering out after a month. Meanwhile WGA rides the coattails of a small number of devoted yet volatile fans that can produce without restraints. To be fair that's not all WGA's fault: the competition keeps growing and the days of World of Tanks getting above the fold on Twitch are long gone.

    • Execs never chime in, which is ironic for Kislyi considering his rambling press interviews. So unless you have an office with a closing door, there's no credible idea how the company is actually doing. You'll only see an email from Kislyi if there's a new exec hired or leaving, and he's visited the office (as in came to say hi to everyone) maybe twice in 4 years. Even if things are steady and there's little to talk about, there's still no talking.

    • The news in December 2017 that WGA's Emeryville office was closing and moving to Chicago was met with few people deciding to transfer. The company's hasty response was to only send admin of the console product to Chicago, and redirect publishing of all other products to the Austin office, but without the Chicago relocation benefits and now having to reapply for your job (probably a cinch, but still a chore). A clear message about how much they really care about their American operations.

Do not look to Wargaming for excitement or growth in the game business. There's so little to do with so little market penetration outside Europe that WGA might as well go back to being an office of four. But WG continues to make money all over, so of course management can continue going through the motions. It's great as a stopgap job for managers from dead studios, or a way for local gamers to earn a few bucks toiling in customer support, but that results in yet another corporate case of everyone else stuck in the middle.",See if Riot's hiring.,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

Why? Well:

- Flexible hours with a strong emphasis on work-life balance - most people work very reasonable hours most of the time, and we purposely schedule in such a way as to avoid crunch. It only ever happens if something's gone really wrong (for example, a bunch of key people all out sick at the same time). But it's never assumed or scheduled. Plus, a lot of positions (not all) have some ability to work from home when someone needs to wait for a delivery or stay home with a sick kid, and our hours are fairly flexible.
- Benefits and Perks - best-of-class maternity and paternity leave, great PTO and holidays calendar, 401K matching, medical/dental/vision/life/etc, all top notch.
- Friendly people, always ready to give advice or just chat
- Casual workplace - it's a game company, of course we're in shorts and t-shirts :)
- Light on bureaucracy - we purposely try to stay very light on paperwork, avoid lots of email spam about stuff nobody cares about, keep things digital (paperless), and try to limit 'meeting hell' compared to anywhere else I've worked.
Successful - the most important, we've been successful for years, have our sights set on an even bigger future for the studio and the company, and we try hard to make sure that success translates into continually improving our employee's experience and growth here at Wargaming.
- Cutting-edge business model - all of our larger projects are free-to-play and free-to-win, which allows for the greatest possible number of players and a great experience for multiplayer (lots of potential opponents and clanmates, lots of chances to make new friends, good matchmaking, etc.).
- Tools to succeed - we have modern facilities, modern equipment, great BI / analytics, and our teams don't lack for anything they need to get the job done.","Our company is a global company, and like most larger companies, that means that decisions sometimes have to go to someone far away. These things take time and are not as simple as a ""water cooler chat"" like in a 1-office studio. On the flip side, some of our folks enjoy getting to travel to new and interesting places :)","Continue to allow our game studios to create their own, local culture, and work the way we want to work.

2017-10-07,,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,Byzantine bureaucratic procedures cripple critical technology,Byzantine bureaucratic procedures cripple critical technology,0,"Wargaming is a booming business, and when it wants to throw money at a problem, it can throw a lot of money.","Every piece of technological infrastructure within the company is horribly mismanaged, by ""owners"" no one knows how to contact, in a configuration that isn't accessible to anyone, on hardware that can disappear at any moment. It's likely that a full day, each week, will be lost to a failure of X, Y, or Z critical backend.

Every technology company has this problem in some severity, but Wargaming actively works against fixing it -- infrastructure ownership is tied directly to internal political power. A middle-manager will often sacrifice the reliability or quality of an important resource, and focus on his own fiefdom's pet project, instead.

International communication problems also hold back internal development. A ""team"" may supposedly span the globe, but in reality only one office is in charge, and the rest are treated like untrusted offshore labor - their suggestions and issues ignored - and get blamed for the ""real"" team's mistakes.

Wargaming's internal technology has problems that no engineer should have to deal with, and the people who can fix those problems refuse to do so.","If you can't get your infrastructure groups to stop fighting with each other, fire them and outsource to IaaS instead. Your technology backbone is holding your developers back.",2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0
2017-09-13, Producer,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,"Excellent, reliable studio","Excellent, reliable studio",0,"As some other reviews have mentioned, there are many things that put Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore apart from other game dev shops. First, the lack of crunch. Sure, when bugs crop up or big features are slipping behind as a code lockdown approaches, there are folks who have to stay late. But the whole, ""we're approaching ship date—we need you guys to come in for 10 hour days and work through the weekend"" thing just doesn't happen here.

Perhaps an even more important positive facet of WGCB is how stable the employment is. The games industry is incredibly volatile (I've been part of multiple full teams laid off due to poor budgeting/planning at other studios), but Wargaming strives to keep people employed. It's very nice to work at a place that doesn't treat people as a disposable means to the end of shipping a game.

One final great thing about working here is the potential for personal career growth and mobility. I've worked my way up through multiple positions at the company, and each step of the way have had a great manager in whom to share my career aspirations. If you're willing to put in the work and make your career goals known to management (and be patient but politely persistent), there's a good chance opportunities will open up for you.","While being a truly global effort, the ""mothership,"" Minsk office and much of the management flowing out of that main development operation are incredibly bureaucratic. There are departments and sub-departments, and enacting any kind of optimization or change to this apparent monolith is nearly impossible. There seems to constantly be an oscillation between ""One team,"" utilizing sometimes suboptimal technical solutions vs. each team around the globe coming up with their own solutions, and this constant struggle can be a bit exhausting.","Chicago-Baltimore: Keep doing your thing, and keep respecting and honoring your employees' aspirations.

- Free snacks, food, alcohol
- Challenging problems to solve (because of constraints/cons listed below)
- new Bellevue office is right next to transit center, super convenient. downtown bellevue is very clean, has a beautiful park and lots of places to have lunch or happy hour at
- Flexible work hours, (10-4 are ""core hours"") and relatively easygoing about work from home policy","There are many teams at Wargaming, so it's highly likely not all cons apply to all teams. This was my experience with the Platform team (called Seattle team, but is located in Bellevue office).

- No one is held accountable. Accountability is washed away in the face of emergency.
- Language/culture barrier... Google Translate only gets so far and not all documentation is professionally translated yet. Indirect vs. direct communication styles are not acknowledged and it leads to unbalanced expectations and a lot of anger against other teams
- Development across two vastly different cultures, multiple programming languages and approaches to tech stacks, 10 hour difference in time zones, and 5+ softwares to communicate through, with little to no defined procedure = nothing works well and everything is unstable
- Systematic attention to symptoms and never the root causes (from both technological and social point of view)
- Middle management tries to re-invent the wheel of communication far, far too often instead of taking feedback from employees at face value... they make new guidelines and policies and proclaim them but never enforce them... strange expectation for everyone to ""self organize"" which leads to mass chaos and no sense of direction
- Technical issues are only prioritized when there's a customer facing problem / break in production; preventative measures / investigations are not prioritized which leaves engineering team burnt out and on edge
- Seattle team has barely any persuasion in the rest of the company. It is a struggle to get appropriate access to machines for troubleshooting or testing.
- Because of resource issues a lot of fixing has to be done directly in production: reproducing issues / test cases is extremely time consuming and management prefers results over quality
- I do more 'digital paperwork' than I do actual technical work. I would say only 10-25% of my technical prowess is utilized at this company.
- Use of agile/scrum is too serious to the point of detriment. Leads to micro management. items sent to backlog are typically forgotten about. If you don't finish something in a sprint it's often assumed to ""no longer be a problem"", then there is again mass confusion when issues resurface
- Managers often have no social skills or no managerial experience -- ""team lead"", ""senior"", and ""manager"" are conflated. Some people don't even want to do administrative type tasks but are forced to. leads to EXTREME resentment and imbalance of power/persuasion.
- Sexism. Woman engineers are frequently talked over, need to defend themselves in unnecessary detail, are excluded from conversations, iced out from decision making, conference calls, business trips and etc. Obviously this is another cultural difference but that does not invalidate the impact on employees. Such a waste of talent. Other reviewers are spot on about this. Yes, these are all very subjective experiences but experiences nonetheless and I doubt it will ever change.
- Little to no morale.
- Rule by fear/shoot the messenger mentality. For example, we were discouraged from talking about bugs or making jokes in Slack because certain ""higher ups"" might see it. engineers not having safe place to vent frustrations kills motivation and passive aggressiveness is off the charts just like in Dilbert comics. Cute at first but gets old quickly.
- Bad work/life balance is rewarded (e.g. 10+ hour work days, working on weekends) and implied that it is necessary at times but never explicitly requested.
- Rampant nepotism, and favoritism... there's a lot of people who I wonder ""what do they do exactly?""
- Gossip, whispering, unclear promotion paths (if any)
- Received a bonus, but ONLY after I complained about management problems, and there was no word of anyone else getting bonuses... leading me to believe they are trying to pacify me with money.

I would suggest to only work here if you are completely out of options.","- Respect your employees by listening to what they have to say. Don't treat them like disposable pawns. Hire managers that actually care about the well-being of the employees instead of using managers just to push narratives from upper management.

- be more transparent (on both an individual and team wide basis) even if that means getting bad news

- hire experienced managers who can set real, individual goals for employees outside of the b.s. corporate performance tracking... and follow up on it. people need direction and feedback desperately.

- stop hiring friends/spouses or people who are not qualified in general. Throwing money and people at issues does not solve problems long term.

- Stop discouraging honesty! Or, if the honesty is too much to handle, DO something about the root issues. engineers need a place to vent about the never ever ending dumpster fires, OR need permission to actually fix things. Quality vs quantity argument applies here. Can't have your cake and eat it too.

Here is a more balanced opinion:

IF he respects you, congratulations, you're in.

IF he starts being a jerk to you, don't hesitate to dust-off your resume and start looking. His middle-managers are talking smack about you, and (weather it's justified or not) you got a target on your back.

Seriously, WHAT IS UP WITH YOU CHICAGO GAME DEVELOPERS?

I have looked at the online portfolios of EVERY lead artist at EVERY Chicago game dev studio…THEIR ART IS HORRIBLE!

So if nothing else the kind of people in the CS department are a delight to be around.,"To begin, this review is strictly for the Customer Service department so I cannot comment on other area's.

Carrier advancement is close to nonexistent. In order for you to advance to another department you need face time with them. This means if you're doing your job you will not have time for it. Sure you can get lucky and get one of the very few good leads and have a shot, but the odds are severely against you.

While there are 2 leads that are good most range from either slackers, incompetent or delusional. They rather count beans than manage the people in the department. I was shocked to find out most had management experience because it doesn't show. Don't think they will take feedback because they don't unless you agree with them.

Training is poor. Don't expect it, be ready to be told ""read the manual"" a lot. That manual is online, disorganized, often out of date and can barely be called a information database much less a training tool.

Scheduling is done via bidding for open spots. Which on the face of it isn't horrible. But consider for a moment that we respond to customers via email with an expected response time of less than 24 hours. We don't communicate through live chat or phone. So whats the point of stressing people to cover an 18 hour window? There isn't but yet we do.","Invest in management training for leads. Not death by PowerPoint, actual training.

It's not necessary to become a manager. I tried to be a team lead, but it was not very exciting for me. My tasks included maintaining the stability of the tank client and managing a team of 6 people. When I finally realized that management is not for me, I talked to my superiors and switched to clients physics.

Freedom of action and promotion of initiative. If the idea is reasonable, it will be brought into the backlog and sent to work. Of course, it depends on the complexity of development, but in general, it's not difficult to bring a reasonable idea to life.
Competitive salary.","If you are not initiative, you will be bored. Interesting tasks go to those who suggested them.
The team has grown very much in the last years. This imposes some restrictions to creativity - you need to negotiate with everyone how and what should work. In a small team, you are making something by yourself, and then you put everyone to the notice. Now you need to explain in advance. On the other hand, this makes one think about viability and many useless ideas fall off by themselves.
Huge code legacy. The ""Tanks"" engine exist for almost 10 years. That means that there's a lot of code written by different people at different times and with different styles. Sometimes it's difficult to understand what and why was written. Any changes require serious analysis and rework. But sometimes it's even fun - to rewrite the code better than it was written before you.","The company passed the way from startup level, rapid growth, ""child disease"" of the corporation to restructuring and optimization of work.

Also, you better get a master's degree on office politics if you want a promotion here. The TV show House of Cards will be a useful introduction for how things work around.

For what I can say, there's no sense of pride nor joy for what most people do. Very sadly, most employees work here as they could work for a potato company, with all due respect for those companies related with potatoes, and would mean exactly the same for them.

Middle Management is staggering self complacent, lazy for the most part and bitter if you dare to bother or force them to deliver results. Also, the lack of competent staff is widely spread amongst all positions within the company.

Those employees that were good or too good for Wargaming, left. From those that have not left, yet, a few of them may be pleasant and competent, although the lack of motivation hinders results.

For sure, there's still a very reduced amount of people that somehow, despite management and how they've been treated in the company, still deliver results. For how long these people will stay around, that remains to be seen.

Nepotism and despotism runs deep and strong, specially around middle management in Community, but they're good at covering themselves. The Underwoods would be proud of you.
