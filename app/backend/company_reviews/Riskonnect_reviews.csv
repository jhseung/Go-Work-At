Riskonnect as a integrated risk management solution is making leaps and bounds. If you enjoy working in Salesforce.com and you like being on the leading edge of technology, this is an exciting place to be.

The new CEO Jim Wetekamp is actively moving the company in the right direction. I'm sad that I won't be there to be part of the forward movement.

I really enjoyed working with the other Account Managers and Technical Consultants, in addition to all the other departments (i.e., accounting, data services, internal operations, sales). As a smaller company, the environment feels very welcoming if you build solid working relationships. Leaving Riskonnect was a difficult decision because I had so many friends and close colleagues.

Other benefits offered are nice too and worth mentioning. For example, flexible work-from-home schedules, lunch ordered from restaurants in the area tax-free instead of a cafeteria, beer tap in cafe, dogs permitted in the office, beautiful walking trail and lake outside the office space which is great for lunchtime walks.","The managers in Client Services and Implementation would benefit from additional training and/or coaching on time management, professionalism and leadership skills. Fortunately, this was actually already in the works when I left, so I have confidence that this will turn around soon. Given that Client services and Implementation leadership is truly the only complaint I have, I wouldn't count Riskonnect out in your job search. Leaders change - there is an ebb and flow to leadership at any company - but the company itself and the product offering is solid.

Started by Great management and industry pioneers (Now gone).

Work from home policy, free soft drinks tea and coffee, beer tap, lunch program, team building trips outside the office. Bonus potential.","Recently acquired by a Third Party Equity Firm (they only look at the numbers and do not care about employee retention or hiring new intelligent employees).

Layoffs now occur almost every two quarters based on company financials. You may get hired but then fired! (although a hiring freeze has started and you may only be placed to work here by a contractor). Layoffs took place just a couple days ago!

Compensation is low relative to other companies in the RMIS and risk software market space. I was at this company for five years and only received 2 to 3 percent merit increases, annually. A promotion never was given to me and (from my view) are very hard to get. However, they will give you a title change. Your tenure here does not mean you will get a more substantial salary increase. This way of treating employees makes you want to leave the company. Which I did. Right now employee turn over is high! I think management does not even care.

The RMIS software market is a small niche market now with more competition today than when this company was started in 2007. Because of this, Riskonnect is exploring other avenues for revenue, like GRC and Healthcare, but is struggling to make headway.

Too much turmoil in the market and at this company means you should avoid working here until the company has had a chance to reorganize fully. Probably in about two years.

CEO just left the company, unexpectedly, in February and no current replacement has been identified.

Medical benefit premiums have recently gone up and are not as good as prior years. Their 401K program has a very low company match rate when compared with other software companies. A low amount of initial PTO time is given when you are hired.

No career path plan was ever given to me or allowed for me to be created by me along with my manager. I felt like my manager did not care about my career advancement opportunities here. Also my manager always seemed to be “too busy.”

All knowledgeable and decent senior leadership either left or were fired when Riskonnect was acquired by the Third Party Equity firm. It is going to take time for new knowledgeable senior leadership to arise (if ever).","Get to learn or create a new company mission statement and philosophy and follow it. Carry it with you and remind everyone to abide by it. Now that you have less employees try to retain them and keep them. Take time out of your busy schedules to meet with your employees about their individual future career path goals within the company. Do not just do whatever the the TPE firm says.

-There's beer in the office (though for how much longer, we don't know).
-Flexible with working from home, hours, etc- great for parents with young kids.
-Dogs allowed in the office (with some rules for doing so)
-use latest technology internally (google suite, Macs, etc.)

These are pretty awesome benefits and the reason I gave two stars instead of one.","Some of the reviews posted earlier this year reflect the recent events adequately...and then some reviews are complete fake- like the one from 10/29? Who would know that benefits are great for both single and family? I personally think they are pretty expensive.

This is a company that used to be great and I thought I'd retire here, but the time is coming to look elsewhere, for several reasons:

1. Severe decrease in transparency, especially in the last 1.5-2 years. Ask 3 different people what's going on, and you'll get three different answers.
2. People: a lot of key, good employees were either let go, ""restructured out"", forced into retirement, or have left as a result of recent management decisions.
3. As a result of number #2, there has been a lot of movement internally and reorganizing. No time given to reach equilibrium.
4. Pay is low compared to competitors.
5. C-Suite seems blind to what the real problems are.
6. Related to #6, company is growing too fast (employees and products) and no consideration given to making operations scalable. No training, under-experienced people put in charge, etc.
7. Internal politics everywhere.
8. Some departments have it easy and barely work 40 hours. Some can barely get their work done in 60-70. This creates a lot of internal strife which management lets continue.

All in, I think things can improve and I don't like to be overly pessimistic. But if you're thinking about working here, maybe check back in a year or two to see if some of this gets fixed.","Open lines of communication.
