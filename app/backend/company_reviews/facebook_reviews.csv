2016-02-16, Site Selection Program Manager,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,Pleasantly Surprised,,0,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership: Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture: The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People: Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management: Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits: Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.","Keep doing what you're doing and fight hard to not be complacent. I believe that humility is the key so don't ever lose that thinking. Your motives will always be suspect, but if you're able to look in the mirror everyday and know that your motives are pure, that's all that matters. Walking the talk is the best evidence there is.",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

- beautiful campus, good snacks, foods, and benefits","If you are a data scientist, you need to really care about two things:

- Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines. It's the fancy machine learning model that will earn you respect.

The company works hard to look after its employees and provide them the best benefits and services. I have yet to see any layoffs. Even when jobs are eliminated Facebook provides assistance to find another position within the company.

- By default, almost everything you ship is used by a lot of people
- Benefits are really good","- You work all the time. It's impossible to truly step away from work. I had dreams about FB projects until about 3 months after I left.
- If you don't end up on a good team, or with a good manager, you're out of luck in terms of ""upwards"" movement and ""impact"". It's really a dice roll unless you're privileged enough to select a specific team.
- Facebook itself is a well greased machine. It self-enforces a lot of its own problems we're seeing the outcomes of today due to how it works. It's unlikely to change that anytime soon, so if you don't like how FB is unable to predict externalities in its work at its scale, you'll be upset working there
- Working at FB is a bit like having blinders on. You're so dang busy and shipping things all the time, it is not conducive for you to think about the big picture and (related to above) the potential butterfly effects/externalities of your work. Many well-intentioned projects end up having disasterous consequences, but I'm confident that 99% of people out there, if they worked on the project, would've also been unable to predict the fallout. The prime example here is Instant Articles, which was a design-lead initiative to give select news partners the ability to make their articles load fast and render ""natively"" in the mobile apps (spun out of Paper after that got shut down). I can assure you that all the team wanted to make was a beautiful interface — it was lead by a product designer — and none of them would've wished to kill ad revenue/contribute to ruining journalism. You can argue that Instant Articles was one in many many steps FB took that ultimately shifted the ability to make money off of news ads from newspapers to FB itself, and lead to today's massive journalism layoffs and click-bait culture (if ya can't get clicks, ya can't get ad views, and ya can't make money). If you ever met the Instant Articles design lead, you'd know all they care about is a good design and polished interactions. But it turns out, just caring about that means you aren't thinking about the potential damage your product can do 4 years down the line.","Facebook's culture will never change. The recent Q4 earnings are a testament to how good the ""ship fast"" machine is printing money. Even a disastrous 3 year long anti-FB PR cycle didn't keep the stock down for long, which means the company won't make major changes to the way they work.

Here are the more radical ideas that will never be implemented:
- Zuck needs to go, or step back into a different role to just focus on his pet projects (which he has many). His low EQ trickles down through the company because all important projects live or die by the ""Zuck Review"", which he offers his gut views on the product. The man is not infallible, and cannot predict bad human behavior because he himself (and those around him) are only human, and have many flaws and oversights due to their background, location, wealth, etc.
- Build more ""local"" product teams. FB to this day insists on running product from HQ, whereas Lays and Doritos know that their American flavors will never work in Southeast Asia and create local flavors with a local team and local testing. Line is a Korean company that has a Thailand specific team to work on Thailand specific features. Facebook has never done this except for a ""project Japan"" to make FB more appealing to Japanese people in the late 2000s/early 2010s.
- Fire a ton of people. There is a lot of incompetence, especially at the management level

Speaking with a number of employees who left Facebook only to return once again, while no company is perfect, there is a lot that Facebook has to offer - not just in terms of benefits, but with the impact that our apps and services have on this world - for people and businesses alike.

Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading. Leadership has been consistently transparent in ways that many other companies are not - even other tech companies - with weekly Q&As, open posts, and quarterly all hands. And they address tough issues or topics head on.

There are a lot of career opportunities within the company - as we often refer to the ""jungle gym"" that you can take your career internally. There are incredibly passionate people who work at Facebook, and I never cease to be amazed by the level of intelligence and care demonstrated by my coworkers around the world to help our company deliver on our mission.","Particularly as of late, Facebook has been subject to a lot of negative press. While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term.

- Internal politics have drastically increased. There is a growing focus on optics vs. impact, which is incompatible with a culture that operates under ""Focus on Impact.""
- I found it difficult to express the company's values such as Be Bold and Be Open in a couple of organizations, because leaders who were external hires brought in a hierarchy, a ""CYA"" culture, and a combination of empire building and swim lanes.
- The culture in some organization is toxic – people feel unsafe voicing their opinions and being their authentic selves.
- Many teams find themselves blinded by metrics, still doing good work but missing the greater opportunities by ignoring clear paradoxes between metrics and customer experience.
- Internal transfer policies can be restrictive due to restrictions around leveling and performance. I know at least three people who left the company who wanted to move to a role that better suited them, but could not because they weren't meeting expectations in their current role (that didn't suit them).","- Spend time getting house in order – Build trust. Identify and remove toxic leaders throughout the organization, Meet with every employee to get pointed, specific feedback on team culture/management. Sure up buggy systems/processes before trying to launch the next feature or bring the next billion people on board.
- Don't attribute current political/data issues as the chief cause for employee attrition. The annual internal survey doesn't quite capture some of the cultural and operational frustrations that employees hold.
- Add more standardization to exit interviews – give them significant weight. This is an opportunity to learn the specific issues that are leading people to leave.

2018-12-22,,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,Mark Luckie Was Right - Facebook doesn’t care about black employees,More than a year,0,"Pay, benefits, and perks. But are they worth selling your soul?","There is a lack of equity for how feedback and ratings are provided to black employees. Impact doesn’t matter, even if peer reviews during PSCs are phenomental; an inexperienced manager can say you did not meet expectations if they choose to rate the Growth areas higher than your Positive Performance.

While there is not official retaliation, managers can have their friends on a team retaliate against your work and impact. Facebook rates tenure over experience, so if you come in with ten years of senior industry experience, but someone has been in a junior role at FB for four years, that junior person’s feedback will be seen as more valuable than the dozens of thanks or recognition you receive cross functionally from other peers.

Black employees at Facebook are constantly treated as being less-than. Posts in Black@ and other groups have shown that White and Asian peers will assume you are janitors and ask you to clean up after their mess, or will cut in front of you, or other ask if you are a guest regardless if your badge is showing. Black people are Othered at Facebook. Your voice does not matter.

Outside of race, Senior people at Facebook are also leaving in droves. In one org specifically, there is lack of equity in pay, managers are under-trained and under-experienced, and there is no support for career growth.

The external media coverage is often dismissed. Facebook regularly says to press “we are sorry, but we will work to do better next time.” Internally, nothing is done, regardless of how many employees raise their voices on an issue.

If I had to sum up Facebook in one phrase, it’s “shut up and do your job.” If I had to sum it up for black employees, it would be “know your place.” And watch your back.","I would offer advice, but you will just ignore it.

We're encouraged to be ourselves, there's no micromanagement, I feel like I'm free to fly as high as I want, they teach us how to have tough conversations, the management team is surprisingly open and forthcoming, the work is fulfilling and important and broadly impactful, the benefits are never-ending (as is the food supply), there's on-site everything– from haircuts to physical therapy to dental care, my coworkers are brilliant and outgoing and very much Type A, work-life balance is incredible compared to the start-up world, and that's just scratching the surface.

If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
  As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering. Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering. You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does. Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles. Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense: gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around. there's basically an offsite every other week. Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing. The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers. no, seriously. say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away. you are kicked off the team and put on another team. what sense does that make? new mom wants to wfh? not allowed.
 Seriously, it's called skype, people.

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack. instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project. a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project. This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken. I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly. bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix. seriously? why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance. no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom. What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE. Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why. But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.","separate managers from IC. some of the best people I have ever worked for were not programmers.

stop focusing on impact, it sounds like a colon and its utterly meaningless

if it's broken, fix it. if your metrics change as a result, deal with it.

At Facebook, you have the opportunity to work on products that everyone uses. This helps you use and sharpen your skills in an entirely new way, and really think through your logic and decisions—unpacking every detail because you have to make sure it works and is understood across all demographics, countries, cultures, and languages.

They also take care of employees. Everything is free: shuttle rides, laundry service, professional development courses, tons of swag, and all the food, snacks, and drinks you can eat (the “Facebook 15” is real). The company’s health benefits are unmatched and they even have medical, dental, and gym facilities on campus.","- politics and back channeling
- competitiveness and lack of collaboration
- relationships hold more value than quality work

Facebook the company is like the platform: everyone acts like everything is great, but no one acknowledges or exposes what’s really going on under the surface. People act like it’s all sunshine and roses, but because there’s such a “focus on impact” and performance, it’s actually a competitive environment where people are out for themselves and scrambling for whatever projects will give them the most visibility—at Facebook, visibility > impact > high performance ratings > bonus multipliers + equity refreshers.

As a result, people you know and being an influencer matter more than the quality of your work. Likes are the real currency and even though you’re told to “be your authentic self”, one type of person benefits most: those who are extroverted, don’t rock the boat, and are oftentimes male.

While the actual benefits and perks are great, don’t be fooled by the glamour of it all: they’re also designed to keep you there and keep you working. You’ll be taken care of, but the focus on impact and performance makes it’s easy to forget to take care of yourself. There’s an undercurrent of anxiety in the culture that is very real and not often acknowledged.

Facebook is a great company for those just starting out their career. If you’re a seasoned professional, I suggest staying away. It doesn’t matter how much experience or expertise you have—I spent most of my time proving to people half my age that I knew what I was doing.

Time and again, my suggestions would be ignored or edited to the point that they were no longer my ideas. Time and again, leadership would be shown those watered down ideas and say, “Nope!” Time and again, when I’d go back to my original recommendation, leadership would say, “That’s the one!” After awhile, it was finally time for me to say, “I’m tired of (and better than) this.”","You hire people for their expertise, so let the use it.

Community is at the core of FB. I’ve never worked at a company that cares so much about its people. Taking care of yourself and working sustainably is part of the culture. All the amenities are there to keep you focused (or distracted). Food, snacks, multiple gyms (with classes), car service, life@ (I took my passport photos there for heavens sake).

We have, workplace, FB’s own internal app. It’s like Facebook within Facebook for employees. I can message anybody and be in contact with anybody in the company. I’m an entry level engineer and talk to VPs Directors and even Mark, who holds open forum EVERY Friday in person. That level of access is phenomenal.

If you have an idea you can do it. You have the support and finances to achieve whatever you can think of. If you’ve worked anywhere else then you can see why everything I’ve written is so important. It just isn’t like that anywhere else.","It’s so good that it would be hard to work anywhere else. I’m destroyed for life. If it’s your first job I would feel bad because this is NOT a true view of the working world. If you’re humble enough to appreciate that then you should be ok. I believe people can develop a degree of entitlement and hubris in this environment. You can run into folks like that, but the majority of others are great.","Mark is doing a fantastic job managing a service that over 2 Billion people use worldwide.

- You are being recognized for impact, not for how many years of experience you bring to the table. This helps getting good reviews for hard work, even when you're young and unexperienced.
- You get many opportunities to work cross-functionally, which is great for diversity of thought. Personally, I like the fact I am exposed to working with technical and non-technical people.
- Some of the benefits are amazing. Fertility treatment coverage and in general medical coverage are the best out there.","- Facebook purposefully hires very smart and ambitious individuals. Even when there's no pressure from the manager to work long hours, you often see people working long hours, which in return puts more pressure on you.
- There are no incentives to stay in the company for longer than 4 years. Once you vest all your RSUs, refreshers you get for good performance look very unattractive. It's more and more common for people to leave FB after 4 years, and come back a year later to re-negotiate their RSUs.

2018-05-22, Software Engineer,"Cambridge, MA",Current Employee ,Evil company run like a criminal gang,More than a year,0,Salary (to offset the rest),"What took me two years to understand is that this company is run like a criminal gang. They do not value technical expertise as much as loyalty and subordination. This is a brutal world (remember: criminal gang!) where people are punished frequently for unrelated reason and for no reason whatsoever, and always kept under pressure, sense of fear and uncertainty.

The most disgusting thing is lies. Management lies through their teeth, about everything! They create alternate reality, to justify everything they do.

They do stack ranking: 15-18% is targeted not to meet their expectations) - they lie that they do not do that. Compared to Amazon which targets 5%, this is horrible.

At lower levels (IC3-IC4) they have up-or-out: either you get promoted or you get fired. IC5 level is considered (which is a lie) to be ""very very senior leadership"". When you look at the distribution, more than a half of engineers are IC5+. Given the fact that IC4s are expected to perform consistently at IC5 level in order to be promoted (so they are effectively IC5's), we get a whopping 85% employees being ""senior leadership"" - it's disgustingly evil. It results in the most toxic work environment I have ever experienced in my career.

Facebook operates in a ""burn-out mode"": they hire fresh meat, squeeze every drop of juice out of them by overworking, then fire them when they are exhausted. Their model of employment is not sustainable by definition (and is implemented via stack ranking, as well as other tools).

Employees are held at a constant state of stress. I've seen employees crying in the office, in front of management.

Management mastered an art of vague flip-flopping: no consistency, no responsibility whatsoever.

Top management supports this authoritarian criminal pyramid: nobody got fired as a result of recent scandals of data leaks, top VPs were only moved around. Scandal was covered with lies.

The hyped-up parental leave is only a PR stunt and a lie: for taking it one gets performance review downgraded.

Endless semi-mandatory hackathons to further drain your energy. Oh, there is also a measure of counting ""thanks"" you got during last half a year. If you don't get enough thanks, that's an excuse to downgrade your performance. I say ""excuse"", because there is a huge leeway for a manager to justify any rating at PSC. All performance manager's feedback is vague and non-actionable.

Very few people take vacations, due to peer pressure and fear.

Everybody whom I talked to were stressed and unsure if they would be employed in 6 months.

I wonder where they manage to hire such a low-integrity people. Especially HR: they are the kind of people who just wait for their despot to come to power when they gladly start sending people to Gulags. There is nothing humane about these atrocious individuals.

Facebook lies about supporting freedom of speech. In fact, internally you can get easily fired over saying something quite benign. People complain a LOT to management and HR - for minute reasons. A lot of tell-tales for which they occasionally fire without explanations.

Finally, Facebook's business practices are quite questionable at best.

Among ICs they foster the culture of subordination, impostor syndrome. I guess this makes sense, because this is the only way to cope with Dunning Krueger management.",You should go to prison. All of you. You've done enough damage to this country and the world.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

2018-03-30,,"Menlo Park, CA",Former Employee ,Simultaneously the best and worst experience,More than a year,0,"The positive impact that the company is having all over the world is outstanding even if the company doesn't share this externally. There are many professional development opportunities to allow you keep growing. The perks could be a pro like free food, laundry, salon, etc. but I personally found it to feel like the company wants to keep you there instead of going home and having social interactions with people outside of Facebook. But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations. They also keep bad managers in their positions, even if there have been multiple concerns raised about them from a whole team. The values the company promotes are great in theory, but I don't see them in practice.","Promote middle managers internally - the more you bring external hires in, the more the company culture erodes, as these external people are stuck in their ways and not willing to do things the Facebook way, and the way ICs are told to expect things in bootcamp creating a total misalignment between expectations and reality. Also, when you know someone is a bad manager, remove them for the situation instead of allowing them to continue to lead their team astray or throw their ICs under the bus. After all, managers have the ability to have more positive or negative impact than an IC, but they have multiple safety nets built around them to protect them whereas ICs are on their own. Lastly when employees indicate they're interested in moving teams don't ask them to weather the storm for another 6 months in hopes that the next manager will make things calmer - listen to what they are experiencing that's making them want to switch teams and have a more appropriate work/life balance and a better experience with their manager.",3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0

2014-03-17, Software Development Engineer,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,"Open, fast, no bs",More than a year,0,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc.

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",You need to focus on how you are going to maintain the existing culture and protocols as you grow.

The role of a sourcer and recruiter is becoming smaller and smaller. And although leadership insists they care, every action they take suggests they do not. It is hard to constantly be reminded that you are merely just another number to be replaced asap.

Be prepared to work long, long hours. There isn't such a thing as ""work/life"" balance as most in recruiting will work into the night and weekends.

* Really awesome internal tools
* Unbelievable compensation & perks
* The company trusts & believes in its employees
* You become associated with the Facebook brand
* Also a con, but you have a ton of freedom in what you work on","The tl;dr is Facebook is a big company and its cons reflect that. The company mission and values are incredibly admirable, but have become increasingly difficult to implement as the company has grown.

* You might find yourself working on a project with over a million lines of code, but nobody on your team has written more than 10,000. The need to sit down and figure it out yourself can be pretty stressful in an environment that is pushing you to ""make an impact"" and be constantly shipping new features.
* The few senior engineers (in my org at least) show little interest in mentoring more junior engineers.
* Sink or swim mentality among engineers, the mega-teams supporting products in the core app can be brutal and unwelcoming.
* Launch decisions are very political - criteria for launching a change is opaque, and feedback from department leads happens far too late in the development process (often in the meeting where a launch decision is being made!). Little has been done to fix these issues despite it being constant feedback for the past year.
* Performance reviews put too much emphasis on immediate personal output rather than collaboration and assisting other teams. This causes teams and individuals to focus inwardly. While it's never been malicious, I've seen this behavior directly harm other team's productivity or metrics.
* Work/life balance is below average on the day-to-day, but oncalls are truly awful.
* Decision-making has become a bit too distributed between orgs and reflects in the overall product.","* Pay close attention to teams that have poor retention and take drastic measures to reverse the vicious cycle (the less seniority on a team, the faster the turnover rate becomes)
* I think there is a gap between what's best for the company and what is rewarded in performance reviews. Fixing performance reviews (starting with incentivizing mentorship & collaborative behavior) will likely fix many of the current problems at Facebook.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0

I don't regret joining FB:

- I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what.

- Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds.

- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.

- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude.

I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay.

Part of this is that the starting comp isn't very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago.","Most brutally, to many of the leaders in Ads and elsewhere: Your job is to set strategy and standards, ask aggressive and important questions in reviews, debug high-level problems before they hit the front page of the NYTimes, and find the right resources for your teams. It's not to write leadership manifestos about how to feel inspired. People will upvote soft memos when they're posted, and there's a growing culture that feels they have to to be on your good side. Fight that temptation and show that intellectual rigor and shipping impact, not pandering, still holds the day.

In so far as your job is to lead culture, it's also to build a culture that values people for their experiences *before* Facebook. In a company growing this fast and hiring at the middle, not just the bottom, we will have to agree that outside experience matters, or new employees will waste months if not years earning their stripes to prove their code and analysis and strategy and diffs are credible, too. And while there is onboarding time for everyone, this period is navigated alone here much more than it is in hierarchical organizations with mentors/mentees, year cohorts, other structures to force learning, and this lack will be more and more unsustainable as hiring accelerates over the next years.",3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0

I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important.

And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity. So if you value separating your personal life and work life, don't want to share your personal feelings with coworkers or hear about theirs (or offer emotional support), or don't like to share with other people in the broader company what you're working on, it may be a bad fit for you. Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you. Finally, Facebook's primary Menlo Park campus is located in the middle of nowhere with very little else around - you eat and get all your services on campus, with the nearest downtown a 15 min drive away.

2017-12-05, Software Engineer,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,Best Large Tech Company Culture,Less than a year,0,"From the start, Facebook has been amazing.

Bootcamp was a great experience; not too many companies let a new grad spend 6-8 weeks searching for a good team fit. They let you pick a team, which essentially means you get to pick your tech stack (Backend; Front-end; Mobile; Infrastructure), the org you work for (Messenger, Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, etc.). More importantly, you get to pick your manager + team mates, where as in other large companies, it's the other way around; you are assigned to a product & org & manager whether you like it or not. This is way different compared to Google's opaque 'host matching' process and Microsoft where they just randomly place you in a division like Azure or Office.

The company values really shine through every day. Before Facebook I thought the concept of company values was kind of corny and B.S. Now that I'm at FB I can at least say that here the company values are actually values held by top management + majority of the workforce and not just marketing / HR speak.

Everyday I really feel like we are moving fast and shipping a lot of product very quickly. We A/B test lots of features, analyze the data, and swiftly decide what to ship to the public. I never feel stuck; I always feel like I'm either implementing an A/B test or analyzing data so we can ship more features. There are not long product cycles with lots of prognostication from product leadership; we build, measure, then learn. Thats it.

I feel everyday that we have an open culture. At Facebook, we use Workplace, a tool thats kind of like Facebook but for corporations, made by you guessed it... Facebook. Within Workplace, just like normal FB, there are a ton of groups. I'm in a bunch of groups and basically get visibility on decision making + product updates + news from every part of our org. I feel like I'm in the loop and just learn so much about FB / product by reading my Workplace newsfeed. For example, today I read a research report about internet users in India, learned some stuff about dynamic ads, and saw one of the senior leaders announce a new partnership deal. All of that info isn't directly relevant to my day-to-day job, but because its all there and open to anyone, I learn so much and have so much clarity into FB's product vision & company objectives. Mark or Shreyl do Q & A's every Friday. Between hearing top leadership speak, and reading updates from every part of the company on Workplace, I feel that FB is a very open and transparent place to work.

There are many other pros and cultural values that I like but let me get to a major pro to end this review. Food!
Here's just a sample from today! I ate these 3 meals today at the company cafe 2 mins walk away from my desk.

Breakfast:
Soft Boiled Egg + Been + Cheese + Salsa Tostada. Organic Blueberries & Blackberries. Hemp & Pumpkin seeds.

Lunch:
Vegetarian Pho with Sous Vide Eggs, Tofu, Steamed Cabbage, Green Onions, Cilantro, & Bean Sprouts in it. Added Sriracha and Chili Oil to spicen it up.
Thai Iced Tea Bobba (Bubble) Tea.

Dinner (today was Jamaican themed):
Sweet Potato & Corn Casserole, Collared Greens, Fried Plantains, & Quinoa.
I also got a slice of cheese pizza :)

Dessert: Mango Cheesecake made with Graham Cracker Crust.

By the way, the menu rotates, and at the HQ, there are a ton of cafes to choose from so way more options for food are there.","Work life balance is tough. Can have some busy weeks due to the ""move fast"" culture. Plus you have a lot of ownership which brings with it some stress.

1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.

2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.

3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be.

Company culture is so, so good. I've had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career.

It also feels like senior and C-level management really cares about employees. It feels like Facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person (but be sure to ask for what you need! nobody's a mind reader).

For eng, bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea. I freaking love my team, and I get to own my decision to join that team (rather than some hiring/allocation manager deciding where I get to go).

Very few operational rules/bureaucracy. I can ssh into any machine I need to. If someone's fighting a fire anywhere in the company and I am able to help, I feel like I can always jump in to help. I really like Infra, so being at a big company like FB is super fun.","Oncalls can kill your sleep during your oncall shift if things are noisy overnight

2017-10-15, Product Specialist,"Menlo Park, CA",Current Employee ,"Believe the hype, this is by far the best place I've ever worked",Less than a year,0,"Not even sure where to start. It goes without saying that this company takes GREAT care of its employees, and then some. The work is challenging and super intense, but the positive and collaborative cultre, along with all of the perks/benefits offered, make the intensity much easier to deal with as opposed to any other company I've worked for.

I've been at FB for a bit over four months, but I knew during my interviews (btw these were the hardest interviews I've ever had) that this was the place to be. From application to job offer, it took 6 weeks. When I got the offer, it was so strong that there as no need to negotiate. When I got the job and relocated from NY to CA, the relocation package was was so good I didn't have to raise a finger or spend a dime. Already knew at that point that this company knows how to retain talent.

This place truly rewards merit, courage, and being outspoken. Management is aware enough (at least in my space) to place me in a role that plays to my strengths, and I've enjoyed th freedom to make my role what I want to be. They are very outspoken when you're performing well and are honest about things that need improvement. If you have a good idea that is supported by data and aligns well with the goals of your team or whatever your target population may be, you will find resources or people to join you in your efforts. From hackathons to day-to-day work, this culture permeates every area of the company.

One thing that strikes me the most is how strong the diverse community (however small) is within this company. There are a lot of resources put towards ERG/FBRG efforts, and as a diverse employee, this means A LOT to me.

I know the norm is to move around the industry every five years or so, but I don't see myself leaving this company for a long time. In just four months, I feel deeply rooted here, and I intend be here for a while. If you're reading this, there should be no question about applying, interviewing, or accepting an offer. You'll be happy that you made the decision.","This may be limited to my team or my area of the company, but I believe there is an underlying ""me, me, me"" culture at FB. There is a constant need to make your work visible so that others know what you're doing and so that whoever has a similar idea doesn't take the shine before you do.

Separately, everyone wants to do knock-out work, and at times are secretive about the things that they're working on so that they can have that ""holy crap"" moment when they finally finish and reveal the results of their work. This can result in wasted resources and time since multiple people/small groups coule be working on the same thing without knowing it. Not sure what the solution is, but this at times takes away from collaborative work. I identify it as a con, but I've quickly found myself doing the same thing, and that's just because it's an underlying, unspoken culture at the company.",More work needs to be done re: PSCs.

Inexperienced recruiters or bad ones can attribute to poor candidate experience and headaches for other recruiters.

To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies.

Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.

Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.

It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.

It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies.

It's so precious being able to find a place where you can just focus on your work.",It's a long commute for San Franciscans who come down to Menlo Park because we don't have an SF office yet.,"I wish we were less humble and more braggy about the culture here.

2017-05-08, Business Operations,"Menlo Park, CA",Former Employee ,Great Place to Work but,More than 3 years,0,"- At it's best working at Facebook is fast paced, fun and extremely impactful. I've been given opportunities to work with many great colleagues who care deeply about the work that you're doing and will challenge and encourage you to do better.
- Support staff at Facebook is amazing whether it be the people who greet you in the morning, facilities, IT, the security guards, chefs, or the the people who work at the gym. Everyone is super friendly and has your best interest at heart. It's like going to work at a 5 Star Hotel every single day :)
- Feedback is taken very seriously and typically acted upon. For example a couple of years ago Facebook didn't offer 4 months paternity leave for employees outside of the US and after receiving feedback from international employees this was policy was expanded globally
- Perks are amazing, free food, gym (or membership for offices without gyms), laundry, great healthcare.","- Mid-level managers are a hit or miss. I've had 4 different managers in 3 years at Facebook and my experience at work has greatly been dependent on how competent they are. My best manager pushed me and opened doors and was a true advocate for me within the company, whereas my worst manager who was also a first time manager made me feel as if I was working on an island. If you're joining Facebook in a non-tech role you should definitely try your best to get a feel for your future manager.
- As the company has hired over 10K+ people over the past 3 years roles and responsibilities are definitely becoming more specialized and opportunities to drive tangible impact are becoming increasingly difficult for people in junior roles
- Pay and benefits for people working in international offices are not comparable to working at HQ. For example IVF is offered in the US but not non-US offices.","As Facebook grows and continues to invest in hiring, finding people with prior management experience will be key to retaining and developing talent.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

Upon arriving to the office every morning, everyone from the reception staff to your team says hello to you, and genuinely is interested in your life. People love coming to work every morning and are excited about what they do here every day, and it shows.

Many companies as competitive as this expect a lot from their employees, and so does Facebook. However, they also encourage a healthy work/ life balance, ensuring their employees are taking enough time off (either by working reasonable hours every day, and/or actually using all of their PTO) to be able to stay fresh and ready to work when at work.","Not many cons to the company.

I've had this dissonance in past roles: ever since academia years ago, I've been out of the ""research"" phase and into the ""engineer at a X company"" stage, where ""X"" is occasionally a software product but more often a service or commercial product. The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now. Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.

Facebook has my people, my culture. We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense. Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.

I'm in the culture fit. Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.

I'm in my mid-40s. I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s. ...and it's awesome.","Pace is a killer. The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work.

Whatever you heard or read about Facebook really doesn't give the place enough credit. I'm not in HR/recruiting or even management, but I do see a common trend in everyone they bring on board. Everyone is smart, motivated, non-judgemental, and freakishly CARING. There are so many people with heart at FB.

To be honest, you can be one heck of a coder, but if you're selfish - I don't think you will get hired here. I've previously worked at Google and MSFT; FB blows both of them out of the water (maybe I'm a little biased). Other pro's of course are...

+ Free world class food options all day long on the main campus cafeteria (MPK 20/21).This includes great snacks/drink options everywhere else as well.

Any company can pay lip service to things like collaboration, fun, caring about people, wanting you to feel comfortable at work, building community, etc. But having an open and honest environment at our size is one of the hardest things to do, and yet Facebook seems to do it so effortlessly. I love coming into work every day because I know I'll be challenged in the right ways, I'll embrace hard conversations because I know we're all working to the shared mission, and I know that everyone leaves their ego at the door without other agendas. It's truly magical and like nowhere else in the world.

Also, you get used to it after a while, but the perks are out of this world. I never worry about much of anything in my personal life because Facebook takes such good care of us.","Facebook's size means your scope of work may not be as broad as it was at a 5-person startup. However, most days I see that as a positive because we get to masterfully execute our day-to-day and we're growing a lot.","As you're already doing, keep prioritizing the culture first and foremost when we add so many new people.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2017-02-05, Software Engineer,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Software Engineer,More than a year,0,"1) The only metric we're measured on is ""impact"". This feels completely fair to me. It also means you get to pick your own hours as long as you get some impactful things done and you're still in sync with all of the other people on your project.
2) It's easy for engineers to switch teams. That means you don't need to know what you enjoy working on before you join and you can't get stuck with a bad manager.
3) New York-specific: the company is in East Village, which means you can live in the most exciting part of the city AND have the luxury of walking to work.
4) I think Facebook's company history is interesting.
5) Facebook's language infrastructure is phenomenal. Its PHP and Javascript is type-checked, which makes it so much easier to read without typeof checks everywhere.","1) New York-specific: There's about 15 different engineering teams to choose from, which can be a deal breaker if your heart is already set on a particular team we don't have.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
