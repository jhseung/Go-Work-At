2015-10-22,,,Former Employee ,Customer Service Representative,Customer Service Representative,0,The work itself is extremely easy and it's steady employment. Sometimes you can read a book or literally sleep on the job as long as you're on your managers good side. If you can fake a smile everyday and act like the most happy go lucky person ever than you are good here. The paid time off is pretty cool too.,"It doesn't matter how well you do. They care more about a friendly office environment than they do productivity so your entire job depends on kissing up to management and being friendly. The pay is terrible as well as either a processor or phone rep. There is absolutely no chance of advancement. There are unnecessary rules like dress codes, no cell phones allowed and don't go on outside websites for no reason at all. There is a noticeable division between the front office and the hourly call center positions. You will frequently be told to do something, be told it's wrong, and then management will deny it moments later. This company has no loyalty.","Management doesn't care, they just play politics like office water cooler chat.",2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
