The size of the company is also ideal- everyone makes an impact and has the opportunity to be recognized. The company sponsors visas and projects do not require security clearances.

-I get to work on a variety of projects, which always keeps things interesting. It also allows for a continuous learning experience. I'm never bored and I truly love coming into work everyday.

-Although there have been some rough waters, as is always the case when a company goes through an acquisition, I feel the upper management is working on getting back to a sense of stability. The exec team is always available to talk, listen to feedback, and answer questions.

-Only a block from the metro in Clarendon, with lots of options for bars/restaurants. Office has a beautiful view of the National Mall and access to the rooftop.

-Casual atmosphere. Can't get much better than getting to wear t-shirts and jeans to work. People are always playing on the foosball and ping pong tables.

I've never worked at a company with employees who are so exceptionally talented, collaborative and passionate about the work we do than my colleagues here at Symplicity. Many employees on the product and client services side are actual industry-experts who came from higher ed, as well as most of the new VP team coming from many years of experience in higher ed tech--this has made it quite easy to build credibility and reputation in our markets.

- Growing company. Because of the state of the company (solid financials and a strong growth strategy), there are opportunities to grow with the company and build your career over time if you put in the hard work and dedication.

- Market opportunity and outlook. It's rare for a company to have multiple market-leading solutions in one product suite.

- Solid work-life balance . Work hard, play hard.

- Meaningful work. While our flagship product remains the market leader in the career services space, our full product suite in higher education serves other core areas of student services like disability services and accommodations and student conduct management.

- New HQ. The company HQ moved from Rosslyn to the heart of Clarendon last year. The new HQ is right off Clarendon metro and has amazing views of D.C., a rooftop, 24-7 gym and other perks!","- Many of the employees prior to acquisition were remote staff in client services--and while this can definitely be an advantage for providing in-region support for our thousands of clients all over the world, this makes it tough to engage the many employees who are remote as you would those at HQ.

From my first day, people have been really welcoming and eager to help. It's a relatively small company (200 or so employees) with many young employees and it still has a bit of a start-up feel so it's very more laid-back. If you are in the Arlington office, we tend to play music all day on the speakers, get free snacks, play ping pong, and do social activities on Fridays. The company is also very big on diversity as we've been expanding our business internationally and work with folks from all types of backgrounds - probably my favorite part about working here. There aren't that many layers of management and you get exposure to C-suite execs from day one. On my first day, the CEO proactively came over to my desk to introduce himself.

- Casual work environment
- Benefits are decent","I have seen tons of people come and go during my tenure here. I also have been through 3 different CEOs. Most of these recent positive reviews are from people who haven't been around the block here.

- Erosion of benefits since the sale of the company back in July 2016. Company-wide ""raises"" of 2.5% (more like COL adjustments hailed as raises). About 6 people got promotions but didn't get a real ""raise"" to reflect said promotion. The ""revocation"" of work-from-home option for people in the DC (HQ) area; people had to ""re-apply"" to work from home.
- No paid training (or even reimbursement upon successful completion of training paid out-of-pocket), despite management saying it will happen eventually (this has been a continual problem across 3 separate leadership administrations).
- Layoff of approximately 13% of the company to be outsourced overseas.
- New CEO (Matt Small) more-or-less forced out old management and replaced with his former colleagues from another company.
- New management is obsessed with the bottom line, and as a result, the staff suffer.
- Tons of turnover, both voluntary and involuntary (despite HR reassuring that the turnover rate is actually pretty good for the tech industry).
- Below-average wages (although I'm sure the VP/C-suite are making average/above average).
- Many departments are terribly understaffed (and have been for a while).","- Listen to the lower-level staff; they have their ear to the ground and know the inner workings of this company better than you.
- Treat staff like people and not cattle.
- Don't lie to staff. Don't say the company is financially fine. Don't say wages are competitive. The evidence says otherwise (no real raises, outsourcing, etc).

2017-02-18,,"Arlington, VA",Former Employee ,Finally growing up with a first time CEO and experienced management,Finally growing up with a first time CEO and experienced management,0,"* Passionate, dedicated front line employees from before the acquisition. Many of them are industry experts and are wonderful to work with. They made my time at Symp a real pleasure.

* The company used to be split 50/50 in-office and remote. It appears most of the new hires are going to be in the DC-area, highlighting CEO's desire to have people close by. This builds more of a community. If you are seeking remote work flexibility and live in the DC area, this is no longer the place for you.

* New VP's are incredibly experienced and skilled. Most have a background in building BlackBoard from scratch in the 2000's and have other experience to add, as well.

* Solid financials. Very little/no debt and profitable each year. Funded by a massive private equity investor, who removed the old owner and installed the new leadership team.

* Some okay benefits, like 2% 401(k) match, along with FSA (medical and child care).

* Investments being made in internal processes and sales/support systems. Removing the old home-grown CRM and bringing in a real ERP will be tremendous. This was underway when I left.

* Strategy proposed by the leadership team makes great sense. Consolidate product offerings, increase prices to fall in line with the true value of the solutions, and build a great sales team. The international flavor to increase reach using resellers is also ideal to drive major growth.

* Solid work/life. Good time off from day 1 and unlimited sick time. There are also some sponsored events like the company 5k, day of service, etc. They used to have a super flexible remote work policy which was pretty widely abused before the CEO changed it. If you are in DC, you are expected in the office, which I think is an okay way to go. The rollout was botched, but the rationale is good. Be together as often as possible. I'm okay with that.

* New office in Clarendon coming in Spring of 2017.","* Great strategy cannot overcome mediocre tech. The core architecture is 10-15 years old and is held together by virtual duct tape. Things like responsive design, UX updates, data imports, and even calendaring are severely limited by the core platform. The current tech stack is not the most stable and is subject to short crashes that cause users to lose tons of work. The ""reporting"" solution cannot do multiple if/then functions and looks old. It is barely considered reporting. The best way to go is to update the data model and rewrite the products from the ground up. I doubt this will ever happen because it requires a major investment to time and effort with no 2017 revenues. Prediction: they will keep patching until the system collapses. This is short term thinking that will cost way more long term.

* Average products. While the recurring revenues are good, the products were state of the art in 2005, which means old. They are also far too flexible and have too many customization options. There is no standard offering or easy way for customers to deploy and be self-sufficient. The result: thousands of non-technical customers getting what they say they want instead of what they need. This creates an overreliance on Support and a lack of trust in the products to solve the problem. This is unsustainable for profitable growth and leads to customer churn and low satisfaction.

* Staff turnover. Between November 2016 and January 2017, 20 people left the company. Half are layoffs, half are resignations. They also just completed a major layoff of another 25-30 folks. While no one is irreplaceable, the transition and training costs will be high until things stabilize. I think it will smooth out, but things are tumultuous now (February 2017).

* Leadership interpersonal skills. Certain C-level staff interactions with non-management staff is awkward at best and terrible at worst. I found these folks to be willfully tone deaf and unengaged with anyone who wasn't a VP or investor. A perfect example: Walking by my desk 8-10x a day for 3 months and looking through me like I didn't exist almost every time. There is no cost to making eye contact or saying ""hi"" once in a while.

* Fake transparency. This is a top-down organization run by capable, intelligent, driven, successful executives. If you are not an investor or a VP, you do not have a seat at the table anymore. Monthly all hands are sold as a time for staff to ask questions. That is rarely true. These meetings are a time for management to openly communicate to the staff how things are going and what is needed from them. During my time, even moderately difficult staff questions were either ignored or dodged, and the meetings were cut short when leadership got tired of taking questions. I felt like staff inquiries were never a priority or taken seriously.

* There is currently no General Counsel. The highly experienced GC was laid off (reason unknown) in January 2017, and his duties are being split by other executives who are trained attorneys. A $40mm company with 200-250 people without an independent GC screams unnecessary risk to me. Note: This may have been resolved, but it is true as of February 2017.

* Ethics part 2. Around Thanksgiving, there was an incident with former HR leadership running meetings to lay off staff, then transitioning themselves from HR into the now-vacant roles. It is inappropriate to allow HR staff to interview for roles they know are coming open and cruel to allow them to run the termination meetings on behalf of the company. This is a potential conflict of interest that reinforces the need for a true General Counsel.

* Pay/bonuses. Many ""old Symp"" employees are underpaid for the market. If you are coming aboard, be assertive and make your salary expectations clear with evidence from GlassDoor and similar sites. Do not accept less than you think you are worth. If you are promised something like a raise or bonus, get it in writing with crystal clear dates, criteria for qualification, along with penalties for Symp if they don't follow through. I know of employees who had severely delayed bonus payments or payments not made at all in 2016 because their contracts were vague. Get a lawyer to review your offer letter. Don't trust them to meet any verbal or implied obligations.

* Sub-par benefits. Benefits don't kick in until the 1st of the month after you start. They don't tell you this up front, so it can be a jarring way to begin work. The healthcare options are expensive and terrible quality. Paychex, the HR provider, has great customer service after they mess something up (and they will). The 401(k) mutual funds are average offerings and come with high fees. Finally, there are almost no supplemental life ($10,000 cap) and no disability benefits. If you have a spouse or partner to provide better and cheaper options, this will probably be your best bet.","I left because new top leadership created an environment where I felt my time and work was neither important nor valued. This uncertainty led me to look for and find what has become a wonderful next opportunity. So, thank you for pushing me to find this next step at the right time.

Other comments:

* If you expect people to be in the office every day, you should supplement or cover their parking or offer a flat $2,500 raise to in-office staff, especially folks who were promised flexible work-from-home options when they were hired. Change in policy should not come at such a heavy cost to the employee alone.

* It is okay for top leaders to say ""thank you"", ""I'm sorry"", and ""I was wrong... and I'm going to fix it."" Those are phrases I did not hear after the executive transition. As employees, we don't want parties or ping pong tables as much as we want appreciation when we do a good job. That costs you nothing.

* Build a true V2 of your products and prepare to transition away from the SympleObjects/Manager core as soon as possible. Your current strategy is akin to building a sky scraper atop a nuclear waste site. Build a new foundation.

* Invest in all Symp employees with a robust training budget. This was a limitation under old ownership, and it should not be under new leadership. You have a profitable company. Invest some of the profits in getting better as a community.

* Pay your stars. Now that you have laid off folks who don't fit your vision, invest in your real rock stars at Symp. Pay them at 75-99th percentile for their title. You will get a return on your investment.

* Upgrade staff CPU's. There are people getting by with 5-7 year old laptops that weigh 10 lbs. Get a new contract or provider and give your people the tools they need to kick butt.",3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

2014-02-25, Client Support,"Remote, OR",Former Employee ,Disorganized / Chaotic Company,Disorganized / Chaotic Company,0,"*Remote working. This is the best part about the company, and a great perk.

*Pretty good products. The products could be better, and there are too many. More focus on core higher ed producs and better design would greatly improve client satisfaction. Overall , the software has some great things that provides a good service to higher ed.

*Nice people. The staff is pretty cool and for the most part easy to work with.","*Chaotic management and company organization. If you like being pulled into multiple projects with no clear direction, terrible task management applications, and too many people involved, this is the place for you. The systems, including the phone system, and the in-house databases are bad. The products can be clunky, slow, and hard to use.

*Mediocre pay. The pay is ok, but not great. Most people I knew there feel the pay was too low. I agree, but it wasn't that bad. Good if you are just starting out or have a spouse / partner that makes pretty good money. Considering the Corporate HQ is in Arlington, VA, the in-office staff must feel underpaid.

*Mediocre benefits. Vacation and Work-Life balance are seriously lacking. The job can be never ending, and it seems you are expected to be somewhat ""on call"" at all times. There really is no financial motivation to put in more work. You do it just to not get behind, but the extra work does not translate to more pay or comp-hours.

*Training. Yes, there are webinars, but everyone is so busy with so many different things, who really pays attention? Even if you do pay attention, you don't get much out of it.

*Quantity outweighs quality. You are better off giving clients generic answers that don't really help so long as you meet your quotas. Take the time to really help people and it's like you aren't doing your job because your numbers are low. It's backwards. Management will tell you it's about quality, but it's not. It's all about quantity at Symplicity.

*The design of the products are dated. There are plenty of designers, but they always seem busy on other stuff that no one knows about. All the while, the main core products do not get the attention they need. Clients constantly give feedback about how old it looks and how complex it is. They used to joke around that the company name should be ""Complexity"".

*Micro-Management . The CEO still involves himself in everything, creating an environment of confusion and mistrust. Things get decided on long email chains or IMs. Key people are often left out of the loop, but expected to know exactly what to do and how things should function. Additionally, everyone is involved in too many things leaving too much opportunity for mistakes. When mistakes are made, be prepared for direct IMs from the CEO. Management in many ways sets employees up to fail, then blames the employees for that failure.

*HR is not very effective. Most staff have no idea what they do, other than provide in-office employees with ""symp snacks"". Occasionally they'll send a staff email of some new procedure, but most people just ignore or delete the messages. They even asked us to come here to write good reviews because the company was getting a few bad reviews. That should tell you all you need to know about this place.","*Trust employees. Let them manage, stop micro-managing and creating a toxic work environment. If people do 10 great things and 1 bad thing, all you will hear about is the one bad thing.

*Communication is a complete mess. You may get 20 to 100 emails daily, plus multiple instant messages. Everyone is like this and as a result, no one really knows what they are doing.

*Additionally, processes change and most employees are completely in the dark, then expected to know how to perform. This makes employees question what is really going on, and why and who made the decisions that more often than not, do not make any sense.

*The in-house system they refer to as ""Izer"" is dated, slow, and insanely complex. The CEO needs to buy real project management software or invest in a quality development team to modernize it.",2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
