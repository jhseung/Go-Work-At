The company promises a lot and never follows through
This is the kind of meetings we have.... all the time

We here at Sojern realize that it is better to transition compellingly than to target virally. We understand that if you reintermediate extensibly then you may also generate interactively. Think granular. Think killer. Think extensible. But don't think all three at the same time. It comes off as improbable, but it's realistic! Think end-to-end. Think social-network-based. Think B2B. But don't think all three at the same time. Without iteration, you will lack cyber-cross-media affiliate-based obfuscation. We apply the proverb ""Grass doesn't grow on a racetrack"" not only to our macro-out-of-the-box versioning but our ability to reinvent. We will amplify our power to iterate without depreciating our power to cultivate. Our technology takes the best features of XForms and FOAF. Without meticulously-planned e-tailers, platforms are forced to become long-term. Think frictionless. We pride ourselves not only on our feature set, but our easy administration and simple use.

No one was afraid to dissect a problem, find a solution, roll-up their sleeves, and handle the work.

People were treated fairly by senior leaders and were expected to do the same to everyone. The culture was created by the top and instilled all the way to the bottom. Senior leaders were approachable and welcomed it.

I admired how no one ever hid behind an email or approached topics in a passive-aggressive fashion. Open, honest, and direct conversations were the norm and set the tone week over week.

The amount of transparency at this company is second to none. You're treated like an owner and honesty amongst teammates are both promoted and expected. It was such a growing organization when I was there that new employees were being added to multiple offices at any given point. Recruiting did a great job of making sure that the new employees were ""the right fit"" versus growing for the sake of growth.","I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a negative, but things move so quickly that it can be hard to keep up. You are never left to be in place where you won't succeed, but because you're treated like an owner with autonomy, you're expected (as you should be) to do the work that comes with it.","No advice, but thank you for making my time there enjoyable and a rewarding experience. It is evident that the leadership team truly believes in it's people, their abilities, and the company's mission.

When I was hired, I was lead to believe that i would be promoted quickly based on my experience in the industry, but, I was a person who put my head down and worked, and that does not go over well here. It seemed as they promoted the people who 'worked the political system' no matter how many clients they lost, stole work from others, and how much crap they talked about co-workers. I legitimately felt that if I did all the wrong things I would be promoted, and my morals and ethics simply wouldn't allow me to stoop to her level.
Secondly, sales rules all. No matter how much work your salesperson threw on your plate that should be their work, it didn't matter. More than once my salesperson would drop massive RFPs on my plate due the next day, and then post on social media out doing something, and the management of ops was powerless to stop it.

Flat organisation, everyone talks to everyone","I'm very surprised at the positive reviews here. On the other hand, this is an advertising company, and they are keen for everyone to think this employer is flawless, so employees are encouraged to give a good review for Sojern to seem great and win ""best workplace"" awards. Don't you find it interesting how many fantastic reviews has come in to Glassdoor the past six months, a period where more people than ever has chosen to leave?

Unhealthy work ethic:
You are contracted to work a normal 40 hour week, but it's an unspoken expectation of you to work all the time (including when you're sick, on holidays or during the weekend). Although they tell you in the interview that they promote a great work-life balance, you need to be reachable and available to work at all times. On multiple occasions, team members were in the office with high fever, could barely sit up, having the flu, not going home, as they said ""..I need to get this done first, I will then continue to work from home"". It's common to start checking work emails from my phone while still in bed at 7am, and not put it down until going to sleep. Not healthy, and does explain why so many people has left the company this year.

Many reviews here say ""it's fast paced"", that's very true, and it comes to the great cost of the employees who are over worked (14 hour work days are normal). Management will not support you if you start to get tired as a result of being over worked, and will at times then give you even more work just to see if you can take the heat. You need very tough skin to thrive here. It's a very competitive environment in the office, which can get nasty, as everyone wants to do well and stand out.

It's very confusing due to the many changes in the company. Not only is the market fast paced, Sojern has gone through many internal changes lately which makes it a confusing work place. Looks like they attempt to grow faster than they can manage.

Lastly, please note that just because you're a top performer (and can show great measurable results), does not mean you're doing well in the eyes of the management. Sounds confusing? You will know what I mean if you ever work at Sojern.",Please listen to your employees. Don't just listen to what you want to hear.,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0
