Might make sense if you were attending law school/planning on becoming a patent attorney.,"They don't actually have time to train anyone, since they can't slow done the continuous flow of cases from their contracts. Most of their new hires have never worked with IP before, and are either students fresh out of college or various professionals who were laid off or otherwise had a falling out from their main careers...in other words, people with no long-term career plans. The result is a disorganized workflow and high turnover rate. It seems a matter of routine for people to just walk out, and they continuously interview for replacements. There is a disconnect between HR, the admins and the actual attorneys you work with. CEO Frank seems like a solid professional but as an analyst you won't interact with him at all. There is no real advancement, no such thing as a ""senior analyst"", you can just make more money by doing more cases but there is a limit to how many you can feasibly do in a given week. HR will promise you the moon in terms of flexibility and payout on eventual higher-value cases, but reality is quite different when you actually work with the attorneys and administrators. If you go in full-time there is a minimum number of cases you are expected to do, which becomes clear well after you join, and if you have a deficit they'll expect you to make it up by taking on more cases per week. There are no transferable skills to learn here beyond some specialized database searching. This is NOT an introduction to the world of IP or patent prosecution.

In short, this is a dead-end career move for anyone with a STEM background. If you're in law school or plan to be a patent attorney then maybe it is worth a few months, but after that you can leave and they won't bat an eye when you do and simply replace you with some newly-graduated engineering major with 0 work experience. If you put in 40-50 hours a week you might make between 50-65k annually, if you're lucky. If you're unemployed with bills looming that might seem tempting but this is not a long-term option.

2015-09-03, Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Borderline exploitation at times,Borderline exploitation at times,0,"I joined Cardinal out of law school and it provided some patent-related experience to put down on my resume. Many of the HR people, docket managers, and SAO's are genuinely good people. You work from home.","Other reviewers have already pointed out many of the flaws, such as the completely random quality standards which depend on the SAO (search authorizing officer) that is assigned to your search, the general lack of compensation, the lack of benefits, and the lack of any paid time off (that includes weekends, holidays, vacations, sick days, etc. - if you're not working, you are not getting paid).

I will add my 2 cents. During the time I worked at Cardinal, I went from making about 28k in my first year to about 65k-70k the year that I left. The entire time I was there I worked pretty much 6-7 days a week, for about 8-10 hours a day. It is true that eventually you do get more efficient at searching, but there is a ceiling to this and there is a lot of luck (or perhaps favoritism) involved.

No matter how good you are, when you get stuck with a case with 200+ claims (this has happened to me multiple times), you are in trouble. These cases can take anywhere from 2-5 days (one case had almost 500 claims). Unlike the USPTO, there is no mechanism by which searchers at Cardinal can claim undue burden and reduce the search load. This means that from time to time, no matter how good you are, you will end up getting paid $300 (pre-tax) for almost a weeks worth of work. That's $60 a day, or under $8 an hour (assuming an eight hour day).

Unfortunately, these types of cases were not a rare occurrence. I know this because at one point HR and management sent out an email to all searchers telling them that if they spent more than 30 hours on a search that they had to stop work immediately and notify management. This was most likely to avoid running afoul of any minimum wage laws. Think about that. This was such a frequent occurrence that it needed to be addressed at the management level.","There is no structure for advancement, no understandable hierarchy, and no communication to employees regarding career path or compensation increases. In short, this is the definition of a dead-end job. If you don't mind the turnover, keep things as they are - I'm sure people at the top are making a great living.",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Once you get efficient, you can easily make 100k+ if you are doing some SAO work on the PCT (government) side or if you are doing PCS (private side) .

For reference, PCT searches pay about $300 and take anywhere from 5-10 hours. PCS invalidity searches pay about $500 and take about 5-10 hours. PCS patentability searches pay about $250 and take about 4-6 hours. SAO work takes 30 min - 1hr and pays about $150.

Scheduling is very flexible, working remotely is encouraged and in most cases (if you don't live in chicagoland) necessary. Work can be done at any time before the deadlines. Generally can take as much work as you can finish, although you really cannot be late with anything.","If you aren't efficient, you will not survive.

In the past, I've worked for both a big patent firm and as an examiner at the USPTO, so this job is the perfect middle ground between both. It's not anywhere near as stressful as big firm life, and I can make a lot more than a Patent Examiner here.

Remote work
Very interesting and technically engaging projects

I've worked at Cardinal for 7 years now. I started out as a searcher, and made my way up to SAO (senior approving official). The work is very interesting, but it’s not easy. It took me awhile (atleast a year) of figuring out a balance of keeping the work quality up and being more efficient (increase my pay per hour ratio). But once you 'get' it - the expectations and your own workflow - you can really get going. I think the difficulty that a lot of people have (reading through the other reviews) is that they expect the work to be much easier and lenient than it turns out to be. Also I think people expect the training to give them step by step instructions on how to be successful; but much of the skills needed are self-generated (like engineering knowledge and critical thinking) and things each person has to figure out for themselves (like personal workflow and strategies).

The projects are definitely interesting, and the highlight of the work. You work on high-tech, brand-new ideas, not-yet-released products, and cases related to cases going on right now. The clients for your projects are US Patent Office and very large and well known companies. It's a unique opportunity where you’re constantly given different projects, in diverse areas, and for completely different companies all the time. The projects are also task of constant problem solving - every projects are like brand new puzzles to solve. But that means that you have to be engaged and be on-point all the time. It’s very engaging, but I think the grind of that probably isn't for everyone.

I think that many people come to this job as a fall-back - I know I did when I couldn't find a job out of lawschool. Some people also think that they can just pick it up, do some search on half effort, get by, do well and make easy money; and are surprised (then disappointed and upset) at the high standards expected of them. For some, I think they genuinely try very hard; but it's just not right for them, and that could lead to alot of frustration. But I think they tell you right at the start that this job isn't for everyone; and everyone shouldn't think that that doesn't apply to them.

I get it and I’ve been there. It was very challenging to learn my way through things, and I completely agree with some of the negative reviews. But I want to add a perspective that just because some have not succeeded, that doesn't mean there aren't a lot of people at the job who are enjoying the work and making really good money. For those that are able to do this, and fits their personality - like myself - it really is a godsend. I really enjoy the job; and I could never make the kind of money I make now at a law firm or a company.",Remote working can make communications difficult.,Please provide better feedback to the analysts and make performance evaluation more transparent.

I learned this the hard way, having been brow beaten over trivial (non search related matters) in a truly disgraceful unprofessional manner. Did I mention that the brow beating was often administered by administrators who have no clue what the work is all about?

You are paid a set fee of $300 for a PCT search and written opinion of a PCT patent application. You have to do an exceptional job (a thorough, documented search history, mapping every element of the claims to the prior art, filling out the 210, 220 and 237 forms EXACTLY right), and doing all this right takes at least 12-20 hours per search. In fact, I think Cardinal produces the best work of any ISO.

However, this comes at the detriment of Cardinal’s employees. If you work 60+ hours/week, you might begin to take home $60K/year, and that’s after you’ve negotiated the learning curve. The learning curve is steep for those who haven’t searched before and who don’t have knowledge of patent law, but a few months of doing it full-time and you will have learned most all there is to learn.

Most people I knew who worked there full-time were able to complete 2-3 PCT searches a week. Part of the problem is that your searches are subject to summary dismissal by a “Search Approving Official,” so if the SAO finds what he deems to be an error in your search history or doesn’t quite like your primary X reference, they can send the search back to you for hours more of searching/analysis. It takes an hour or two simply to change the citations in a set of patent claims. The whole time I worked there I saw one person make decent money ($100K+) as a searcher and that was because he approved searches as well and was able to cherry-pick the easiest ones for himself. Oh, and I was told that for political reasons we are never allowed to say a claim is novel and unobvious. You might get an application that is the most novel, non-obvious invention in 50 years, and will be told you have to string together 4 references in a Bizarro-land rejection that makes no sense … and again, takes hours to write.

You might be able to get in on their private client searches, which pay $40/hour, but these are also set fee searches. Theoretically, you’re paid $40/hour, which sounds nice until you realize that it isn’t. The equivalent of the search approving official is the “project manager,” whose primary focus is on keeping law firms happy with the searches. So often, you will search many more hours than the “allotted” time because the project manager is unhappy with the results. I will say that private client searches are better than PCT searches.

And forget about any benefits or any chance of promotion.
Promotions: Nobody gets promoted because there’s nowhere to get promoted to unless the owner thinks you can make him more money in a different role. The same search approving officials that were there when I started were the same ones as when I left. The skills you gain working here will not help you unless you can get an interview at the PTO.

Benefits: Zero paid holidays or vacations of any kind. Health insurance is the stingiest and most expensive you can imagine and the Evanston office is a poisonous environment of backstabbing, gossip and vituperative talk. The office environment is terrible.

Here’s another takeaway point. They might change the structure every now and again with some minimum base pay, or by appointing a new “HR” person, but the same people are still running the place. Their core mission is to squeeze all they can from people desperate for a job. Anybody who gets a chance to leave gets out as fast as they can. There is zero loyalty there, and the people who stay are the ones with no other options, or those with very few social skills.

One further point. You might be asking how a contractor with the US government could get away with paying fast-food wages for doing patent examining work. Take a look at the Cardinal contract on the PTO website and also take a look at the McNamara-O’hara Service Contract Act (SCA). The SCA requires government contractors to pay service employees in various classes no less than the wage rates and fringe benefits found prevailing in the locality. So ask yourself what PTO examiners get paid and what are their benefits? I guarantee you benefits and wages are way better in every respect at the PTO. Just look at the GS charts and benefits. Then compare those to what a Cardinal searcher makes.",None,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
2013-08-13, Patent Analyst,,Current Employee ,A nice change of pace,A nice change of pace,0,"There is no other position out there that allows you the flexibility you can find working at Cardinal. The ability to earn what you want and work as you want is second to none.

It takes a unique set of skills to find success as a Patent Analyst. Understanding why you are performing your work in addition to knowing how to do the work is imperative. If you can find such skills in yourself, then you will find success as a patent analyst.

The work is generally on a per project basis, and often pay is determined on an hourly basis. Analysts who show they have an exceptional understanding in both the technical arts and the patent laws are the ones who most often shine.

Cardinal boasts an extremely collegial environment that, for the most part, has a generally upbeat workforce ready to tackle challenges thrown their way. Being part of a team that is able to conquer such challenges is very rewarding. If you are a patent attorney looking for a position that is fun and exciting, but does not come with the strings attached to most large law firm type jobs, you will like this work. At best, stress is minimal. You do not worry about your work while away from your desk or while sleeping because you enjoy it.

Cardinal is a great place to work for the right person, and many who have found success here formerly found success in a large law firm, merely walking away for all of the reasons one can associate with a large firm lifestyle. If you do not have the desire to live with the high stress and lifestyle associated with the law firm, you'll love this line of work.","Every job has its cons. Anyone can find the negatives in a position if they look deep enough. There are other online reviews citing heavily upon the need to work hard on various projects. If you have to complain about working hard, then you'll never succeed - nothing ever comes easy. If you do not like to put in a solid effort everyday, then do not expect to be compensated for what is inevitably less than stellar work.

Other analysts begin the day with a negative outlook, perhaps many have a chip on their shoulder. If you are someone who does not use critique of your work in a positive fashion, or use constructive criticism for what its worth, this job is not for you. Success here is found in being a team player, being open to finding a solution even if it is not your personal first choice. Patent analysis requires the application of logical thinking and significant understanding of the patent system and laws of this country, and if you do not have that you may not find success here (or perhaps anywhere that handles any sort of patent related matter).","If the morale of any single employee is suffering, broader acknowledgement and emphasis of achievements could contribute a boost, but then again what is a paycheck for?",4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0

Can work offsite via company VPN.,"Very significant concerns here: Cardinal IP is directed by a strongly autocratic culture (several/majority of the upper management personnel are from India) that many employees find disconcerting, inconsistent, reactive, and occasionally downright rude. Missives sent out by one of those individuals always makes self-reference as ""the management"" in the third person. Petty, yes, but annoying nonetheless.

Another significant concern: government contracting work--PCT patent searches--require relentless attention to detail that is not remotely ADEQUATELY compensated in the $300 per application pay, which can take up to several days to earn. Those who do this work struggle to reach the $40,000's, usually less. Let it be known to all outsiders: only those in a supervisory position who receive a review fee for each case they oversee, can expect to see a penny more. A little on-line searching will locate testimonials to this effect. And that requires 2 or more years of service. No benefits, a cranky virtual private network that goes offline during peak work hours, and an expectation of being available to receive non-essential emails even on weekends, rounds out the experience.

This work is not analytical. It will NOT teach or burnish analytical skills. It will NOT bolster your resume', unless your next move is to a PTO searcher assignment.

As a final FYI, essentially NONE of the managerial employees with a PTO patent agent or attorney credential are referenced on any issued patents. OK, I found 3 patents co-listing one CIP employee, but those patents were originally authored and filed by someone else. Any outsider can confirm this by running some names from Linked In through the USPTO agent roster. Those who can't practice...search. Cardinal IP is not a place to learn about the patent world. Take heed, nascent patent attorneys.

Bottom line: ok place to learn some very limited and very specialized search techniques, at sub-market pay rates, but virtually no portability of those skills.","Start treating your employees as professionals, and quality and morale will improve.",1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0
