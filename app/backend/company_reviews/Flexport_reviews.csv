I joined this company to be apart of something big. There is opportunity to craft and develop the processes that will guide Flexport in 2, 5, and 10 years from now. Teams are still small enough to make a large amount of impact while also being stable enough that you're not having to do the work for 3+ folks.

- Work flexibility (wfh when you need too)
- The people working here are truly inspirational and amazing. The value of working with folks bought into the same idea as you is very underrated
- Dog friendly! Frustrating day? Pet a dog!
- Solve problems that effect an entire global industry
- Healthy lunches and snacks (although the peanut m&ms kill me in the best way)
- Employee resource groups that the company actually supports
- Diversity is not perfect here but they aren't afraid to admit their failings and openly discuss the strategy to fix the black hole of the problem
- Inclusion is another work in progress and while I see a lot of failings, I also see a lot of drive at all levels to fix

Also, because of this, the only point of pride in being in Ops is handling our largest accounts, even though their measurable success has little to do with individual ops performance. Promotions are incredibly arbitrary, it basically has to do with whether your manager also has upward ambitions & tries to promote himself along with the team. If you're stuck with a bad manager, you never get promoted.

At times, we are trying to boil the ocean with our platform's target market. We need to remain focused on the key business strategies (digital freight forwarding) before going up and down the market too fast (i.e. order management, fulfillment, etc).
- Misalignment between the demand (sales + operations) and product. We need to focus on the paying customer for our product instead of internal supply functions that only focus on reducing the cost to serve (which is important, but the goals are not aligned with commercial strategy). This misalignment has caused a rift between commercial and product that needs to be addressed as soon as possible if we are going to scale effectively in 2018.","- Keep empowering the smart people that you have hired to innovate and drive the company forward.

- Expand functions in SF HQ to other offices as much as possible. This creates an environment that can create true innovations if all the departments can work together on projects
- Bring back Hackathons in some capacity. We were able to get amazing work done in short period and encourage cross functional brainstorming
- Invest in the career development of all the young recent graduates that we have hired in the last 6-8 months. These should be future leaders of the company as we grow and wow - some are very smart.
- Try to get rid of the optical illusion of politics. I do think that the best performers are promoted, but make sure that all departments have the same access to career growth (i.e. customs and finance have been ignored and deserve to have a restructuring and clear path forward).
- For some positions, do not make a college degree required. Freight forwarding is an industry that has some great operations individuals that started working directly out of high school. Encourage those to apply as operations associates and we will have true daily expertise to serve our clients.
- Invest in your women. I have to say that there are multiple meetings that there are mainly amazing women and I am proud to work along side them. Continue to encourage their confidence and leadership. We can be a leader in the tech space with gender parity in leadership and product
- In SF specifically, focus on office culture. We need to have more cross functional problem solving again at the associate level. Other offices have amazing culture when I go to visit, but it is sometimes sad to see how much SF has changed in the last year.",4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

As TechCrunch called it, freight forwarding is unsexy, but that's the best part and why this is an amazing opportunity. The key to success at Flexport is taking the time and effort to understand how the freight forwarding world really operates at its current state. Once, anyone understands that part, its hard to not be passionate about what Flexport's trying to solve. Make no mistake, it isn't going to be easy, the freight forwarding eco-system is extremely manual and like pulling teeth. Change doesn't come over-night and often times, you will have to play along in the manual environment to eventually effect change down the line with our stakeholders. If you are looking to work at a tech startup that is striving hard to effect change and disrupt an extremely old fashioned industry, then this is your place.

As for the workplace environment itself, having worked in conventional freight forwarding in other parts of the country, I greatly appreciate all the perks here! Fully stocked kitchen with beverages and snacks aside from breakfasts, catered in lunches, full on with a salad bar and dessert.

People who work here are extremely smart, come from diverse backgrounds and multi-talented. This place definitely motivates you to be a better person everyday.","This is a new company trying to disrupt an old industry!

If you are part of the operations team today, you are essentially helping clear the way for driving digitization & automation over time!","- More clarity on a career path/success metrics for recent/young grads would help

There are so many career growth opportunities. I've been able to choose between further developing my tech chops, going into management, and starting an initiative from scratch. As Ms. Frizzle says, ""take chances. make mistakes. get messy"".

1) The team is made up of some of the smartest people I've ever met. They're all brilliant and innovative in their own right. They're also all insanely hard workers.

2) Everyone there legitimately believes in the company and the product, and for good reason. The business model is genius and will almost definitely succeed long-term. Flexport's software is filling a massive hole in an old, outdated industry.

3) The company divides the team into a squad model, which is an awesome way to team up and make sure everyone knows how the industry flows together. Each squad is able to divide its labor based on its unique needs.

4) A well-stocked kitchen and catered lunches are a huge money and time saver.

5) The office's location is awesome! It's right in the middle of retail-heaven downtown and very close to the BART station.

6) Management seeks ideas and suggestions from the whole team. This makes everyone's role feel a little more valuable, as ideas aren't simply dished out from the top. Further, the engineering team constantly seeks feedback from the operations team, speedily remedying day-to-day issues.

7) The whole staff has lots opportunities to participate in training. This softens the blow of the steep learning curve, as newcomers have more resources.","1) Echoing many other reviews, the biggest con is the lack of work/life balance. The company is growing as such an astounding rate that it simply can't hire fast enough, and not for lack of want or effort. That said, the hours are long and the demands are very high, sometimes downright unreasonable.

2) In keeping with the above, compensation is far too low for the hours required. When hours and salary are broken down into practical terms, the hourly rate for work is inadequate, especially given the complexity and time urgency of the work.

3) Internal competition can make it too intimidating to use the ""unlimited"" paid time off that the company offers. Also, because the company is perpetually understaffed, taking time off can be impossible; frequently, employees have to answer emails, etc. while ""off.""

4) Managers have a tendency to railroad employees into reporting greater satisfaction than would be genuine. There is an overarching culture of pressure to remain cheerful and avoid dissent. Although they do use anonymous surveys, this is somewhat undermined by weekly face-to-face sync-ups.

5) The social element of the company is pretty lacking (or at least it used to be).

6) The CEO showed far more interest in the software team than in the operations team, even on a personal level. While I understand it is engineering and software that set Flexport apart from its competitors, it's important to remember that, without the tireless grunt work of the operations staff, the engineers would have no demand for their innovations.","Find ways to show greater appreciation for everyone's efforts, not just the ones who are willing to sacrifice their whole personal life for their jobs.

The degree of internal digitization and automation is minimal, if any it’s only working on the customer facing end. The fact that it is believed that Flexport is truly disrupting the industry just shows the lack of knowledge about what’s happening outside the company.

- Lack of fulfilling work: people who went to great universities doing data entry work. If you’re one of the lucky ones to move to a position with more responsibilities you’ll still be overqualified for what you’re doing.
