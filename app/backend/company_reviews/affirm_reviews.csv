2018-12-19, Sales,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Great environment for a seasoned startup professional,Less than a year,0,"Affirm offers a very mature environment - not to be confused with staunchy or boring, but one that is fun for the right reasons (challenging, collaborative, and clean).

The team is incredibly smart, willing to challenge each other in the pursuit of doing things better (and more importantly for the right reasons).

The leadership team is honest and transparent, willing to answer tough questions in front of the whole company, available to offer support, keeps Affirm's values at the forefront of each decision and conversation.

The benefits are bonkers! Free quarterly books, daily lunches and dinners, stipends for everyday (and monthly) expenses, truly flexible vacation time, some of SF's best coffee options, and monthly company-wide outings/events that are actually fun :) You truly feel invested in as an employee at Affirm.","The company is growing at a rate that causes consistent change and communication challenges regularly. This isn't unique to Affirm, just to the time we're in as a company. If you can't handle consistent change, not the place for you.

Our mission runs deep within each team player (which I guess is a pro) but it's not an easy mission and our product is not simple at all. We're transforming an incredibly old industry that touches the personal lives of millions of people and has skeptics in every corner. We have to have hard conversations both internally and externally and it takes a long time to truly understand all of the ins and outs of our business model. Any position you take with Affirm will offer unexpected challenges, which may sound cliche but is truer than most companies I've supported. This isn't so much a con as a be aware that although we've worked hard to make Affirm look simple to consumers, the secret sauce is not.

Sometimes it feels like there are too many cooks in the kitchen for simple decisions. Because of the nature of our product, each project and decision can involve 2 - 6 different teams and multiple people per team. You must be able to navigate internal dynamics, needs, wants, personalities, and do so patiently. This can certainly be frustrating but it's a part of the culture and is something we're optimizing on a regular basis.",Keep the transparency alive. Keep investing in your employees.

Most of the engineers are either new grads or less than 2 years work exp, which is not bad but it creates very jovial and immature environment. There is no good leadership to guide these folks. Because of this, the entire tech stack is a mess and lot of quick fix is done instead of solving the entire problem which increases the tech debt. You can hear people shouting and clapping all the time. Not for serious workers. Lot of people have left in the last 12 months.

Finally, not a deal breaker for many,

2018-08-09, Operations Specialist,,Former Employee ,An org with disappointing values,More than a year,0,Theres sparkling water on tap🤙,"This may not need to be said, but in case there was some misguided hope: affirm is not woke.

Customer Operations is led by very conservative management. It does not believe in respecting overtime pay requirements for non-exempt employees because “labor laws are crazy in California” and “overtime should be for people who make minimum wage”. Management gives warnings about prior non-exempt employees who were “unsuccessful” because they refused to work overtime without being paid for it. Senior managers were overheard by this review writer repeating the anti-labor trope about Bart employees being overpaid. Senior managers praised the US military for its benevolence in an all-team meeting.

Affirm has a strong diversity program which should be supported. It needs to go further. Hiring decisions in Operations are often made by 25 year olds who are not trained to reflect critically on their social/racial biases. Early stage recruiting is also sometimes done by young team members. When senior management gave guidance that the next hire should be a “diversity candidate,” a white European was selected as first interview candidate. Hiring discussions often center around “cultural fit,” which is a proxy for likability; this concept needs to be refined in an org that has made a commitment to diversity. As other reviewers have commented, the majority of employees at Affirm are elite, privileged, and unconcerned with the experience of people outside their milieu.

Aside from all this, there’s nothing very interesting about the product. It’s a high interest loan.",Hire more black men and women,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

2018-06-08, Product Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,An insanely fun intellectual challenge,Less than a year,0,"- Outstanding peers: some of the smartest and most capable people I've had the pleasure to work with

- Positive consumer impact: the strong NPS of Affirm borrowers and powerful stories of how Affirm helped people in times of need are genuinely inspiring

- Solid leadership: the maturity and experience of the executive team really shows up in the confidence and candor with which they lead

- Interesting problems: Affirm's business and tech stack are complex and deep, which brings a new challenge every day

- Strong compensation, benefits, and perks","- Demanding work environment: Affirm isn't for slouches! The tremendous growth and success of the company also means that there is always more to do than time to do it. Managers are very supportive of ensuring you get the time you need to recover, but finding work/life balance requires the ability to set strict personal limits and stick with them.

- Complexity: Affirm's business and technology are difficult to fully understand, even for people who have worked at the company for a while. This can make it hard to get things done, since even seemingly small changes often have knock-on effects in other areas.

- Limited structured career path: As is true of other small-to-midsize companies I've worked at, Affirm doesn't have the same well-defined career trajectory that you'd find at a larger company like Google or Facebook. Especially for younger employees, this can feel scary or frustrating. The upside is that you get a ton of autonomy, responsibility, and rapid career growth if you can chart your own path. The downside is limited support to help you do so.","You're doing much more right than wrong.

2018-07-05,,,Former Employee ,Not so transparent,,0,Affirm at it's core is a great product and I loved being able to sell a product that I believed in.,"My whole team got laid off due to poor planning and vision for the sales team. They laid my team off because of not hitting their quota, and they did so in phases and I was one of the last to go because I was the only person on my team who had never missed quota.

I had almost a whole month of ""limbo"". I didn't have a job anymore so my time was spent trying to find a job internally. My experience interviewing with different teams was honestly terrible. I could tell that everyone I interviewed with had already made their mind up before they had even spoken to me. So every conversation was very awkward, unhelpful and eventually they just became humiliating.

They eventually laid me off, and out of the 50+ people in my department, only a couple people reached out to me after I had gotten let go to see how I was feeling. Mind you, I thought all of these people were not just my coworkers, but friends.

The hardest thing about all of this is that Affirm preaches transparency and inclusion, yet I couldn't have gotten a treatment that was more opposite. I'm tired of tech companies lying through their teeth about values and not actually living them out. Their version of inclusion centers around blowing money on lavish treats after work, fancy team dinners and ""cool"" parties.

And maybe you're reading this and thinking, ""This girls sounds bitter!""... You're darn right I am. I have had wonderful experiences in the tech industry, some of my best friends are former coworkers and I've been promoted due to killing quota. So I know that how I was treated at Affirm is not a reflection of the stellar work I gave to them.",Dont' string someone along and play with their life.,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

* Decent product - the product team is improving with new better product leadership","* Lots of inflated titles. About all the Staff titled are a joke. They have inflated titles with very poor understanding of how things are to be done and how to scale. They only have these titles due to legacy context, not due to expertise.
* Diversity is lacking. I'm not talking about race or sex, it's just that all the people are the same - workaholics, hard to communicate with, snooty top 10 college grads. There was once a hiring meeting when 5 universities were on the screen and people were asked to raise hands if they were from those universities. About 60% people raised their hands and then clapped and nodded satisfyingly.
* Will not survive a recession at this stage - they raised more capital so maybe it's fine now. Remember, it's a payday loan company with cascading effects with how the loans are structured and managed - same as the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis. The company will run out of money very fast if a small portion of the customers default.
* Management is poor. None of the managers know how to empower their employees and make them successful. People get fired for stupid reasons or disagreeing.

Empowering people is not about posh media slogans or awareness campaigns that makes us look good on the outside. It's not about making values and cool logos of them.

Since I have joined in the last few months, huge wins have been made on the business development and sales sides that suggest this company has what it takes to reach escape velocity. As a software engineer, this makes it easy to understand what we need to build and how my contributions will move the business forward.

As important as partnerships are at this company, Affirm remains engineering focused, likely because of our founder. The benefits package, which feels generous for a startup of this size and profitability, caters toward building knowledge and excellence in all areas of life.

Recruiting is top notch, and I was surprised how well the company hires versus both the big box tech companies and other hot startups.

The company is still small (~30 people in the tech organization). These aspects make being an engineer very challenging and rewarding--we are small enough that every contributor needs to learn how to do a lot, with many developers contributing to the full stack.

Each of us need to develop enough awareness of the lending industry and its regulatory components to maintain a compliant lending system. This leads to a serious engineering culture with a big emphasis on automated testing, as bugs in the financial space can have dire consequences.

Everybody on my team is extremely intelligent and great to work with and learn from.

Overall, Affirm is a great place to work as a developer, especially one who enjoys high stakes challenges and developing a large breadth of software engineering skills.","The biggest detractions to working at Affirm relate to the biggest benefits; since the stakes of what we are doing are so high, at times, things are stressful and require us to be extremely focused on our work. In short bursts, work-life balance can be very tilted towards work, although there's nothing quite as satisfying as deploying a financial product that hasn't existed before.

The interview process was very fast and fluid, and my recruiter was highly responsive and communicative throughout, from phone screen to offer. The onboarding process was much shorter and more straightforward than what I've experienced in the past, possibly because it's the first startup I've experienced. One highlight of the onboarding process was that the COO took the time to meet with a small group of new hires to take our feedback on the process and answer any questions we had. Definitely shows the exec team is committed to improving processes. Max also took the time to welcome me, which was a nice touch.

In my admittedly time working here I've also been impressed with everyone I've met, no matter their role or level.

Complacency is non-existent as far as I can tell, and it's apparent how invested everyone is in the long-term goals of the company. Not to be overly hyperbolic, but put simply if the mission and vision resonates with you, then I highly recommend Affirm as a great place to work.",Never enough people to do the work..pretty certain this is an issue every comparable company faces though.

The problems you set out to solve are challenging and large scale. Everyone at Affirm is extremely motivated, collaborative and strives to build great products. The leadership team is one of the best out there and make themselves available to everyone. There is a great level of trust and transparency, and taking ownership is highly encouraged/supported.

All in all, it's a group of talent people who enjoy what they do and make for a great company culture. Best place I've worked.","It's a startup so you'll definitely work hard, but if you love what you do (like the individuals working here) it's a non-issue.",Doing great.

2015-04-28,,,Current Employee ,Dream job,,0,"The people and the mission are the two primary things I love about Affirm. In terms of people, I am surrounded with people who are smart and care about their work. Having the opportunity to work with and learn from so many people that are so good at what they do is a dream come true. With regard to our long-term mission it is daunting and exciting. While we remain focused on our short-term goals, it is exciting to know the clear strategy for achieving our future aspirations as well. I am not so naive to think that path won't change, but having a clear ""North Star"" is important and adjusting the path is half the fun. Just a note on my rating of ""Work/Life Balance""... We work hard because we care about what we are working on and we want it to be successful. Whether you are right out of school or have a family, people with both backgrounds have been very successful at Affirm.","The financial industry is not for the faint of heart. Ex. Building a social network and you lose someone's photo upload it's not the end of the world. Building a financial system and you lose someones money simply can't happen. With this comes a level of responsibility and attention to detail that not everyone may find appealing. That said, I assure you that the challenges you will face and opportunities you have will greatly expand your career and refine your skills.",As we grow and need additional leaders either continue to grow them from within or find people as smart and experienced as you! That management team is one of the strongest aspects of the company and I have learned SO much from them.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
