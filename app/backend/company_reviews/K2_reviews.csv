Now I'll address the elephant in the room nobody here talks about. The software is of very poor quality. The deployment story and upgrade story is horrible. Their labs (their name for engineering) team is run by a petty guy who values people based on personal affinity, not merit. The regularly allow big defects to ship and they are in a constant cycle of scrambling to fix those issues.

Also, they sell it like it can do anything, but it really can't OOTB. Partner services companies that are good have to customize things left and right to make large solutions work. To be honest, you can build solid replacements for simple processes like Expense Reimbursments, Leave Requests, or anything that may have involved email Word documents or PDFs around.

Facilities is great.,"First off let me state that as soon as this message will post, you will see a post by Marketing giving it 5 stars to take away the meaning in this post.

K2 Upper Management - This is the land of misfit managers. People come to K2 so they can get a title and no nothing to provide success for K2. This company gives out Director titles like it's free bottle water. At any other company these people have nothing they bring to the table. All they can think of is bring expensive trainers to train lower staff to have them do their jobs better (Which is no the issues. its K2's lack of leadership). For once I would love to see them take a Leadership for Dummies course. Most of the company sits around and plan on how long until the next Leadership person hits the door or is fired. Trust me it's talked about a lot!!!!

The new CEO seems like a good guy and is trying to drive the boat, but the boat has a massive hole and is taking on water fast. Not sure how long until he taps out and moves on.

In all the years I have been there this is the worse it has been. No Leads, Marketing is out for their KPI's and not Sales. Product marketing, who tells company where and how to sell, and do not listen to the guys fighting the battles. Middle management are just report jockeys and just take off office space.

No career development at all. If you are not brought in as a Director, then there is no chance you will move up or side ways in the organization. The team I am on, no one has ever been promoted in the all the time I have been there. People leave but not promoted.

Would I recommend K2? If you care about the company you work at and want to make a difference then K2 is not the spot for you. Its High Tech Chop Shop. No passion, no drive, and this blotch on your resume will only make you suffer.","Not sure if it is too late for anything to be fixed. Again the CEO is trying but if he looks and see the people below him and what they do each day then he would see where the problems are.

Nice enough people, but the level of disconnect from upper management really is shocking. The most concerning thing though is not even the disconnect, it is how inept they are. As a collective whole, very few people at K2 have any confidence in the decisions being made. In no place is this more apparent than in the marketing department. Think of the laziest person you have ever worked with – that is the marketing team. The question always is, where are the results? To cover up their incredible lack of results, at our last Sales Kick Off, the marketing team hired a band for their whole presentation…. Just like they did the year before! No stats or proposals, but a band.

Couple other tidbits from my tenure:
-The sales team did not have a comp plan (yes, a comp plan) for the last 2 months of 2016 and for the first 3 months of 2017.
-In one year, I reported to 5 different VP’s of Sales
-If you want to advance your career and learn new things and be challenged, I cannot stress enough that this is the last place you want to be.
-Interesting side note: every negative review on here is immediately followed by a 5 star write up that looks like an invite to a job fair…. Nice marketing ☺","I don't think they care at this point... if you have praise for them, they love to hear it.

Product is unique but their offering is extremely late to the game when it comes to SaaS. They still don't have a full-blown cloud offering.","The executive team is constantly changing course. When they do shift priorities every 6 months, each executive explains to their teams in different ways so no one really knows what's going on. I've never seen such disconnect between teams in my life. Department heads don't care or communicate to anyone else. All they care about is their own priority even if it's detrimental to the company in the long term.

None is more evident than the marketing leadership. They are so insecure about themselves that when a negative review is written about them, they go on a witch hunt to the IT team to try and figure out who might have written it. It goes to show you how much time they have on their hands. Last two years, their presentation at SKO was literally them dancing and singing because they have nothing else to offer in terms of quantifiable value to the organization. It's actually depressing as hell to walk into that office every day. The office looks like you're going to your dentist for a root canal. That's actually what it feels like to work there.

Ignore the recent positive reviews the were written by the marketing team. Look at the rating trends and you'll see an overall theme. This company's leadership has either A) no idea what they're doing or B) totally checked out. People are definitely abandoning ship.","None, they won't listen.

good benefits

good technology","Lack of leadership - there are too many people trying to steer the ship, there is a lack of support from all levels of leadership to developing employees. Low morale, high turnover.

Lack of communication - because everyone is trying to lead, communication is difficult to manage. People never seem to know what is going on, and if they do, it changes a few minutes later.

No reviews/feedback - there's no growth here. You come in at what you will leave at, unless you become a golden child, but you'll never know how you are doing.

Employee tenure falls in two buckets - either you've been there from the beginning or you last a year.

The culture is driven by competition, and all gatherings are built upon this. Who can drink the most? Who is the fastest. Who can get the most money. No team building exercises, and no cross departmental gatherings fostering company unity. After a year, I still only knew the people I sat next to daily.

Lack of trust of the employees - constant micromanaging and a feeling of 'not fast enough' in your daily life leads to burn out pretty quickly.

Location is also an issue. No nearby food joints to walk to. You need a car to work here.",Figure out your path or you risk alienating really talented people before they have a chance to do great things for you.,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0

Senior management is being rebuilt and needs to cement itself fast as general feeling around the company is not positive and we are losing great people to competitors around the globe.

Communication has been generally poor over the years but seems to be improving under the new CEO.","Make the people feel like they count and are not just numbers - there are a huge amount of people in this business who have put in many years and they need to feel appreciated again.

Make the staff feel invested in the company and roll out an appropriate stock option plan to do this - people want to stay but generally don’t feel like they have the ability to build something for themselves.

Improve benefits , particularly pension - this is very poor in the EMEA region and lags way behind the market and competitors.
