Office locations are excellent. Working remotely is friendly. You can even travel abroad and work remotely from a foreign office. Smart individuals work there. You’ll probably make a few new long term friends.,"The leadership at the Vice President level is so beyond awful that it trickles down to all teams. They make bad decision like putting lazy people who EVERYONE complained about into manager positions, then make excuses for that choice (e.g. didn’t hear enough complaints or didn’t know how good other employees were yet, etc)! Unbelievable! Different teams refuse to cooperate. It is strange but true. Who is the leader in charge of a project, the ultimate decision maker? No one knows. The team I was on again had someone EVERYONE complained about and he is now the only local person left on the team. He is by far the worst member of the team and should have been fired during the initial probationary period. But that is comScore, good get fed up and leave and the stupid get to eat up salary until the next layoff. The management, lack of processes and automation, and cross team dysfunction have led to a scenario where if you work 10 hours or 1000 hours you get the same amount of work done. The problems are severe, the worst I have ever or probably will ever see in terms of productivity.

* Some of the people were cool.","* Excessive focus on hour tracking, even for salaried employees - including software engineers.
  - There were debates about how to log hours for lunch and holidays in JIRA. Wat.
  - Despite direct managers pushing to keep this extensive hour tracking updated, it was pretty clear it wasn't actually being *used* for anything.

* Silly, useless management decisions.
  - They removed all internal office window blinds in the interest of 'transparency'. Seriously.
  - Continuing decrease in quality and quantity of perks like snacks and drinks.

* History of quasi-criminal shenanigans at higher levels of management that is still impacting the company.

* Weird addition of offshore employees to teams whose managers did not understand why they were getting them.
  - Most of the offshore employees didn't work out, but sucked large amounts of training time down.
  - Caused morale problems and general confusion, especially over job security.

* Decrepit Perl codebase full of broken custom implementations of now-standard Perl modules, meaning there's little to nothing in the way of documentation.
  - Few best practices are followed.
  - They were literally anti-comment for years- you can go for dozens of modules without finding a *single* line of commented code.
  - No one knows what large portions of the codebase are even for anymore.

* Deep, in-grained acceptance of awful, long, and delicate manual procedures for doing all sorts of common tasks; half of the work being done at any given time was manual 'busy-work'.

* No understanding of continuous deployment/integration despite claims to the contrary; going from code to actual deployment has to go through several other teams for manual sign-off or handling by each and the process takes days to weeks.

* First 'all-hands' involved a handful of people cramming into a small glass-walled conference room, while 90% of employees stood outside and tried to watch and listen to what was going on from outside.

* You're ultimately working to help advertisers - you're not exactly making the world a better place. It's hard to wake up in the morning just to make sure your code produces the right numbers for some marketing drone's spreadsheet.","You will simply not be able to attract engineers from places like the big tech companies in the current environment.

Teams can be set in their ways and depending on the team long hours from younger employees and shorter hours from older employees can be common. comScore can try to be everything for everyone and I think that definitely affects my team. The desire to answer every question can takeaway from the ability to answer a few questions more completely. Constant changing of priorities can make accomplishing goals difficult.,Investing in data assets is vitally important and comScore has done so. But investing in people and infrastructure is important as well. comScore hires a lot of recent graduates and almost all of them disappear within 3 years or so. I don't think that's coincidence.

There is a tendency to set goals and tasks by managers providing little direction to team members. The only goal is to get the work completed with no questions asked. When confronted with obstacles such as system limitations you are responsible for circumventing obstacles regardless of the difficulty within the 40 hour work week.

Our business is information yet nothing is shared amongst teams and feedback is not welcomed.

My input was never considered despite the impact this project has on my work and the months of planning and meetings that I did not attend.

The company professes to have a collaborative team environment yet the work primarily falls on those who can do it. People who cannot/will not do the work are usually those held in favor by management. Hard work and a dedication to work are not appreciated.

I worked in the Portland office, which was acquired by comScore when they bought Rentrak. The place was a mushroom farm with a pretty bad/depressing atmosphere to begin with. The company had low morale from years of poor management and was basically a palace of frowns, and an annoyingly meeting-heavy culture did not help. It was also the least diverse place I've ever worked. Almost entirely mopey white guys.

The comScore acquisition made everything much worse. Some of the perks went away, many of the resources needed to do our jobs became very scarce (cloud servers, etc), they made all of the Linux-using engineers switch to OSX and Windows, had a pretty oppressive ""we own all your thoughts"" employment agreement, and many engineers left because of it, myself included.

All of this might have been something worth putting up with if the company was putting Humans on Mars or curing cancer, but at the core of it, comScore is a spyware company. Their business model is based on making it easier to deliver more targeted ads to people and maximize the revenue from those ads. So, every day you go to this mushroom farm where you're doing nothing to make anyone happy or improve the world with barrier after barrier is set up in front of you, and it chips away at you little by little until there's nothing left.

The only reason a company should go through annual layoff is when business environment is terrible or when a company is managed terribly year after year.

Sketchy practices with the data. I have both experienced and heard many horror stories that are pretty poor ethics. For example, many companies take our reported data as an industry standard and report it to many other people. Often this data is knowingly falsified simply because someone ""feels like it"" or it will ""tell a better story"" when our data sets are inaccurate. Any mistakes in the data require fabrication and misleading in order to tell a story to the client and attempt to save face when the truth behind the story is usually a mistake or bad set of data, although that will never be admitted.

Maybe not the most talkative bunch for me, but to each his own.","I've been sitting on this review I wrote eight months ago, but as I just heard that comScore did ANOTHER round of layoffs (almost exactly a year after I was laid off) I figured it was time to share:

The upper-management that runs their ad-ops area should be ashamed of themselves. The company spent a month and a half recruiting me, interviewing me both in person and over the phone. They made me an offer and I accepted. I gave my two weeks at my job and started at comScore the following Monday. At the end of my third week there I looked over to see the girl that I started with putting her things into a box. They had let her go. I was surprised, but what shocked me even more is I was then called into the manager's office where I was greeted by an HR person from the Reston, VA corporate office.

That's right, I was let go. Along with about 50 other people across the company. Corporations are well within their rights to employ people for as long or as short as they wish, but their reputation deserves the hit if they pull crap like this. To add to the hilarity, my severance package was worth more than the time I spent there.

A couple months later comScore reached out to me to see if I would come back as two people had resigned from the department within a week of each other. I asked for more money or a signing bonus. The recruiter had the audacity to say ""if we were to do a bonus it would have to be paid back if you left within a year."" I wasn't the one with the commitment issues in this relationship.

I later found the meeting minutes from the quarterly shareholders meeting where it was discussed that they would be reducing costs via layoffs. An extremely short-sighted solution to appease investors.

Thank God the company I was at before comScore called me up and asked me if I wanted to come back. I accepted that with a promotion and significant increase in pay.

2. While they talk about work-life balance, they don't actually practice it. You're to be ""plugged in"" all the time. They want you online on your company-issued laptop and they ""strongly encourage"" you to set up your work email on your personal cell phone, too. It basically becomes a 24-hour per day job.

Get an email at 2:15AM? You better answer it! If you wait until you get to the office in the morning, you'll be questioned about why you didn't answer it, lectured as to how important it is that you be ""in the loop"" and then

3. Telecommuting is offered, but there definition is a little different. They'll let you work from home, but that's after a 10+ hour day of working in the office.

4. Talent flight. I would hear the conversations in the break room or cafeteria of people who were openly complaining about the environment and their desire to leave as soon as they can. I wasn't surprised when I would hear that so-and-so had left to work for another company.

5. Rumor mongering! Goodness gracious but there was always someone talking about someone else! Now that I think about it, this is tied to Cons #1....

Than Laid Off.,Less than a year,0,"The team that I worked directly with in Marketing was incredible - very knowledgeable, proficient in their role/responsibilities and just really good, nice people. Leadership in the marketing group understood the value of MarTech and how it could elevate our ability to meet our goals and objectives. My leadership also understood my skill set and proficiency and what I could bring to the table if given the opportunity.

Great work/life balance (probably because of what I document in the Cons below)","I was part of the group that was laid off in February 2016. After only 6 months on the job, I was given my walking papers which ended up being one of the best things for my career. It was very difficult for me to actually get anything done in my role - the relationship between marketing and sales seemed to be very political at times. Trying to get new ideas off the ground, while valued, never really happened. There were times where I was ""coached"" on how to communicate with other people in the organization and while I appreciated the ""guidance"", it was this level of micromanagement that made it difficult for me to actually want to share ideas with people.

I worked out of the Toronto office which seemed very stale and dated. There were days where I would go in and a word would not be spoken. I am sure the people there were extremely nice, but because I was not part of the departments that worked out of there, there was no need to talk to me.

It became clear to me after a month or so that my role wasn't really needed in the group that I worked in - as I said in my ""pros"" comments, my team was extremely proficient - oftentimes overlapping with my roles and responsibilities. I never felt like my work was going to go anywhere because of the political nature I experienced - what I thought would be beneficial to the group to understand from a marketing performance standpoint seemed to turn into busy work. The only true project that I felt I got done was helping to get our group nominated for an award based on projects that I was not a part of - I was asked to help with this because the person in my role previously was the one that did it the year before.

I certainly don't regret my time at comScore as it was definitely a learning experience and met and worked with some of the brightest people in my career, however, I don't feel like I was ever utilized properly nor did I feel like I could actually get something done.","Understand the gaps you are trying to fill before you hire a person into a role. If your team is competent enough (which my team was), there is no need to add a layer of management for the sake of it. I am hoping that my role was not back filled for as that person is going to struggle getting anything done.

Upgrade the Toronto office - for a company that talks about having a startup culture, it sure didn't feel or look that way. After getting to see the Reston office, it felt like the Toronto office was a completely different company.

Let people communicate without feeling like you have to protect them (and yourself). I shouldn't have to send an basic email to my management for sign-off before sending to someone else in the same company.

There is high lack of visibility from sales team of the products margins which helps greatly to setup different offers to indiviudal clients. also during the speech. Telco are moving to be customer-centric, but still high percentage of network-centric decissions, and comScore Product, Marketing and Sales miss to adapt the product, and speech for them.

Breaking the Telco accounts by products minimize the effort done by comScore in particular accounts. Big Data is audience, advertising, web and network data...not only network.

Unless you are in the inner cirlce of senior management, you really do not matter. They boast about the free snacks as if that's a good enough reason to consider a company for employment.

The company still operates like a start-up in many ways and as more products, technology, capabilities, etc. have been added to the comScore portfolio, it hasn't been matched with equal focus & organization.

There should be more open communication of certain things. Layoffs were announced about 5 minutes before an email saying comScore just bought a company. The two were probably unrelated, but that's a poor way to handle things.

And speaking of a poor way to handle things, why would you announce layoffs, then not mention until 24 hours later that those who were laid off have already been notified? Doing things that way makes everyone fear for their job. And that leads to low morale.",2.0,4.5,2.0,1.5,2.0,
