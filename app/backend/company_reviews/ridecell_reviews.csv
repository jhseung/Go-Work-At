2018-08-08, Senior Backend Engineer,,Current Employee ,Completely Mismanaged,More than a year,0,"Ridecell has some very interesting opportunities. They have fingers in the ridesharing, carsharing and autonomous vehicle pies, so there's a lot of potential long term to work on some interesting problems.

Generally speaking they have a culture that is the right mix of playful and business minded. I like my co-workers for the most part. And it is easy to not see the problems in the organization as a result.

The company used to be better at encouraging collaboration but mismanagement has destroyed that aspect of the culture.","The engineering department has been seriously mismanaged. After some much needed management changes, the environment never course corrected.

The result is that there was no cultural change and the department was left rudderless for a long time while it retreaded the same broken practices. The current management practices include a command and conquer approach using various levels of micromanagement and a healthy dose of poor communication. Management is more interested in attempting to wear the engineering hat and dictate solutions down to their reports rather than building up and supporting the engineers under them.

The result is a pool of talent that is suffering a major brain drain as the all-stars seek jobs elsewhere. Jobs that once held more opportunities for ownership feel more like mechanical/non-creative work.

Recently, a re-organization doubled down on this direction. This leaves an impression that the management woes are either not understood at the highest levels or they are being actively endorsed.

The remote team has more or less been decimated through refusal to hire more coupled with poor work/communicate strategies. Lip service is paid to how important that aspect of the company culture is with no actions to back it up. I can't foresee remote work being sustained long term.

The organization as a whole can't stick to any consistent set of priorities. The results of which leave the engineering department thrashing wildly from project to project while not actually completing any of them to any degree of quality.

The result of this is that anything that requires a long term strategy such as tech debt or complex feature creation is nearly impossible in the environment. The whiplash of these changes is frustrating. Anybody who tries to act as a stabilizing force to combat it is frustrated, worn out and inevitably quits. There will be some serious fallout when it becomes evident that this is not sustainable.

Tech debt is willingly embraced and it often leads to more problems than it solves. Tech debt is rarely addressed. The product quality is embarrassing and getting worse as the talent declines.","Clean house in engineering management.

The space of autonomous vehicles, carsharing and ridesharing is pretty vast. It will be necessary for the company to pick a sub-space of that and dig in and perfect that. Attempting to ride the middle ground without substantial talent and planning and good management will inevitably lead to failure.

You've lost so many talented engineers and you are not attracting their like in your replacements. This is a strong signal that your culture is toxic.

    ** Tax-free commuter card
* Cool perks:
    ** Daily catered lunches
    ** Monthly cash ""Happiness Allowance""","The benefits and perks may make this outfit sound like a pretty decent place to be.

Don't be fooled.

Engineering:
The culture in engineering is that of a sweat shop. Expect to be on-call 24 x 7 x 365, although this is never mentioned openly. While PTO is unlimited, it is made quite clear that extended vacation is a major inconvenience.
There is no structure to development whatsoever. As an individual contributor, expect to be interrogated on status by VP-level and higher management. If work is deemed to not be moving fast enough, someone will physically sit at your desk ""to help you along"".
Management perpetually swears ""this is the last time we're rushing"" and that the promised land is just around the corner.

Releases:
Release management is non-existent and long-standing feature branches make for nightmarish merge conflicts. Branching strategies are subject to trial and error at every turn. Botched, patchy and failed all-night deploys are the order of the day.

DevOps:
No priority is placed on hiring a capable DevOps team, which is grossly under-staffed with a few mostly junior or mid-level backend developers who are left scrambling to google solutions to problems during on-going production deployments.

Management / Environment:
Upper management seems utterly tone-deaf to the day-to-day chaos in engineering. It seems there are ""management off-sites"" every other week, but they yield little else than hollow proclamations of grand visions for the future. Major holes in the current product offeringare left unattended in favor of the next new and shiny.

There is unrelenting pressure to churn out work and every crisis seems to lead to the next one. Any and all customer escalations are turned into major fires that must be dealt with immediately. Open blaming of both teams and individual contributors and shouting matches during meetings are a common occurrence. Frustration levels are off the charts.

Office space:
Cramped seating, lack of personal space, inadequate toilet facilities and uneven temperature distribution only add to the discomfort.

Lack of cross team coordination impacts our ability to move as quickly as we want to and as quickly as I know we are capable of. I know we are putting in steps to improve this skill company wide but there is a lot more work to do.

There are also things we can do better around measuring performance of both well performing and poorly performing employees. It can be discouraging to others on the team to see someone stick around that is performing poorly. It is demoralizing and undermines the hard work of the top performers.

- Every day holds something new to learn and another challenge to overcome.
- Some nice perks: catered lunch in the office, monthly ""happiness"" stipend.
- CEO is smart, articulate, and shows a lot of care for the company and the people in it.","Our company values have gone by the wayside. Our Engineering management displays a stark lack of leadership--micromanaging and dictating decisions to those doing the work. They ignore the advice (and pleas) of those with 10+ years of experience in the work they're being asked to do and then pass the blame back down to those who didn't meet the deadline.

We are outsourcing in Europe and creating an office in India, but it's not helping to actually increase our ability to find success in the projects we're working on. Engineers tend to follow one of two paths:
1) swapped between projects with poor or ever-changing specs, rarely seeing things through to completion, or
2) working alone on a project indefinitely.

We have standards and processes and best practices, but are encouraged (at times forced) to forego them to meet a deadline or just because someone didn't want to wait. We incur huge amounts of tech debt but don't make time to work it off. Be prepared to work long hours, including weekends with no notice, and be informally on call 24/7 for any piece of software that you made significant contributions to.

Challenging and interesting engineering problems.
Friendly, engaging, and capable individual contributors that are a joy to work with.
Supportive and understanding HR staff and decent benefit offerings.","Incompetent managers without any people management skills or experience, and no accountability for management up to the highest levels. Blame rolls downhill and is placed on individual contributors. Managers are incapable of accepting critical feedback. Gaslighting and denial is the standard response (any concerns are presumed to be the product of misunderstanding), or they'll feign understanding and concern themselves before promptly ignoring the feedback in practice. This makes our ""feedback and vulnerability"" company value at best a depressing joke.

Everything is an ""emergency"" when our customers always seem like they are about to give up on us, so we're constantly cutting corners to implement and ship things we promised them months or years ago at the last minute. Engineers are blamed for the inevitable issues that arise from this mentality, after the initial insult of being ignored or shunned when they provided planning suggestions and realistic estimates proactively. Management is a broken record saying ""this is the last time"" bad planning and practices will dominate, that ""next time will be better/we'll do things the right way"". As you would predict, work-life balance notably lacks respect even amongst start-ups when you're constantly paying for mismanagement.

There is an undeniable and concerning monocultural bias in the company seemingly related to the founders and most engineering managers being recent immigrants from the same country and sharing the same ethnicity and gender. This bias leads to the management being either unwilling or unable to fully comprehend or implement ideals that American employees might value or expect, such as: respecting others regardless of their role in the hierarchy, meeting commitments that they've made to others, having awareness of and taking responsibility for personal failings instead of scapegoating others, giving others the benefit of the doubt when presented with something they initially find concerning or disagreeable, general appreciation for the value of good communication or the importance of employees feeling fulfilled and secure. These individuals do pay lip-service to any ideals that might come up in conversation, but without any follow-through in practice, making it difficult to hope for change. (To be clear, this is a specific problem with these individuals, it's just helpful to see how these problems fit in a cultural context. Of course there is nothing wrong with any ethnicity, and there are many employees with the same ethnicity as these individuals that don't or wouldn't contribute to these problems. The company is diverse, and that is a good thing; if anything, it could stand to be more diverse, especially in management.)

Countless other issues. Severely crowded office, insufficient bathrooms for number of employees (probably not meeting code), unreliable residential-quality internet shared by everyone in the office. Unsustainable tech debt, people doing good work lacking positive recognition, failures being ignored or even somehow repackaged as successes and ego-boosters for management. General inability to have honest conversations in the company (anyone bringing anything of substance up is immediately shut down by management, told to take it ""offline"", and spoken to one-on-one).

In summary, the situation seems hopeless. Management doesn't seem to have the capability to understand how deep our problems go, let alone how to begin to fix them. You probably don't want to work here, and current employees are already jumping ship.

(Lastly, you may notice contradictory positive reviews always show up to rebut negative ones. This is because management actively pressures employees, many of whom have their immigrant visas dependent on their continued employment, to post positive reviews to bump the average up. [Only continuing the trend of tone-deaf management responses to problems.] Beware.)","Learn how to take and constructively apply critical feedback. Maybe begin by assuming that anyone bringing up a concern is correct, and it's your responsibility to adopt their perspective. That would probably have better results than repeatedly asking for justification/""data"" for their bringing the concerns up in the first place before you'll do anything about anything.

Get rid of most of the engineering managers and their managers and hire people that fundamentally respect others and are experienced with actual people management. Choose hires more wisely now and in the future; don't hire jerks. Get buy-in from subordinates before hiring managers (Ridecell is a case study in how poor manager hires can sabotage things far beyond what a single engineer hire could cause.)

Above all, truly take responsibility. When there are problems, assume the blame, don't look for somewhere to place it. The buck stops with you. Ask openly for suggestions for how to improve and do better in the future, and take all advice given to heart without ignoring or dismissing it in practice like you usually do.

The CEO is completely oblivious to how disgraceful the team is run. Projects are routinely micromanaged, late, and of mediocre quality. Specs for new projects are written but rarely followed. At least once per sprint projects will be suddenly dropped or re-assigned without prior notices. Engineers are frequently forced to work late nights and weekends to make up for poor planning and execution. Code on some of the newer products has improved. However, a majority of the code base is a cluster of spaghetti code that is impossible to maintain. Industry best practices are skipped with aggressive and impossible deadlines. While automated testing exists, it’s never effective and only a tiny step up from no automated testing. The company still heavily relies on manual testing for everything.

The office it self is small, very overcrowded, loud, dirty, disgusting restrooms, and unprofessional. Management has promised for close to a year for larger offices. While reiterating new offices are “coming soon” or “we just put an offer in”. Nothing actually materializes from these empty claims. Conference rooms are impossible to book. When you win the conference room lottery you still risk managers reclaiming rooms with short or no notice.
