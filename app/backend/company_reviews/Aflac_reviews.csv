2019-02-28, Insurance Producer,"Frederick, MD",Former Employee ,"High potential, huge risk (insurance producer/sales)","High potential, huge risk (insurance producer/sales)",0,"Commission package is generous if you're able to keep up. Aflac is a great company, they genuinely care about their customers, and want to help people.","As an insurance producer you are responsible for finding all of your own business entirely. It's B2B soliciting and cold calling - 150 cold calls per appointment, 40 doors walked through per appointment are the statistics. If you can get one appointment per day then you'll do great, but you MUST have a drive to succeed and a passion for sales. If you can't manage yourself, and can't make one appointment per day then you will fail, and it is 100% commission as a 1099 employee. No benefits. Either you can enjoy B2B sales and soliciting or you can't, there is no in between with the job. If you can't, then you won't make money. If you're on the fence and need a guaranteed paycheck then find a W-2 position elsewhere. I have it a shot because I liked the idea, I liked the idea of being my own boss. I just couldn't bring myself to ever cold call, I hated it once I started trying it, and door to door was better but I just didn't have the drive for it. Just know what you're getting in to. You can absolutely succeed if you have the drive and the passion, but it's a hard road your first two years.","Feedback I've had from a business owner who used to have aflac: it was impossible to get a hold of the rep and there was no support, it made it seem like all we cared about was the initial money. I think you'd do much better off having dedicated W-2 account servicers, who specialize in account retention. I know a lot of that goes to the more seasoned sales producers, but it's very hard to get a new producer started and keep them onboard long enough to get to that point, meanwhile accounts fall off the books.",2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0
