New executives have decided to outsource the inside sales team overseas and completely cut off the marketing budget to squeeze out majority of the department.

Inside Sales went from easily taking 5-10 new leads a day to barely getting 1-3. Its impossible to keep a pipeline and hit quota at this rate. If you dont hit quota, you DO NOT get a commission check - no matter how close you come. If you miss goal 3 times you are fired.

When these concerns are brought to middle management we were told that there will be many people let go over the next few weeks - either fired for not hitting goal or forced to quit due to not making money. We were advised that those who do manage to stay will expect to make 40-50% LESS than we have over the last several years. Even past Presidents Club reps are struggling to make it this month. I've enjoyed working here over the last few years, but it's become very clear that its time to move on.

In addition, there is zero room for advancement. The average age for inside sales is between 25/30 - we have no older colleagues in the inside account executive roles, because you have to go elsewhere for career advancement.

Work/Home life ratio is incredibly difficult if you want time for a family. Even before the cutbacks, many people worked well over 60 hours a week to take extra leads after hours (many worked 9am-9pm plus weekends). Then we slowly had to start working 60+ hours just to stay afloat. Now every new lead coming in goes to a different country and there isnt even an opportunity to stay late and give it your best shot.

But dont worry, there's unlimited time off now.... but not having a job at all also provides ample free time.

Vonage however does not drink its own Kool-Aid as the CEO likes to use the term, and does not allow its field sales, engineers, etc the ability to work from anywhere, instead they insist on paying for expensive office space.
they recently changed their vacation plan to discretionary time off which is great however they need to allow people the ability to truly work from anywhere and not be locked into a specific Market or office. are Mobility products allow us to truly work from anywhere and most customers generally do not want to meet you face to face except in rare occasions. For those rare occasions travel is the easiest way to go. Save the company money and makes the workforce much more flexible.","Vonage please stop being a two-sided coin. if we are going to sell true mobility and flexibility to our customers we need to prove that it works by actually showing them that our Workforce does the same thing. I had a recent customer during a meeting tell us flat out that their Salesforce does not even meet their customers face-to-face because the customers most often do not want to meet face-to-face they would prefer to do it remote. I wholeheartedly agree. This also allows your Workforce to live or work anywhere. I myself have a situation where I need to move to an area where we do not have an office to take care of sick family and have basically been told I will lose my job if I try and move there because I have to be in a local office.

There are a few slots in the schedule with the possibility of more flexible scheduling. Free snacks are provided. The dress code is casual. You get a few opportunities to learn routing and switch technology and apply them on the job.","The company is growing quickly and experiencing a lot of the pains that go along with it. The different platforms and technologies that are being acquired are merging into one over time, and the transition is very rocky. The workload is extremely high, with employees overworked and expected to try to individually manage 40+ trouble tickets per day, on top of fielding inbound calls (which lead to additional tickets).

The training process is practically non-existent. New hires are given very basic formal instruction, if even that, then expected to pick up everything else along the way. The new products and applications being added constantly are rarely, if ever, included in any training, and often the team is not even made aware they are supposed to be supporting them until a call comes in about it. There are attempts to ease people into the job somewhat by giving a longer time period to work the easier tickets and not being expected to take calls right away, but it's very inconsistent, and some new hires end up doing simple ticket management for months while the rest of the team takes the brunt of the workload. The constant refrain is to ask your co-workers for help, but they are also constantly busy and any training has to depend on how knowledgeable the specific person available to help you is on the subject. Incorrect information will often be spread due to lack of any formalized knowledge or procedures, and supervisors and management do not take charge of making sure this is corrected, or taught correctly in the first place.

Additionally, the systems you need to learn are very specific and require a lot of specialized training, which again is expected to be picked up along the way in bits and pieces.

A lot of the actual work ends up dealing with the specific platforms and can get repetitive and narrow in focus. There are chances to use networking and technical skills, but rarely ever enough time to actually dig into problems and do real troubleshooting, as there is constant pressure to handle all the other issues that are constantly happening and taking calls all the time. As a result, advancement opportunities are rather sparse, as if you do a good job they will want to keep you in your current position.","Invest in actual training and processes, this will keep the people who are actually motivated and hard working who want to learn and do well, rather than burning through people and constantly hiring more while letting others who have figured out how to do so coast along with doing the minimum.",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0

My supervisor was really good at his job to and took the time to train you. He needs a promotion and also thought his british accent was great! Lions is the best team and they have the best SDRs too versus anybody else.
They give you laptop to take home which is kind of cool.

There are no raises at all. During my interview the sales manager there were raises and bonuses. That was a lie.
Not even the team leads who have more responsibility get a raise. $14.33 hourly (what a joke)
There are 2 other supervisors that are bad at their job. One rides a scooter all day and antagonizes people for no reason. Lots of people dislike him. Jumps into your conversation with a customer thinking he is helping you out but making it worse. Doesnt train his newcomers well. Had a new employee complain that he was called out by him at his first meeting for not producing and he was barely 2 days old on the floor. Guy felt threatened by it. He can try to make up some low rated speech about whatever but it doesnt hide from the truth.
The other girl supervisor just sits there all day and usually isnt in the office. Always ""working from home"". Doesnt train team well either.
There is no sense of responsiblity in the job and you do the same thing everyday all day which is a huge drag.
There is a huge turnover rate weekly. Last time I was there 9 people quit in one day. Previous week 3 people quit. Hard on the team to keep morale up as people give up. If you are not comfortable calling businesses and getting denied 99.9% of the time this isnt a job for you.
There is no room to move up. Getting promotions is impossible as they need a bigger staff but people keep quitting. They only pick favorites so if your not a suck up than you will stay where you at.
There have been people there for 2 years and never been promoted. Others who have been there less than 6 months have been given a chance before them which is a shame and a low blow.

Additionally, Vonage is really making an effort to make the shift from a consumer telephone company to a multi-market communications technology company, and are very open to new ideas and new technology.","Because of this transition, there is a lot of confusion over process, especially since different parts of the company are using various forms of project managment. Most of the company has a waterfall mind-set, and this causes a lot of pain for the technology branch of the company that is trying to make the transformation to agile workflows. My experience has typically been that process is favored over productivity. This is partly due to the fact that a company value is unity, and getting everybody into the same workflow is part of the working out of that value. So this is a good and a bad thing, but there are a lot of growing pains nonetheless.","I would highly recommend that if unity is truly a value at Vonage, that you guys focus on good communication and mentoring for your upper and middle management. All of the bad things that I've experienced at Vonage could be easily solved by a quick 5 minute phone call with someone giving me a heads-up, or a department meeting to discuss an overview to a new process change.

The management shows special treatment to some employees and gives them leads from former employees and they also give them specialized lists to increase their chances of passing a lead. Was told that my yearly earnings would be around 45-50k thats laughable. I'm in the top ten of the employees in our department and the highest ""commission"" check i have received is 400 dollars. The leads that you pass to the closer get pushed back all the time if everything isn't exactly perfect because the people over there cannot sell. The turnover rate here is atrocious. People immediately start looking for a job the second they start making calls. The leads they give us to call are never interested and the company is so intensely focused on metrics that people cannot focus on calling the right companies and the results fall through the cracks. The other departments here get treated better than the outbound department. Our manager calls us pathetic and constantly criticizes everything we do. He openly calls people out during meetings if they glance away for five seconds and humiliates them. If you are fresh out of college or have no where else to turn work here. Otherwise keep looking.

2016-12-28,,,Current Employee ,Customer Support IV,,0,The compensation for the job is good. They also have a snack room filled with an assortment of drinks and food.,"Vonage has a lot of issues. In my interview, I was never informed that I would be working in a call call-like environment and that we didn't really do that many technical activities. I had been informed we would do more networking and that the company would actively work to help you advance. As time went by, my supervisors kept stating they would let me shadow another department, but never did. The job I have involves taking call after call. The system is setup poorly so that some techs game the system by closing tickets before the issue has been resolved and telling the customer to just open a new ticket, thereby, making their metrics look better. These technicians receive a scolding, but continue to create more work.

The metrics that Vonage has are hard to meet if you aren't closing password reset tickets, closing tickets without verifying that the customer is satisfied, or just flat out game the system. It gives the impression that Vonage cares for little else, but numbers since they make little effort to deal with the problem of cheating. Employees are even sometimes rewarded with PTO if they close the most tickets even by cheating!

They also do not train us and leave us work amongst the techs to figure out a technology that no one told us we would be supporting. Even after merging with another company, we received zero training on that company's technology, while the other company received training on our's. We have repeatedly asked management for training and they stated that we should just ask our peers. Instead, we are left floundering and wasting time unsure of what we are doing.

There is no option to work from home (despite the fact that we are running out of seats for our technicians), but Sales can do so. We are constantly cleaning up Sales' mess when they tell the customer that certain things can be done when they can't due to Sales trying to meet their numbers.

Vonage is constantly having outages, so we are often dealing with angry customers. It is frustrating when the higher-ups, including the CEO, brag about how great Vonage is when Support sees little improvements in infrastructure, in training, in benefits for the Support team, in standardized processes, among other things. All Vonage cares about are their Sales departments and it shows with all of the parties and the perks they are given.","Actually, train your employees instead of leaving them to fend for themselves.

several people undeserving got promotion despite having worked there less than the required time (wining and dining)

they threw out technical standards. there were several tools I had when i came in that were removed and given to some guy in india, or utah, or virginia.

because of their obsolete call center metrics system, several people straight up quit. One guy just walked out in the middle of a call and didn't come back.

Everyone is stressed out over the 70-80 customers waiting at any one moment who then trash talk us because well...we sucked.

Vonage had the opportunity to hire one individual, who in my opinion, is a great leader. This individual could have contributed immediately from day one. But due to a 10 year old felony conviction, Vonage has passed on this individual. Never mind the fact that this individual had already been working on this platform for 3 years and lead the repair of a relationship between Vonage and it's outsourced partner J-Curve.

Now Vonage has relegated itself to feeding at the bottom of the barrel for talent who have familiarity with Broadworks. It now feeds on those who have been fired from previous jobs who have experience with Broadworks","Here is my advice - while people do make mistakes in life, it might be wise to get to know the individual instead of making a decision solely based on information in black and white.

2016-03-04, Tier II Technical,"Marietta, GA",Current Employee ,"Poor Management, Poor Choices, Poor Policy, Poor Healthcare Benefits",,0,The coworkers. Never found a better group of technicians to work with. They make the company somewhat tolerable. The Senior technicians dont look down on the technicians but instead work to fix the issues you have.,"Worked there for just over a year and the company went from an awesome place to work for to what can only be called 'A Resume Stain' Im sure you know the companies, when someone looks at your resume and says ""Oh worked there...Im sorry for your pain"". Poor management that spends more time lying to the techs than actually fixing problems.

Changes to Work Force Management and to Compliancy make actually helping the customer impossible. The Management believes you should be able to fix a companies network, and setup phones in less than 18 minutes. This leaves technicians to do the bare minimum to make sure they stay within compliancy or you are written up, fired, or stripped of work from home.

Constantly being told there are promotion prospects but when promotions come up they are given to people outside the company with no clue how to manage a tech team or worse, sent from the main office to institute more draconian policies that make little or no sense. This is what is called 'Glass Ceiling' and with the poor management lying every time a prospect comes up it makes the techs feel under appreciated.

We are expected to follow QA to make sure we are doing the job right but have no way of seeing the score unless you screw up. This makes it impossible to actually improve yourself. They instituted a new QA system, still cant see anything but now are threatening immediate failures if certain things happen such as communicate in Hiphat(means of getting help) talk to someone else during a call.

The goal of Homedale,NJ (main office), is to close out the Atlanta office. They are constantly place techs in the queue from the main office after bare minimum of training and they tend to cause more problems than solve. Poor performance of these people cause more problems.

Poor testing has caused large gaps of time on companies systems where they cant use part or all of the phone system. Prior to Main office jumping in and 'helping' queues were usually 5-10 techs waiting on a call which made talking to a technician quick and efficient. After the 'helping hand' we usually have 20 - 100 people on hold with 15 minute wait times in the busy part of the day.

The company is hemorrhaging technicians and talent. They dont seem too inclined to fix the issue but instead blame everything but the poor management practices.

With in the next 2 years the company will be phased to an india call center due to cost.
If you are a tech. dont bother. If you are a company dont jump in with them its not worth the cost you will incur to your company to be treated this way.

Now we come to Healthcare. About 3 months ago they decided to change healthcare coverage. Those who took HSA to offset costs are still over a month behind on the money. Apparently the not so bright powers that be decided to implement and not have anything in place to transfer money. At present there are quite a few diabetics and other people with medical needs that need prescriptions filled constantly. This is all coming out of pocket since Vonage stole the money out of the HSA accounts. They promise it will be 'fixed' but unless you threaten to report them nothing gets done. Technically they are working on the issue and will fix this...but three months is long enough. Most people believe that if the money is not available due to misappropriation it is theft. Vonage beleive it is a slight inconvenience. I have had to contact the VA on several occasions to get prescriptions filled. Luckily they have stepped up to help me fill the prescriptions i need to function. It really is amazing that the VA has a more reliable healthcare plan they Vonage does.

All in all dont work here. There are better jobs and right now the tech department is looking like a ghost town. They cant keep techs due to policy and outright mistreatment. Their goal is to gut the Atlanta office and move it overseas and to leased call centers where cost is reduced. They dont care about employees or customers at this point.","Quit, you cause most of the problems in the company.
Fire any supervisor who cant pass the standard tech training test every tech takes to get in. Start promoting from within, a tech works better if he knows he has a place to go and a goal to work for. When you kill off incentives and promotions it shows them you feel they are worthless and not worth your time.

At heart its a software company that has to move faster to stay up with competitors. There is also a difficult cultural environment that is drive from executive where differences of opinion or simple facts about the market or a product are perceived as a threat or are discarded. Any company has resource issues, but the inability for some executive to listen to solutions on these issues or change the company's culture led to a number of good people leaving the organization in frustration.

HR will acknowledge that you are underpaid, but then never do anything to correct your paycheck. Positions aren't given to the best candidates, instead promotions are handled politically.

Lack of communication across the company, especially to the Care Organization when products are being launched, which often lead to poor rushed roll outs where most individuals are not prepared because most information is missing up until a few days before roll out.

The company claims to take employee feedback, but I couldn't tell you the last time I saw an employee suggestion that was acted upon. There's an annual ""Great Place to Work"" Survey, which most people are told how to answer.

Management does not always appear to support the worker or their growth. You will be given a yearly goal to improve your skills, however when you present your manager with options, they are often declined because of budgetary reason and are instead told to just read articles on the internet

The only way the company is able to make money is to consistently raise prices on existing customers. Poor marketing department that doesn't know how to attract new customers, which is causing tenured customers to leave due to raising rates. It's like they don't understand how business works.

A LOT of layoffs recently, and the process by which people are laid off appears backwards. Many of the harder workers with strong work ethics are laid off, while the people whose job function you couldn't explain no matter how hard you try because it's a made-up role or people who truly are poor performers are kept on board. When they let you go, they tell you that you no longer match the job description, but when you ask for the new job description, it's what you are currently doing.","Take a good look at the entire organization - do you really have the right people in the right roles?

The company itself is still in its infancy but so far has built up a good client base and there's deffinatly a room for growth somewhere down the line. The free lunches we get on Friday is a great bonus compared to a lot of other companies out there. The people and management are easy to speak to but sometimes difficult to get anything done when a change needs to be made. Its one of a few companies that I can say im happy to be working for.,"The location in Canada is not the easiest to get to, Sometimes the multiculturism of the hiring makes it hard to relate to some of the other employee's who work here. People in the higher positions have a high turn around rate so its hard to figure out who's in what position. As of right now there isnt to much room for growth if your in a lower tier position. Some of the application we use are quite slow and need to be updated to a more modern type system. All in all still a good employer.",Improve the systems were working on. Listen more closely to the employee's. Work out some of the bugs in the product to improve the customers use of the system.
