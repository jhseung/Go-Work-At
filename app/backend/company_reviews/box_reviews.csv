Most individual contributors have been burnt on empty promises. You’ll soon realize that you’re really just a chess piece amongst dueling VPs and directors. May the odds ever be in your favor. You might just luck out.

In addition, former acqui-hires who left the company were threatened via lawsuit because they left too quick. Seriously Box, they left because y’all treated them like BLEEP.

If you don’t believe me, I’d encourage you to reach out to former PMs before accepting the job.","Pick a product strategy. Our PM leaders are power hungry, and they’re making selfish decisions, causing fallout for everyone else.",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0
