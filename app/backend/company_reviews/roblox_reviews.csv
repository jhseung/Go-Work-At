Very efficient recruiting process, Bette is definitely the best HR I have ever worked with. She is always pretty responsive, helpful and considerate. I also had a CEO interview for a non-manager role, I can tell this place really respects and values their candidates just from the recruiting process.

2). A lot of delicious snacks, drink, and fruits in the kitchen. They even have some ice creams which I like the most. Free lunch, a lot of choices. You can order delivery with eatclub too when you are too busy to go to the cafeteria.

3). Good for my career. I am working on the platform played by millions of users, this makes me feel very proud. A lot of challenges need to be taken as well, I believe I can learn a lot here.

The kitchens are fully stocked all the time, we get free lunch at the cafeteria on campus, and there are a myriad of benefits available like gym reimbursements and a headphone subsidy. It’s a cool place to work.

As a woman, I feel generally respected and feel things are much better than other tech companies I’ve been at as far as gender inclusion.","And then here’s the onion: cool place to work while you actually work there.

The company leadership likes to keep things about “values”, which in essence they use to explain away the lack of any sort of structure and tangible leadership. Some of their mottos are “get it done” and “own it”, essentially putting every point of failure on the employee and letting leaders wash their hands of any sort of leadership responsibility.

This leads to an environment where a hot topic among employees across the company is always about who was just let go, or who might be next. Anxiety about the security of their jobs is a common characteristic among the workforce here. Every week there are people let go for who knows what.

Remote work is a huge no-no somehow still in 2018. There is also the PTO scam where there is an unlimited policy merely to make sure there is no obligation to pay employees for the PTO they don’t take, knowing many teams here generally don’t take the time off.

Let’s just say my exhuberance since I started has since worn off in a big way.","You’re truly onto something big, and you know it. But you’re also doing it in a way that may come back to hurt you later.

Good youthful culture. Roblox is amazing company with tons of amazing people and is a great place to work. Its potential is truly underestimated by the public and the media. This “kid’s platform” has games already competing with top steam titles in terms of player counts and revenue, and it is still growing. Roblox has an incredibly liquid corporate structure and that makes it a fun place for flexible people who like to take initiative to work.",Roblox maintains a virtually impenetrable monopoly due to countless patents and ten years of platform development. That allows senior management to be lazy and make serious mistakes but still the company keeps growing. A lot of the company (mostly business side) doesn’t really have a good grasp of what the platform is. This leads to frustratingly poor business decisions that are completely out of touch with the UGC nature of the company.,"Roblox’s heart and soul is user-generated content. Stop making decisions that push the company away from that. Roblox’s venture into merchandising reeks of last century thinking. For a company that exists by subverting the common practices of the video game industry, seeing it to subscribe to those same practices for merchandising is painful to watch. Kids don’t want to go to Kohl’s to buy generic Roblox-branded shirts... They want shirts from their favorite games, and no one is more suited than to make those than the developers behind those games.

2018-06-04, Senior Software Engineer,"San Mateo, CA",Current Employee ,Great place to be,More than a year,0,"Roblox is a very comfortable place to work at. All usual stuff that you may see at other successful companies are present: snacks, paid meals, flexible/unlimited vacation, 401K matching etc. Personally I chose Roblox over facebook and google not only because I got a better (or matching) offer from Roblox, but also because I felt that I'd be lost in a huge army of Facebook/Google employees possibly working on something not so important. At Roblox I work now on something that instantly affects entire platform and tens of millions of players and I like that. At google/facebook I'd be getting shares that can be sold for cash any moment, however their value is unlikely to increase tenfold over 4 years. With the way Roblox grows I'm fairly confident value of my options will increase more than 10-x over 4 years of vesting period. Yes, Roblox is not a public company, but it's on a good trajectory to become one: we grow consistently over multiple years in revenue, in user count and retention; Roblox just started to expand worldwide and we have a good CEO and top leadership team. I've been at Roblox just a bit less that 2 years and I'm happy that I chose Roblox over all other options when I decided to move to SF Bay area.","Perhaps our release cycle isn't something that I'm happy to deal with or our versioning system.

So, join us and help us make it better!",Some software engineers have identical title at Roblox but have uncomparable level of experience and skill.

Good benefits: free lunch, 401(k) match, good insurance","The company has obviously grown without the influence of an effective CTO:

Since teams are expected to self-organize without a common set of standards, there's a great deal of variance in code quality, hiring process, stack, project management, and titular responsibilities among teams.

Little tooling, and what does exist is nonstandard - everything from pulling source to testing on staging or pushing updates to production is needlessly painful.
Weird restrictions on # of concurrent users accessing staging resources which bottleneck feature development.

Lots of intractable tech debt left over from bad architectural decisions in the past - slower velocity per engineer than many companies in the valley.

Devops and Corp IT are understaffed and lack automated tools for the volume of people they're bringing in.

Culture and advancement glorify tenure over aptitude: some senior people who should be in different roles.","Get someone in the C suite who can weave all of these teams together and address the architectural issues. Roblox is a software company and needs someone more empowered than a VP to oversee technology. Having a conductor does not make an orchestra less self-organizing, but lacking one really shows.

This creates a work environment in which there exist wonderful feedback loops every day, from users and developers who work hard to support the platform and amplify our efforts, to company meetings in which we see our success quantified month over month.","""Downsides"" are always tough to articulate because it forces the implication that something is wrong. Here are some of the things I often share with people I am interviewing to help them complete their picture of the company:

1. Roblox is not a start-up. We have been around for over a decade, and don't always have the agility of a start-up, even though it still feels like a start-up in many other respects.

2. Many, many of our users are kids. This informs all the decisions we make, and in some ways impacts our agility, as we must be much more mindful of the changes we introduce. But as a parent, I am glad to work for a company that takes the issues relating to child safety and security so seriously.

3. Roblox does not make games. We make the platform that others use to make games. This is not a ""con"" or ""downside,"" but something many don't always realize. In fact, I often say, ""what YouTube is for videos and video producers, Roblox is for games and game developers.""

4. Roblox values people who work on-site. There are those in the company that work remotely, but it is the exception, not the rule. And while the company is open to discussing individual's needs, and accommodating to personal schedules, from what I see: if you live in the Bay Area, it is highly encouraged for you to come into the office.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,

ROBLOX is a real meritocracy, where hard work, passion, and results win over everything else. You're constantly learning, and constantly improving. People are well rewarded and praised. I see some negative comments on this site about retention, but retention has been great from what I see, and we've doubled in size in less than one year.","I think there are downsides for those who cannot adapt quickly, who are not flexible, or who are not able to consistently deliver. For these people, ROBLOX can be a challenge. ROBLOX can also be a tough place for those uncomfortable with a narrowly focused, highly iterative approach -- employees must be able to tolerate off-scope ideas being placed on the sidelines, and having interim results being ""works in progress"". From what I hear, ROBLOX is no different than other dynamic and successful tech companies.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,
