Most people have been here for a few years at least and there are also a lot of new people comping on board for new positions.

Location is amazing, although I do not have a statue of liberty view like some of the execs do :) I commute from Brooklyn (sheapshead bay area) about 40 min.

Culture is very easy going - you work from 9 till 6 with an hour break in the middle for the most part. There is occasional travel to shows and such.

Overall I have been here for 3.5 years now and I do not think I am going anywhere anytime soon.

Benefits are generally standard - vacation, sick days, health etc.","Nothing is ever perfect,so I would not say there are no cons.
