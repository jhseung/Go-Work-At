2019-04-09, Regional Sales Director,,Current Employee ,Amazing Opportunity - Great Company,,0,"Joined the company less than 6 months ago, great company culture. Being part of a company that is being disruptive in the SIEM market is very exciting. Fast paced environment, you are the ""quarterback"" running your deals. Every person in the company is focused on making sure you are successful and you if you need help to win a deal, they are there. We win together or we lose together. Compensation is good, benefits are competitive, full transparency from leadership. If you have an opportunity to join the company, jump on it.","Not really any cons, as a fast growing pre-IPO company, the pace is fast. If you are waiting around for someone to tell you what to do, this is not the company for you.",Keep up the good work.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2019-04-05, Regional Sales Director,"Atlanta, GA",Current Employee ,It's a wild ride...probably the most fun I have had in years,Less than a year,0,"This place is awesome - we are solving a real problem created by legacy SIEM vendors and not only are we helping our clients improve their security posture, but we are helping them save money at the same time.

From the very top down, there is a culture of excitement, passion, transparency, accountability and a shared vision. ""That's not my job"" are not words ever heard around this place. Everybody is fired up about what we are doing, there is a feeling that we are really making a difference and we are having a lot of fun in the process. That is why I like this size of companies - more than 100 employees, but less than 1,000 - everyone is empowered, there is no place to hide, the pace of the work is exhilirating, no two days are the same and the little speedbumps along the way make the successes that much sweeter.","I wouldn't really call this downside (at least it is not for me), but if you can't handle a bit of chaos, can't think quick on your feet and don't like to work hard, this place may not be for you.","As the company continues to grow, don't lose the passion for our customers' success. A big key to that will be continuing to hire people who share our vision and who are a good fit with the company culture.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-02-23, Sales,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"This isn't hype, this is history in the making...",More than a year,0,"One of the best sales & engineering led leadership organisations in the industry, bar few; A solid and relevant product offering, with the strategy and execution to match. I appreciate that some of you reading this will think that as I'm a current employee, that it's likely I'll say positive things; well, rest assured that's not the case, I took this job on a pay cut, because I've not seen this level of product vision, execution and sales capability, since Netscreen, Fortinet, Fireeye, Palo-Alto and Splunk.... The culture is no-nonsense, you work hard, you perform, you give it your all, you'll make it; this business has been built on the ethos of ""whatever it takes"" and ""we're in this together""; it's that drive that has seen the biggest financial and customer acquisition growth, in the pre-IPO market this past decade.","As with the very few vendors who have been through this level of hyper-growth in the past, there will be teething issues across all parts of the organisation, bu rest assured everyone here is a AAA player and performer; we recognise our mistakes early and suffer fools rarely... Be prepared to work harder than you've most likely ever done in your career so far, but in return be prepared to leave a mark in the industry and few will ever match in your life-time...","Maintain the focus in the key areas that will ensure continued product growth and functionality, continue consider the direction, ideas and strategy input o those in the org that have significant start-up and GTM experience at early stage growth. Trust your gut instinct at C level, whilst we continue to forge a path that few have ever come close to matching....

2019-04-02,,"San Mateo, CA",Current Employee ,Disappointing Experience.. Do Not Recommend,,0,"Exciting vision to disrupt an antiquated market
Lots of positive hype around the company","Low morale across many of the company’s business functions from Customer Success to Professional Services to Sales. The product is very complex and not stable (extremely buggy). Every team is feeling the pain because of this.

In fact, Engineering is slowing product innovation to focus on the quality issues. We are forced to constantly work in firefighting mode. Internal training is cancelled frequently, as support must jump on P1 customer cases due to product failures instead.

Boys club culture at the top level. They brought an inappropriate comedian to a company event that made racist and sexist jokes. It was disappointing to see leadership standing at the front of the room laughing along.

Not the “rocket ship” I was promised.. I hope they are able to turn things around.",Make the product functional and simpler. You won’t be able to scale with the current product design.

2018-09-21, Director of Technical Recruiting,"San Mateo, CA",Current Employee ,Exceptional,More than 3 years,0,"I’ve waited nearly 3 years to write a review about Exabeam.
Exabeam is the most exceptional venture I’ve ever encountered.
People/culture: Smart, high-performing, low-ego, high sense of humor, and 100% integrity and trust. Exabeam is the most radically transparent company I’ve ever come across, and I’ve asked hundreds of candidates whether they've ever heard of a company as open and the answer is always “no.” Not even close.
Exabeam operates at high velocity in every aspect.
Exabeam is highly successful, and success is palpable throughout.
I’ve never dreaded a Monday morning or having to go back to work after vacation.
It always feels great walking into the office.
Moving to a new company is scary because you don’t know what the place is indeed like until you’ve been on board a few months. Rest assured, Exabeam is an excellent place to work.","From my perspective, zero negatives",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

This place feels like I hit the jackpot. I have never been apart of a company with amazing leaders, because of who they are and their values it has affected the culture and people in a very positive way.

This place is very special, there is high transparency, growth opportunities, support, and trust.

There are truly genuinely kind and smart people in the office, it affects you in a very positive way.","Of course there is growing pains, but I see this as a good thing especially at a 5 year old company.","Please try your best to maintain what has been created at Exabeam -- culture.

2018-07-16, Vice President Sales,,Current Employee ,"If you're lucky enough to get the offer, DO NOT HESITATE to join this company.",Less than a year,0,"Where do I start....?

1. A hi-tech cyber-security startup that brings strong value to it's customers with a product that works out of the box. For sales and sales engineering, it doesn't get any better than this.

2. An approachable senior management team that truly listens to and respects everyone in the company no matter what their position. Even if your suggestion or concern is not agreed with you'll get a thoughtful explanation and treated with respect.

3. Very competitive pay and benefits. A-players are paid accordingly, and I'm a little jealous of those who work out of HQ. The atmosphere there is great every time I visit.

4. Internal office politics are non-existent. We win as a team, we (very seldom) lose as a team. The way this company forms up to support a customer pre-and post-sales is impressive to say the least. Again, all the way to the top.

5. Been in this industry 22 years...rarely can it be said that every member of a Senior Management Team, or Product Management, etc. can be brought to an account with confidence, knowing they'll bring value to the customer.

6. A true family atmosphere.

7. Sworn to secrecy on the numbers...but lets just say ""Explosive Growth""! It's pretty darn impressive.","Not a con, just a warning. This is FAST MOVING, high growth company. There's no place to hide, and you will work hard here. The good news is, you'll be paid well, you'll enjoy it, and the end goal will all make it worthwhile.",None,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2017-11-19, Software Engineer,"San Mateo, CA",Current Employee ,"Fast-paced, challenging and fun.",More than a year,0,"Lots of hard-working and autonomous people in every org, huge emphasis on transparency & results. Leadership has a laser-like focus on company goals and their can-do attitude is infectious. Every team has high willingness to go 'all hands on deck' for top priority projects. Very fast-paced and lots of work to be done but most people are still able to retain a good work/life balance (lots of employees with family at home). Culture is 'silicon valley startup' without being ridiculous, which is a hard balance to achieve.

Tons of smart people in engineering with a variety of backgrounds. Can learn something new every day (front end, data science, backend, devops, all within 200 feet of each other).

One unique attribute - huge emphasis on product design, which is leaps and bounds ahead of most enterprise software I've used and worked on.

Highly recommend Exabeam to engineers who want to hit the ground running & make an immediate impact.","Location is somehow super central yet still far from where everyone actually lives :) This seems like a bay area problem, though. Otherwise, not much to complain about. There is always a lot of work to do - this could be a bad thing if you can't keep up with the pace.","Keep on hiring talented, hard-working folks. As the company grows with the new products, it will be harder and harder to bring the right people aboard. Also, don't be afraid to emphasize quality over time-to-market in certain key areas of the product.
