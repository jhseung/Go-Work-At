- Pay is ok, perhaps below industry levels but benefits are good","- Far away from the City. Lab is pretty much in the middle of a forest away from most things. Getting here can get cumbersome. Traffic on I-55 can be killing in both directions.
- Bureaucracy defines everything here. Tons of paperwork to get anything done which means sometimes the place is a graveyard of great ideas.
- Nothing moves fast. See above.
- Pay is lower than industry scale. Most people are here for the science and mission. It sort of compensates by offering good benefits.
- Most positions have no room to grow. People stay on in their positions forever and leave only when they retire. Can get frustrating for young and ambitious achievers.
- This is not intentional, but diversity is some what lacking in leadership and across the lab.
- Science and scientists drive everything at the lab, everything else resolves around supporting the science and can sometimes be relegated to the background.
- some of the facilities are truly truly ancient from WW2 era...",Keep doing what you do and take your staff along. You are doing great to keep Argonne the great family friendly facility.

2. Not many ""managers"", ""directors"", ""program managers"", etc. Those that are there are quite technical and don't engage in ""business-speak"" and buzzwords.
3. Don't waste time with a lot of meetings
4. Great engagement with industry and collaboration
5. Work on interesting topics and can shape your own research
6. Amazing work-life balance (35-40 hr week typical). People don't bother you with work-related emails or phone calls outside of work
7. Very nice offices (buildings from the 60s, lockers and showers on every floor, not yet transitioned to open-office space, but will be happening soon)

16. Easy access to upper management through email, townhalls, etc. Good transparency and inclusive culture
17. Really good leadership
18. Nice health insurance, dental insurance ($2000 one time orthodontic coverage)
19. Good mix of basic science, research, and applied technology. Lot of support for tech-to-market and working with companies to commercialize tech","1. Located in the suburbs, about 35 mins from Chicago, but you go against traffic if living downtown (minor)
2. You will get about 10-15% less than in industry for a full-time job (not postdoc -- they get paid ~70K). No bonuses, stock options, but higher 401K contribution compared to industry (9% vs ~5%) makes up a bit for this.
3. Depending on your group, it might be hard to make progress in your career. Most promotions based on tenure rather than merit, though the really top performers can get on the fast track. Should always be aiming to build up your skill-set and resume, and not get complacent. Try to grab any development opportunities like leadership training, etc., and also be able to get a job outside of Argonne for leverage if needed.
4. Your job security and career progress is dependent on success in proposals (which can be out of your control), unlike industry where you typically don't have to worry as much about funding issues.

Have to be able to bring in your own funding if you want to make progress, which can be hard in the current federal funding scenario.

What should be regarded as the golden goose at Argonne is the atmosphere of collaboration and camaraderie. Working every day with the people there was an absolute pleasure and can be found nearly no where else.

+ Top level technology/institutes to work with (CNM, APS, HPC resources, etc...)
+ Casual, jeans and nice shirt environment
+ Easy/flexible hours, decent vacation
+ Independence in projects. You can get it done how you want to, and generally pursue as many rabbit holes as you would wish.
+ Good for networking.
+ Division management is generally good, and promote via merit, rather than seniority.","+Safety culture can be overbearing and inhibits work. Some SME's cite irrelevant standards to give the illusion they know what they're talking about. Thankfully this is only a few.

+ Massive low balling for pay. Upon going from a post doc to a real job I netted nearly double the pay (new job is in Chicago too). Current salary is about 20% more than I'd make if I were staff. I'm not sure what their market studies comprise, but they are inaccurate.

+ No permanent jobs for post docs, and low pay cause some good candidates to go elsewhere. There is nothing worse than getting ""PhD minimum wage"" only to be kicked to the curb at the end of 3 years. Good PIs will help their postdocs find positions, but that is not guaranteed.

+High turnover of post doc workforce puts a burden on projects. It is not uncommon for training to take 6 months to a year for a new post doc depending on the project.

+ Inept researchers slip through the cracks. You can commit gross safety violations and keep your job by having extensive political capital spent on you. Gross safety violations are not forgetting PPE or permanently using an extension cord. Gross safety violations are nearly killing a tech due to not following a strict procedure, and then having a career of disregarding any and all safety and guidance.

+Internal LDRD funding seems to go to the usual suspects. There is very little transpanancy about why projects are turned down.

+At 450-500 per staff member per year, overhead is excessive. This prevents hiring of new staff members. Why do projects pay division overhead and then still have hours billed to them by divisional management. Seems like double dipping a little.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.0

Part of this is no doubt due to the funding difficulties and ambiguous mission. But part of it is also due to the extremely poor management.

  Managers typically treat employees badly. They often tell THEIR managers what they want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. The company that theoretically runs the lab, UChicago, LLC is massively out of touch and has little contact with regular employees or the realities of the laboratory. HR, as in many large organizations, is evil. Women aren't treated well. When it comes to diversity, mentoring, career development, safety, and security, the laboratory is all talk, no commitment or action. The US Department of Energy (DOE) that owns the lab is overall one of the more inept government bureaucracies.

  Hard work, creativity, passion, initiative, and competence, while not unheard of at Argonne, will usually get you in trouble. The best advice I would offer is not to be completely incompetent, but also don't stand out as a star. Better to stall when given tasks, try to avoid getting on anybody's radar, and never volunteer for anything. Good and/or creative work should always be hidden from supervisors and managers so you don't become a target. This is often feasible because they usually aren't paying that much attention, don't care all that much, and because there are so many of them that they get in each other's way.

  It is hard to believe Argonne has much of a future, as it is mostly an arbitrary collection of sporadic R&D, middling user facilities, and government support services that could be done better, cheaper, and faster by the private sector. Plus, funding is problematic and will likely go down more in the future, and costs keep going up--mostly to support the expanding ranks of managers and bureaucrats with no discernible job functions.

-Daycare is available to employees (another caveat)","Argonne used to be a research institution. That has pretty much gone away except for a few fields, the lab is now entering a new era where it is managed and operated like a business (corporate management) as opposed to an educational setting. Lots of amenities that used to exist at Argonne (post office, on-site auto mechanic, gas station, pool, for examples) have gone away due to budget cuts (or perceived as too high a liability). Like many things that go through cycles of plenty and famine, Argonne is in a time of quasi-famine and is struggling through budget cuts (and sequestration?) despite working hard to obtain money from DOE because otherwise it is only obtaining money through projects (which are always under competition, and Argonne takes sizeable chunks of money as operating expenses, thus inhibiting the desire to research at Argonne).

Also during this transition, it has been noticed that anything that was pushed by management that was potentially controversial would be enshrouded in safety, a highly regarded virtue. While safety is important to everybody, this tactic enabled the position to deflect criticism as though it was a knock on safety. As a result, unless the argument was profoundly sound or the dissent was large enough, critics were rebuked as though they were welcoming unsafe working conditions.

Pay compared to private sector is not nearly as competitive. Daycare tuition is very expensive even though the quality is high. Management would change in various divisions every couple years, divisions would reorganize.","Here's an analogy: I'm driving a car and I'm directed to watch my speed. If I take my eyes off the road to look at my speedometer and a mishap occurs, I'm faulted for not watching where I'm going. If I keep my eyes on the road but my speed goes above the limit, I'm faulted for not watching my speed. I've seen many occasions where getting from point A to point B is the objective and there is more obsession for the way that one gets there. So what's more important? The ends or the means? Some say both, some say the means, some say the ends. I say, ""If the means are so important that we can't get to the end, the problem isn't the means or the ends. The problem is the perception.""

On-sight medical department that does annual health evaluations and gives free flu shots. Nice, modern on-site fitness facility. 10 paid holidays. The whole place shuts down between Christmas Eve and New Years Day, so everyone gets a nice winter break. If you are an inventor on a patent that gets licensed, you can get 30% of the royalties. Decent cafeteria food (prices are same as for comparable restaurant food; not free for any employee). Security guards at the site entrance. There is a branch of Abri Credit Union on-site. Flex time is allowed, at the discretion of an employee's supervisor. Sometimes flex-time is arranged formally, especially for the non-scientists; but it is more often done informally for the scientists. This makes work-life balance easier. You can bank up to 30 vacation days before you have to use them and you can bank up to 120 sick days. Staff members can also use sick leave for when family members are sick.","Virtually all funding come from the U.S. government in the form of many small grants--it is not one big pot of money (except for the APS which is 25% of Argonne's funding). This means that many staff scientists are expected to develop their own research program and apply for grants, much the way university professors do (only there is no tenure or guaranteed job as a reward). When Congress can't get their fiscal act together, which is almost always, it causes problems with funding. In addition, no funding is 100% guaranteed and the DOE can recall it, usually with no advance warning, anytime they please for any reason, even if they have promised not to. Every time there is a change or President or change of DOE secretary, research priorities change and funding is shifted to other technologies. Good scientists then get let go because each division is run independently money-wise. Lay-offs are common (90% of the workers are not federal employees, so there is no protection from this sort of thing). Post-docs have a 30% chance of getting a staff position. Safety is a more important to the DOE than science and Argonne management has a target of zero injuries, so don't you dare get stung by a bee or slip on the ice. There has been significant benefit erosion, especially with sick days and vacations days, but also with severance pay. I expect banking of vacation days and retirement plan benefits to be cut next.","Have realistic safety goals. Give the new employees a decent amount of vacation and sick days like you did prior to 2009. Help the staff scientists establish research programs and continue to get funding, don't rely on ""mentoring"" for that. Show that you recognize that all of the programs and technologies have value, not just the APS and the battery program.

It is a truly amazing place.",All government jobs that I have had come with a certain amount of baffling bureaucracy. Argonne has a certain amount of this although I had little contact with it. The most negative thing that I observed was people being removed from projects that were going well because they had become unpopular and funding was pulled. This can happen anywhere and the administration (and administrative staff) that I interacted with did their best to minimize this problem.,Continue protecting the creative independence of your staff.

Good work environment.,0,"Argonne's people are generally pleasant to work with, are diverse in their cultural backgrounds, and are typically very intelligent. It's very common to find yourself collaborating with people from all different fields of engineering, science, and technical disciplines. That said, it's commonly acceptable to switch departments or research groups every few years. As for strictness of daily schedule, most people people work their own hours and can get away anytime for appointments or the occasional forgotten lunch. Also, Argonne also puts a high value on worker safety and awareness, so you'll never find yourself doing something you're unsure about.

There are many clubs (gardening, professionalism, radio operators, etc) and sports (soccer, volleyball, frisbee, and a couple of unique ones) which typically meet during lunch hours. I very much enjoyed getting to know my coworkers, exercising on-site, and going for walks on-site through the forests. Argonne even has a free gym on-site which is open 24/7. Did I mention it's in the middle of a nature preserve? The buildings may be old as heck, but the place is beautiful.","Employees' salaries are highly dependent on government program funding - which fluctuates, freezes, and sometimes disappears unexpectedly, causing the death of many good projects. So your pay can be stuck in place for a few years at a time and this year's breakthrough project might not get funding next year. Benefits are pretty good, but private companies would probably offer better packages.

Many people have very reasonable bosses/managers, so it's really a toss-up. The best thing to do if you end up with a micro-manager or overbearing one is to stick it out until you find another interesting project to hire you. Spend some personal time getting to know other groups and developing friendly relationships. This type of boss is best managed by only working the hours you're paid for and no more.","Invest confidence in your employees' abilities and encourage them along the way. Constant micro-managing wastes your time and theirs. It drives them away and breeds disrespect for your leadership. Don't gloss over project completions, celebrate them.",4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0
