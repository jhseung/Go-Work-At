I keep hearing stories of people who are eating their first food ~8hrs after starting the day, and are planning to go back to work after their break as I am leaving for the day. They get paid less, they work longer hours, and they seem much less happy than the technology folks overall. That's why you see the huge gap between 1 and 5 star ratings on this site.

Unlimited vacation for salaried employees. More good managers than bad. Whether I would recommend to a friend depends on which manager they would be working for.","If you work for a manager who lacks social skills or is a bully, and you can't transfer, you are doomed to misery. HR will be sympathetic but won't really do anything. Your best defense is to make sure you interview other people who work for your prospective boss before you join.

The company conducted a survey and formed committees to decide what to do about various employee dissatisfaction problems, but management accountability was conspicuously absent from the committee recommendations because -- surprise, surprise -- management advisors blocked all attempts to address it.","The only thing that sometimes motivates a bully to change is threatening adverse consequences if he doesn't. You can't train your way out of management problems caused by ingrained personality traits. And you can't train managers who think they don't need training because they're too deficient in empathy to know how deficient in empathy they are.

Zymergen could take some advice from my current employer.

There has been a culture change where the company feels some disconnect between departments. The peer review process and promotions are very controversial.

2018-06-23,,"Emeryville, CA",Current Employee ,"Seen Zymergen grow, still excited for what's ahead!",More than 3 years,0,"I’ve seen Zymergen grow by several hundred employees in a few short years. No doubt there have been bumps along the way, and we’ll continue to have bumps as we continue to scale, but I am just as excited about our vision and potential for true impact now as I was when I first started.

Some aspects of the culture have remained from when Zymergen was smaller than 100 people, others have changed. For example, Zymergen still takes security for client data very seriously (necessary for the industries we work in), while promoting transparency internally. I feel like I am treated as a partner, and as an adult. At bi-weekly all hands meetings, executives speak candidly, and I get to see the same slides that the board sees, etc. As it was in the beginning, everyone is happy to take time to help when asked—we have tremendous access to experts across many fields, and it isn’t hard to get their ears (though as the company grows, I can see how folks who’ve more recently joined might not know firsthand that folks across the org are approachable). It’s definitely true that roles are more defined and specialized now, but that’s expected as a company matures. While I used to wear many hats, sometimes a different one each week when needed, the variety of my work has decreased. Nonetheless, I don’t feel boxed in, and when I see a problem, I feel that I am empowered to fix it, or influence that we need to figure out how to resource for it.

I think we’re coming out of a purely consensus driven culture, where everyone in the room has veto rights, into a reality where decisions cannot be made efficiently without a little process and division of ownership. Since we’ve grown so rapidly, our processes haven’t kept up, and it can feel a bit chaotic. It’s always felt like there’s too much to do and too little resources across all groups (I think this is just a commonality for all companies who’ve hit a market demand and are working to capture it… it’s a good problem to have), but with the added coordination burden, etc., it intensifies the problem. I don’t think this is unique to Zymergen, and it’s an expected bump. I see good momentum from execs and from bottom-up around the org to address difficulties in resource allocation and decision making, and we’re on the right track.

You might have noticed some negative review on here. The execs have noticed, we’ve discussed it at all hands meetings, and a culture survey was organized to try to get better data on where the company needs to improve. Some people are somewhat cynical about this, but knowing the leadership personally for several years, I am convinced they have their employees’ wellbeing as a top priority, and take this very seriously. I think the execs are doing a great job to try to give agency to individuals in the company to own and shape the culture in the direction we all want to go. Some see this as a lack of leadership—I see it as a sight of trust in us as employees.

I personally have a fantastic relationship with my manager and other leaders in my org. I’ve been able to identify opportunities within the company, have been able to evolve my role, and grow my skills within Zymergen. I am truly grateful for my time here—it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience for me to grow professionally and technically.

Last—the technology. This is what made me join the company in the first place. I’m personally pretty mission-driven, and the idea what we can bring metabolic engineering to bear on real human problems inspires me. The passion from the early employees drew me in, and I knew it was the right place for me. We’re bringing together high throughput lab automation with modern molecular biology and computation in a way that I believe it truly unique. And the combination of these three things—conceptualizing metabolic engineering as a search problem—has unlocked strain optimizations on timescales that I truly don’t think would be possible anywhere else.

It’s hard to build the platform to which we aspire, and we’re not done—but it’s been an exciting ride, and I can’t wait to see how much farther we get. There are so many challenging and awesome problems to work on that aren’t quite the same anywhere else. If you’re looking for a place that is at steady state that has figured out how to just turn the crank, Zymergen might not be for you. If instead you don’t mind a little chaos, want to join an org that is still developing its identity (though the high risk of an early-stage startup is gone), and help influence how to build the platform, it’s a great time to join.","(Don't really think pros/cons can be neatly separated with full context, so see my somewhat lengthy ""pros"" section.)",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2018-06-20,,,Current Employee ,"generally positive, definitely struggles",More than a year,0,"I've been at Zymergen a while. My first year here, it was hands down the best place I have ever worked, period. Since then - it's changed a bit. But there's still a lot of good. This is a complicated, interesting set of problems for a company to try to solve, and most people are basically interested in solving the problem. There is respect for different positions / points of view (though sometimes you have to stop and ask for it), even if it's inconvenient . Also, this is a place where if you have the confidence to try something new, you can, and if you make mistakes, it's OK, you can do better next time. I also think the kind of people attracted to this industry / work environment / location are fun to be around. I'm a moderately quirky introvert, and these are my people.","CEO talks about ""next play culture"" and I think it's true - as a group we seem obsessed with what's wrong, but when you look back you realize how much we've gotten done, and how many deadlines we've hit. I feel like this balance used to be good, but it's shifted and is now contributing to an over-anxious atmosphere.

As it's grown, the processes are both not keeping up, and more than we are used to, and work expectations haven't adjusted. We're still trying to do the amount of work that's possible for each person at a 100 person company, when we need to coordinate with 500. Also it feels like there are too few people in most teams...

I'm also sad that there are people whose overall experience is so different from mine - the Glassdoor reviews and company-wide survey results make the range of experiences obvious. I'm sure it's real, but I'm thankful the leadership seems honestly invested in trying to do something about it, rather than trying to fix the cosmetic problem (no one has ever asked us to write reviews, which has happened to me at previous companies with Glassdoor problems).","I think the saying is ""your eyes are bigger than your stomach"". Moderate your aspirations (or at least, what you tell the employees), and set clear expectations, so that everyone doesn't freak out.

The oft-expressed ""assumption of goodwill"" philosophy doesn't work when people behave like bullies and in a manipulative manner. As an employee, I've seen this behavior not only between departments, but within a department as well.

When I was hired, it was advertised that some more the more menial lab work will be completed by other departments. However, now that I've seen how the lab work is completed, I'm NOT okay with how Zymergen is advertising this. Let's be real-- some people do not treat ""service"" personnel well. That's true in restaurants and at work. Having major departments that are critical to the function of the company--media, qc, and lab ops-- branded as ""services"" marginalizes the importance of their roles and creates a hierarchy within Zymergen that is dangerous to the culture of this place. These guys have masters and BS degrees and are washing our dishes and at our beck and call. If anyone's experiment goes wrong, they get blamed for bad media or bad glassware and get complaints on a near daily basis, many of it unfounded.Also, they were the only ones working during the offsite last year. How is it fair to have one group of people serving drinks to another group at an offsite where everybody is meant to bond as equals? How did management think this was a good idea?

""Do whatever you can at whatever cost"" attitude

Bloated middle-management is causing a slowdown in work pace. Management is untrained in actually... you know... managing. They are focused are delivering results, despite not knowing HOW to deliver results.

I was hired as a senior associate but am doing entry-level work. I can't contribute to bigger projects because there is nobody else to actually execute on the things that HAVE to get done.

The people that were hired a year or more ago have a revered position/opinions merely because they've actually managed to survive here. This attitude is detrimental to the company, though. Maybe the veterans were good at there job when we were smaller, but they don't know how to scale, manage, or keep their egos in check.

Honestly, I want to love it here, but the egos and middle management make it impossible to work here. This place is hemorrhaging good talent.",,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

2018-01-13,,"Emeryville, CA",Current Employee ,Great people and exciting work,Less than a year,0,"What interested me in Zymergen (beyond the vision) was the company's culture. I had worked with them as a vendor and was always excited when an opportunity to work with them came up (they were always engaged customers, taking notes and asking questions). Now that I work there, it's better than expected.

People are collaborative, they trust each other, they respect each other's time and effort, they're honest about what they don't know or what they need help with. People make mistakes and disagree but we've always been able to bounce back and not let that negatively impact the work we're doing or the relationships. Thus far, I've seen few exceptions to this.

The hours and workload are relatively flexible - there may be cases where grinding work through is necessary but that's not a standard day in any of the departments I've worked with. When that's happening people are vocal about it and work to find ways to make the workload sustainable.","- Catered food is only Mon, Wed, Fri (happy hour), the kitchen is stocked though
- Not a lot of structure from the organization, though that's currently being built, so onboarding, training, etc.. are department led. You'll have to figure some things out on your own.
- Departments are relatively flat so there isn't much hierarchy (I prefer this), but it makes ""career advancement"" a little difficult to navigate",,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

CEO seems to genuinely care about the company and it's employee's","There is a lot of ego. (despite what my recruiter said)

It's difficult to get your point across sometimes as people like to talk rather than listen.

I feel bullied by my colleagues often; it makes it difficult to stay motivated or to want to work with the team.

I feel ""there is room for growth within the company"" is untrue. All the well qualified coworkers that have applied for higher positions have been turned down in favor of outside candidates.

Many of my coworkers feel we're treated like servants by a majority scientists.

During my interview process, my recruiter told me unlimited PTO was one of the perks but this was taken away shortly after I started.

Do as a say, not as a do mentality.",I tried to tell my manager about the ego/bullying problem but was told to 'assume goodwill'.

2017-10-22,,,Current Employee ,Low morale,,0,Good company vision. Exciting technology and future.,"I feel like a hamster in a wheel.

I don’t have the basic tools to do my job.

I don’t have a voice in the company.

I’m just an employee who wants to my job correctly and support the company succeed and innovate.

- I can’t do that when I don’t have rudimentary tools to execute in my job function.

- I can’t do that when departments don’t communicate with each other and don’t trust each other.

Management is too busy covering for themselves instead of representing, growing, and nurturing direct reports. They don’t listen when request for equipment and don’t want to cause any waves.","Departments need to get on the same page.

Company needs to figure out its values. Focusing on vision and mission is great, but by looking ahead, you’re missing the dumpster fire that’s starting in front of you.

Growth opportunities are limited and what growth there is, isn’t defined, written anywhere, or established. What do I need to do to get promoted? Nothing is defined and as a result, some departments whose managers care can grow and find satisfaction while other departments see turnover and remain stunted. Harmonize these practices. Salary ranges for grade-levels aren’t posted anywhere so there is no transparency on how you’re paid.

Supervisors and managers need people training and management training and need to be better evaluated.

as far as the other negative review on here: anyone with eyes and ears can see some departments aren’t treated well. The complaints aren’t startup growing pains. I’ve worked in startups. These are management and priority pains. Figure out if you want to maintain non R&D departments and finance them and give them a voice, or outsource and contract those departments and cut the cord. Keeping these departments but treating them like garbage is the worst of both worlds. And what was HR thinking with their move to eliminate Benefits for a select group? Giving them some employees benefits then stripping them away selectively is poor practice. If you take away unlimited PTO from some people, take it away from ALL people, or better yet, eat the cost of your mess up. It was a gross mistake on HRs part and the lowest paid, lowest valued employees suffer for it.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

I imagine it'd be an exciting place to work if you're in the department with resources and not in the department that's spit on.,"Sure, the company's new, but old enough to already sow the seeds of a toxic environment. Forget about having the basics to perform your job, or even basic respect, if you aren't in research.

The attitude that if a Scientist asks you to jump off the bridge, your response must be, ""golden gate or bay bridge?"" comes from the executive level, so I don't see this culture changing.

REF has had half a dozen reported injuries and probably another 6 that haven't been reported, because nothing comes from them. Nobody cares. No changes have been made. A stupid safety powerpoint at all hands doesn't cut it as a response to all of our injuries.

ALL software is designed for scientists. Any software implemented in Lab Ops only makes our jobs harder/ more complicated/ adds redundancies. We've asked for software support and have basically been laughed at.

I hear others have been hired to do a job function, but aren't given the tools they need to do their jobs.

Let's not mention that an RA I has the SAME BACKGROUND/ JOB REQUIREMENTS as a Tech I (bio degree, lab experience), but one is exempt with unlimited vacation while the other is not with a WAAAY lower salary.

We aren't learning anything in our positions and have no room grow.","Treat all employees with respect.

Scientists and RAs treat us like garbage, upper management has unrealistic expectations from us. We get zero resources to do our jobs.

We've had injuries on the job that aren't taken seriously.

Middle management has no real experience and does nothing but bow obsequiously to scientists and executives, to the detriment of their direct reports. People that try to fight for us are canned or quit.

Nobody cares about us.

If you have the guts and care about changing the culture, give a REF survey to hear how people feel. You probably won't like what you hear.

Or let the toxic culture continue to ferment.",1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0
