Often it is through a post-graduation internship program, which is a mixed bag due to the fact that it's kind of a leap of faith for the employee.

- Excellent work/life balance in most teams, although some people really lean toward the life part which might explain a portion of Dolby's sluggish growth.
- Incredibly intelligent colleagues with deep industry knowledge and critical thinking skills.
- Many interesting and amazing products on the horizon. Being a part of those developments that could be truly game-changing is amazing if we can get them launched and launched well.
- The promise and potential of working for a great brand.
- Unique perk: employee screenings of first run movies in the best theater (acoustically) in the country.","- Out-dated culture, heavy on old-school style political maneuvering to the degree that ideas and innovation are generally stifled. If you do happen to bring something solid to the table that a more Machiavellian colleague notices, he will take it for his own and give you little to no credit and probably not fully flesh out.
- Lack of mentoring - While you might be surrounded by great minds, you will only get to learn by osmosis even if you ask for mentoring. If you are not already at the top of your game upon hiring, you will be side-lined. There is little opportunity to learn and grow your career, despite any promise you might hold. This cultural aspect also fails to create managers who jump on teachable moments as opportunities to develop their staff and expand on ideas.
- These same brilliant minds while ""waxing poetic"" in highly-intelligent and fascinating discourse and debates of critical thinking and industry expertise often get so bogged down by the political strategies of consensus based decision making that progress is slow (which in tech, spells eventual death). There are few meetings less than 90 minutes and that is often weekly.
- Initiative is not only not encouraged or rarely rewarded, but is sometimes actively disapproved of. Honestly, it sometimes seems like one's proclivity for initiative is perceived as ""making another look bad"" rather than doing what needs to be done for the good of the project. Rolling up your sleeves and digging in as a team is not part of the culture here.
- Multiply all of the above x10 if you are a woman and then some.

I love the passion I hear and truly believe everyone is entitled to their opinion and to report on their experience. I simply and transparently want to lend my voice to the mix.

By way of background and context, I have been in my role at Dolby since the beginning of 2014 after two decades working for Nike, Nokia, Apple and most recently as an early stage VC. So what drew me to Dolby?

- Amazing technology and products in development
- Passionate people who believe in the company’s purpose and mission
- Exceptional brand and history of innovation
- A love of music and entertainment
- The opportunity to help set the course for the next 50 years of this iconic company

In the last nine months I have seen all of these attributes in action and believe as strongly in them as I did the day I joined. I have also observed a company and a marketing organization in transition. What few realize is the company over the last few years has quietly transformed itself from an enterprise reliant on the sale of DVD players to one that is a vital part of today's entertainment ecosystem and has brought whole new platforms such as Dolby Atmos, Dolby Voice and Dolby Vision to market. I give the management team huge credit navigating this change – I certainly had nothing to do with it!

On the marketing front, the transformation has been equally significant as a fragmented organization is beginning to be knit together into a more coordinated team. We are in the middle of this process and have a ways to go. Needless to say this is the most important work I do.

To anyone (current employee, past employee, interviewee) with questions, complaints or comments about the marketing org or the leadership team at Dolby I encourage you to reach out. Those who know me know that my door is always open and I can handle feedback. Please take me up on it!","Progress and change never happen as quickly as we want. Nor are they perfectly predictable. This work requires patience and in addition to patience, it takes a strong will, the ability to get into the mix, and to collaborate and occasionally even compromise.",We as a team need to keep listening and communicating.

While here, I've had tremendous growth opportunities: I've learned a ton from a variety of challenging projects across all areas of my field, and I've been able to advance my career. I really appreciate:
- Working on a daily basis with highly intelligent, analytical, interesting people both within and outside my function. Respecting and learning from the people around me is super important to me. The interesting thing about Dolby is that many of these people tend to be humble as well.
- The availability of challenging, worthwhile ""problems"" to solve - you can really make an impact here; the level of complexity can be frustrating at times, but for the most part guarantees you won't be bored or complacent
- The leadership team's commitment to high quality and high integrity - we make high quality products, we take pride in solving difficult problems, and while I may not agree with every leadership decision I have never questioned whether leaders would ""do the right thing""
- In general, I think many people enjoy good work-life balance here and the off-Fridays are a great benefit","Many of our challenges are not unique to Dolby and include:
Being a truly ""global"" company in which our non-US HQ regions are set up for success
A leadership style and culture that is more ""traditional"" and ""hierarchical"" than many tech companies, although I see some evidence this is changing

Dolby is a company in decline. Core technology patents are expiring, and new technologies are not being effectively brought to market.

2013-10-18,,,Current Employee ,Sad About this Company....,Sad About this Company....,0,A full time job with benefits and salary in the city of San Francisco.,"When I first started working at Dolby, I was really proud to tell people that I worked here. The bulk of my discussions and interactions with my colleagues were positive ones.
Today, on the other hand, I’m somewhat ashamed of our company and the way that we're acting toward one and another - along with the way that we behave within the larger community.

Our Impact on SF:

Look for instance at the three blocks that we cover in San Francisco. The hill up to our Potrero parking lot is covered with garbage, shopping carts and homeless encampments. And as far as I can tell, we’ve done nothing to alleviate the suffering for the homeless in this area much less clear the garbage or even put in a security system for our employees trying to get to their cars after dark.

Walking in the other direction to our building at Brannan, one has to walk through shopping carts, garbage and worse. I know plenty of businesses all over San Francisco who take responsibility for the entire area around their business but we just don’t bother – so our workers and their visitors have to walk through this over and over. And we do nothing to improve the neighborhood for other San Franciscans.

Now, we have purchased a building on Market Street – what are we planning to do to truly benefit that area when we can’t be bothered to clean up the trash within fifty yards of our current properties?

Employee Well Being:

At this point in time, my colleagues and a multitude of workers are simply overworked. I watch as the number of acceptable working hours raises month after month – and as my co-workers become used to 10 and 12 work days. There is no sense that what we do is a “marathon” or that people’s lives outside of work truly matter. Co-workers snap at one another, and the number of times that I’ve heard the words “thank you” has diminished extraordinarily in the last 6 months especially.

Tearing Down our Workforce:

I haven’t experienced as much one-upsmanship since my Greek days at university. Someone is “all good” because they do one big deal – but they’re forgotten or even unceremoniously fired as soon as the next person comes in. I’ve watched wonderful employees be stamped upon as the next person and next ideas walk in the door.

We have the typical gossip – it’s human nature to dwell on the random extramarital affair or drunken gaff at a work function. But the majority of the gossip is about someone’s perceived incompetence – executives (young to be sure) harpooned for being awkward public speakers; outright criticism of a current or former employee in large meetings; one person throwing another under the bus in order to protect themselves during what feels like a really tenuous time (following up on perhaps the 4th or 4 re-orgs in so many years).

In this most recent round, many employees have been laid off or fired as we bring in “fresh” senior executives and consultants. Does this happen in a lot of companies? Of course. But I cannot imagine why we at Dolby are behaving this way. And I also can’t imagine that Ray Dolby or his son would be pleased to fully understand what we’re doing to people’s lives here.","Tell your employees thank you and coach them to say it to one another.

- Die Kommunikationskultur ist eher diffus, d.h. eher keine klaren Aussagen, viele Relativierungen und Meta-Diskussionen, man redet scheinbar eher aus Freude an der Diskussion (und erfreut sich deren Doppelbödigkeit und künstlich geschaffenen Komplexität) als tatsächlich an Lösungen zu arbeiten (welche ja am ehesten zu erreichen sind durch Reduktion der Komplexität und klare Kommunkation). Keine lösungsorientierte Diskussionskultur. Wer gerne und viel redet um des Redens willen ist hier richtig, wer schnell Ergebnisse schaffen will wird frustriert sein.

Viele Mitarbeiter sitzen mit ihren Rechnern in den Meetings und arbeiten währenddessen, was bei manchen Meetings (mit Laptop-Quote > 80%) ein für Aussenstehende bizarres Bild ergibt. Der Großteil der Teilnehmer kommt spät zum Meeting (wegen vorhergehender Meetings) und die Meetings werden dazu noch oft überzogen.
