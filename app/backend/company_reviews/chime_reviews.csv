Great people
Wonderful management
Awesome office manager
Good food","There are virtually no downsides to working at Chime. One cautionary note for engineers is that there's only mild support for external, continuing education. On the bright side, given that we are growing at 150,000+ users per month, there is plenty of internal work to feed your intellectual curiosity. You can see I am stretching to come up with a Con. This is a great place; if you have the opportunity to join us, you absolutely should.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-01-16, Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Good people, but culture is changing",More than a year,0,"Still good people there, positive outlook on the company, nice new offices.","Work / life balancing is being eroded. Too much chatter on ""going fast"" vs. using a methodical approach to delivering new user experiences that are well thought out and clearly defined, and are of high value and quality. This is not always the case. Communication between teams is near non existent. The ""left hand"" does not know what the ""right hand"" is doing.","Become better leaders. Stop endless pressure to get software out the door, stop breaking stuff all the time....",2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0
2018-08-31,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Amazing culture, mission, and execution on this rocket ship",Less than a year,0,"I'm honestly a little shocked at how well-run this company is! Many companies talk about having a transparent culture, but this is the first company I've worked at that lives and breathes it: cofounders and exec team are readily available and don't shy away from talking about tough issues, there are frequent all-hands updates on company financials and performance, and the whole company is kept abreast of things like confidential upcoming partnerships. It feels amazing to work for a company that is honestly helping average Americans and where the employees are eagerly pushing for more customer-friendly initiatives.

I believe Chime is a true rocketship, and I'm impressed that it is doing so well without having everyone internally running around like their pants are on fire. I think it's one of those companies that will have a crazy financial success while still many people in the SF tech scene won't know of it - the team here has their head down doing good work. People work hard and are deliberate about getting things done in a data-driven way, but there isn't unproductive stress.

Also, everyone is SO friendly!",None! Except the office does not have phenomenal climate control and can get kinda hot.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-07-25,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Customers and Employees first + Great Mission and Culture,More than a year,0,"Leadership is fantastic - experienced, transparent, engaging, etc.
Interactions are great - manners and respectful behavior seem to be missing in so many places, but not here. You feel appreciated and that people really have your back here.
Total autonomy for the most part - trust is high here and, of course, combined with what's best for Chime.
Chime's progress, successful and not so successful updates alike are plentiful and regular without any spin. If there's any agenda, it's to address issues and work towards a solution if that's the case.
I feel pumped to come in every day for myself, my team, and our customers, and I believe all of us are honored to be able to help our customers out anyway we can.

Bulletpoints because we all love them:
Low ego + high standards
Collaborative, transparent process
Great life/work balance (managing results, not activity)
Support from top-to-bottom for any and all
Great manager and IC training for job and company skills
Competitive compensation with benefits and a wide range of perks - especially team-building (but during regular hours for the most part, so respecting people's personal time)","Nothing for me - if anything, just the growing pains of explosive growth. Even then, they're really on it. Hiring, training, events, resources, etc.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-07-26,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Great mission, great culture",More than a year,0,"- Mission-driven. Feels good to go up against the big banks and help everyday Americans.
- The (already great) company culture has only improved over time, even with the company tripling in size over the last year. Feels very positive, collaborative, transparent.
- Not much turnover. People like it here and tend to stay.
- Great health benefits and flexible PTO. I have a chronic illness and I've never had any issues getting time off to take care of my health.
- Love the exec team. They're friendly, approachable, and great at what they do. Actually, this can be said for everyone at Chime.
- Office dogs. ++++++","- The company is still going through some growing pains, but I can see this subsiding as teams are built out and processes are established.
- Not a dealbreaker, but it would be nice to have access to FSA/HSA benefits. 401(k) matching would be great, too.
- I took on a new role within the company, and it took 6 months to adjust my salary. Didn't feel great, especially as a female POC. It did get resolved eventually, just not as quickly as I would have hoped.","- Don't lose touch with our members. Keep being present with employees.
- Find ways to increase communication and collaboration across departments.
- Keep up the great work!",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0
