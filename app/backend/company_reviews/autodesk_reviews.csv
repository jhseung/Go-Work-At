My manager is fantastic and my teammates are the best, which makes coming to work a pleasure (and how many times can you say that?). We’re able to telecommute when it makes sense, but I’d rather be in the office because my teammates always enhance the work I’m doing.

The culture is awesome here! I feel engaged and happy in my job, and in my work environment. Even though this is technically a large corporation, it still has a family feel within my division and department. You can tell that managers are thoroughly trained in leadership and communication skills.

You can really tell the company cares about the happiness and well-being of its employees with its reach of employee programs and events, as well as commitment to work-life balance. I especially enjoy Autodesk's array of employee programs spanning from company soccer and softball tournaments, gyms, to on-site dog-walking.

My last year at Autodesk my most current boss told me I’d be promoted by the end of the year, instead I was laid off during, yet another, company reorganization.

Autodesk is a velvet coffin. Get comfortable in your role because you’re not going anywhere within the company, you’ll like it there so you won’t really try to leave. Your skills will become stale if you’re not developing them outside of Autodesk because this is not a company you can grow with.

Oh, by the way, as mentioned by many - Work Life Balance is a big deal at Autodesk. It does not mean that you will not work long hours from time to time. But, when you do, you do not even realize it because you enjoy what you do but also, they make you take a break and they genuinely care that you prioritize your family before work. At least that was my experience.","It is a big company that is still transforming into its new business model and adjusting to what the market demands. There seems to be a lot of positioning to what is ""Hot"" and in the process, an opportunity to grow can become challenging. It seems that it ends up promoting unintended competition to be recognized and hopefully, an opportunity for moving up the ladder.

The Grade level system means well, but, it seems that moving up internally is more challenging than someone being hired from outside. Someone who have been in the company a bit longer, knows the process, know the people, products, etc. can be in the same grade and pay level as a new hire. Similarly, if there is an opportunity for an internal job opening where you can meet about 80% of the requirements, but you are two grade levels below the req., you cannot apply for that role. Someone outside with unproven track record and maybe meet 90% of the requirements on paper - has a better chance of getting it.

I have been in the company for 6 years and I have experienced re-structuring about 4 times. Some are company-wide and some on the organization level within. This is not uncommon for the industry that is changing rapidly. Do not get discouraged by this comment, it only means that you need always strive to learn something new and be prepared for change and find an opportunity when change happens.","Prioritize the growth and hiring of internal people first who have proven their value to the company.

Continue on the direction we are heading !",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

STRONG work/life balance","The new leadership team is new - haven't had time to eradicate the negatives from the ""old Autodesk.""","- Pay attention to your middle management. There are some rockstar managers who treat their employees well and have their loyalty. Find out what their secret sauce is and then teach some of the ""technical"" managers how to use it. There are some managers who have only been promoted to their role because they had no other career options. Find out if they really have the people skills to be in management. Some of them do and some of them don't. Hire more rockstar managers.

- Don't be so SF-centric. The company has tried to not be so entrenched in the Bay but it's telling that the bulk of the leadership team lives there. Lead by example. Promote people in other offices to Sr. Leadership positions so they can develop excellence and teams in those locations.

- Spend more time in town halls and beer bashes instead of streamed all hands. You've got the opportunity to add your personalities to your positions. The ROI is high. Employees already respect and trust you. They just want to get to know you better. Not everything has to go back to business goals.

- I've ""grown up"" at Autodesk and have loved seeing the evolution of the company. Keep growing and evolving. I'm a millennial and I'm proud to tell people who I work for and that I have no plans to jump ship any time soon. The leadership team is inspiring and the people here are amazing.

Most of the people I worked with had no experience building SaaS software (or any online services), a stubborn inability to think of users first, and they often struggled with the methodologies of agile software production. I worked with a lot of incompetent people at Autodesk who couldn't move past their old ways of making boxed software that they only had to update once per year.

Autodesk's investments in facilities to showcase the breadth of innovation and solution capability (the Gallery at 1 Market, Pier 9, the Build Space, etc.)

Find the right team and manager, you will thrive. Alternative can be quite the opposite experience.","Lack of strong, respected executive level leaders and mentors:

  - Executive leadership team is largely inaccessible other than Town Hall sessions.
  - Executive leadership team is saturated with experience in Autodesk's historic business model and void of experience in Autodesk's new business models (SAAS, cloud, customer success, etc.).
  - Executive leadership team is out of touch with customers and their expectations as well as the internal Autodesk workforce.
  - Executive Sales leaders are ego driven, arrogant and have limited to no self-awareness of their roots. They routinely take input from a limited few in their inner circles and rarely demonstrate trust across their extended leadership teams.

Annual restructuring events:

- Annual restructuring events are highly distracting, morale killers and lack the needed transparency from the executive leadership levels. Messaging is perceived as disingenuous.
  - Middle management is left to deliver the difficult message to the masses without real clarity or proper pre-planning.
  - Poor timing prior to the holidays and in the midst of closing year end business.

Opportunities to advance:

  - Advancement opportunities have the perception they are hand-picked for a chosen few and often filled before positions are opened.
  - Very limited opportunity to pursue adjacent roles unless you're located in San Francisco or a major office. If located elsewhere, no relocation assistance is offered.
  - Unless you're in San Francisco, Boston or one of the Hubs (Denver, Barcelona, etc.) you're extremely limited if not excluded altogether from any growth or consideration.
  - Little time is invested in developing and evolving a culture to coach, develop and build talent. There are development programs, but again, only available for a select chosen few. That selection process is mysterious and lacks the necessary transparency to gain the buy-in programs like these need to succeed.","Minimize the annual distracting restructuring and demonstrate awareness of the tremendous impact on business, people & morale, especially with their timing around the holidays. These events are extremely detrimental to morale and employee's engagement.

Set a clear vision, build the business plans deep in strategy, accountability and execution to deliver the outcomes necessary to achieve our stated corporate goals. The compass heading cannot dramatically change every year or people cannot see the destination.

Take a hard look at some of the executive leadership in place (e.g. Sales) and assess their ability to develop and motivate world class organizations.

A core of true believers still remains, people who care about customers, products and each other.","The true believers are being swallowed up by a crowd of opportunists who are focused only on seeking political favor from senior leadership. Many of these opportunists barely know who their customers are and what they want.

A few years ago, Autodesk decided that it couldn't grow and compete by acquiring technology (it long ago gave up trying to innovate organically). Its new strategy, which has been increasingly visible over the past four years, has been to extract more money from customers who can't switch away easily from its products and to reduce costs by systematically cutting ""experienced"" employees, regardless of performance, and replacing them with interns and new hires. Of course, every company needs to turn over its skill base to stay relevant, but at Autodesk there is a pattern where low performing, highly paid but politically savvy employees are retained while higher performers are let go. What's worse, some of the new hires aren't always top performers (to be fair, some are excellent, but why settle for just some).

The environment has become increasingly political, and a company that has always struggled to listen to customers has become practically deaf to them at this point.

Oh, and the sabbatical seems like a cool idea, but when you compare it against a standard vacation policy it's not such a great deal.","You're not Adobe, and don't have the monopoly power you think you do.

- Lot of awesome initiatives happening with biotech & research
- Lot of work life balance
- Lot of opportunities for volunteer work and extracirricular activities!
- Super convenient location by BART
- Lot of general facility perks, such as onsite gym and access to Pier 9 - I've lasercut a lot of stuff for side projects :)
- Highly encourages making and you have access to the software for free
- Company is pretty much the leader in a lot of the software we offer, so there's bragging rights :)
- Lots of very smart, diverse, incredible people here! It's been incredibly humbling to work here.","This company is an old, old ship. A lot of the folks here have been here forever (10+ years) and are rooted in dated processes, unwilling to take feedback from new employees, until the new employees either quit or stay long enough to get absorbed in all those dated processes. As a younger employee, this can be intimidating - an older employee, who I introduced myself to in the kitchen one day, offhandedly told me that I probably wouldn't make it to the 4-year mark, as ""millenials are noncommittal"".

As a designer, the work depends (understandably) on what team you're on- but being a part of a big company, you will be siloed, and a lot of the work won't be sexy visually. There's currently been a movement towards creating global UI guidelines but it's taken a very, very long time to develop and the team that is working on it hasn't permeated all of the design teams yet, it feels that any one team within the company doesn't have much reach across orgs.

Generally not a huge design culture here - we host a lot of design events for the public, but internally, design thinking is still relatively new to non-designers and pushing that has been a challenge. The designers feel very disconnected, and there's often duplicate efforts happening and not a lot of communication. There have been efforts to bring us together; we have designer all-hands, but it feels that the original gusto has worn off. The company is very numbers and sales driven, and at times so ambitiously so that it costs our reputation with our customers; often I've felt the way we sell and bundle our products undermines our customer experience.

Some teams do not value or put as much budget into research, or sometimes that research will be introduced too late in the pipeline for any significant design changes to be made before getting rushed into development.

The people here are very transactional and often look for their own interests. When I was interviewing here, I emailed a designer on another team to ask about her interview process and her take on the culture- only to get back a reply that I should ""consider what I could offer her in return"" for her giving this information and that I should ""think about what I'm asking for before emailing her"" and that she was ""tired of getting emails asking for favors without any returns"". That should have been a red flag as this was very indicative of the silo culture here- asking for any help from any team that isn't yours will warrant a cold response, if any at all- and often to get any help you need to pull favors. Perhaps it's just the size of the company itself, but to me it's never felt very collaborative.

The company is very frugal and when I was in the offer stage, my particular recruiter was very, very pushy about asking for my old salary and as a result, my offered salary was much lower than that of peers in my same role and level, even after negotiating up another 5k. I have some suspicions that there is a fairly large pay gap between women and POC because of the way they recruit.

Also, your experience will vary widely depending on which department you are in. If you aren't in the department working on all of the software products, you don't get the same perks: we don't get any catered food, we don't have a winter holiday party, and we generally don't get invited to the celebrations the product departments host.","Listen to your customers. There's been overwhelming bad feedback about the latest sales model. Make a stronger effort to unite designers within orgs. Train recruiters on better recruiting strategies and better ways to equalize the pay across company; focus on diversifying candidate pool; instill a better culture of communication by introducing tools and methods for communicating; incentivize cross-company collaboration, so that employees feel loyalty not to just their teams but to the company as a whole; create a safer space for employees to feel comfortable calling out discrimination and improvements in processes.

Autodesk is doing some very cool things in various industries and I believe they're moving in the right direction as a whole. The benefits are second-to-none and I think the compensation was very reasonable.,"The SDR role should be for a college graduate or someone with 1-2 years of experience. ADSK is unfortunately apprehensive to hire young people (without a referral) as it is a bit of an 'older' company/workforce. Therefore, they bring in people that have too much experience doing a call-center type job and get bored quickly.

There is no upward mobility, pay raises, or varying responsibilities in the SDR role. They are limited by pay grade to actually move you anywhere so they give you the 'lateral movement' and 'create your own opportunities' speech. The problem with the lateral movement is that no one wants to put in 1.5-2 years as an SDR then move onto another product-line and be an SDR again. Also, they have made a culture of hiring from the outside so it's difficult to make a lateral movement anyway or create your own opportunity. During the hiring process, HR and a manager will say you can move into sales ops or marketing, etc. That is just not the case (until they bring those teams locally which is still never clear if they will).

Low-level and mid-level managers were very weak. They, for one, have no time with their teams because they sit in meetings all day. So the aspect of coaching, mentoring, etc was hardly ever present. They also do not have the authority to make quick decisions which hampered the teams.

Their was hardly help with career development like working on other projects, etc. Some people were able to do this, but for the most part your job is to just 'call' day-in and day-out. Also, as of right now, management expects the SDR to be a burnout role due to the huge gap required in pay and experience to move elsewhere in the company. They do not say that publicly, but no one seemed surprised when we had ~10 SDR's leave in under 2 months due to the fact that you can't move into an account executive role like typical SDR organizations offer.",Understand how SDR organizations should work.

The pay is not low but not high either.
The company is not customer facing. And its products have sticky fact -- once the designers start using it, switching to another one is risky and costly. So it is sort of stable.
It is still dominating building industry and 2D CAD area. I tried a few other 2D softwares. They are far worse than AutoCAD.","The reason why I give it one star is because of three reasons (without them the company deserves 3 stars):
1. when I leave the company recently, there is no exist interview. My manager asked HR but no response. The company doesn't care why you want to leave.
2. I worked long enough time that I earn a sabbatical, which is 6 weeks paid vacation. I did not get payment for this when I left the company. So I sent email to HR asking for this. I did not get any response either.
3. Early this year I had a friend who wanted to partner with Autodesk. So I sent an email to a senior sales manager asking how to do so. I did not get response.

Apparently people working there just want to get paid. They are not passionate. This is the reason why I wanted to leave too. Only a few percentages of people really working hard -- I know a few of them. The rest are just lying in their chairs, sometimes making negative contributions. The company doesn’t pay excellent people enough – a few thousand dollar difference won’t encourage people to work harder and overtime. If you are smart and want to get paid for your contribution, don’t go there.

Not much growth. It is not one of the top three companies in 3D manufacturing industry. Since going from 2D to 3D is inevitable, it is losing its foundation. When their old customers (designers) retire, the company will suffer.

Pay is okay -- can't compete with the hot companies in bay area. Even startups can beat it. If you just want a job, this is a good company to work with.","AutoCAD is not easy to use.

This will be even more critical as the licensing model transitions from perpetual to subscription. Customers will be displaying their satisfaction based on their willingness to renew a subscription on software that they have made no upfront investment. Unlike the maintenance subscription model on perpetual licensing, where there is much more financial benefits to keeping current on maintenance to preserve their upfront investment.",4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
2016-03-01,,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Lots of layers,More than a year,0,"I learned a lot at my short time at Autodesk. Some lessons were wonderful and I'll keep with me; other lessons are ones I hope I don't experience again. Good news...the wonderful ones are more than the not-so-wonderful. Overall, I'd give management a B. Some deserve an A and others deserve much worse but overall a pretty human organization with a strong base product. Try to get in with an A or a B. Anything less and your life there will not be fun nor productive.","For me, the organization and the structure did not fit my personality. There were too many layers of management. During my time, the company was transitioning to a subscription based system and this seemed to make a lot of people nervous. Budgets were cut several times and several lay-offs occurred during my short time there. I put this under cons because management could have handled this differently and not have the stress that it put on many people restricting their creativity. Change is good and must be handled properly.","Consider the layers in the organization. Stress and other negative emotions snowball as it passes each layer.

Vision from executive management can be too broad, and how it applies to the different business units is not clearly defined. This leads to a lot of ambiguity and confusion.","The vision of the company and direction can be nebulous some times. Nobody knows what success looks like. The company is in a phase of transformation, so granted a lot of the future is unknown, but showcasing some small wins with competitors and other businesses and how they can apply to Autodesk would empower employees to replicate or inspire from these examples.",3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

2016-02-10, Senior Quality Assurance Analyst,"Boston, MA",Former Employee ,Overall a great company to work for,More than 5 years,0,"Autodesk is a powerhouse and is doing a lot of pioneering work in the digital design space, not only in Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) but in manufacturing, simulation, and even the media and entertainment space. It's pretty cool to work for the original PC solution for CAD!
-Benefits are top-notch
-Very interesting problems to work on in the AEC/geometry/cloud/manufacturing/simulation space
-Strong marketing and sales organization leading the charge
-Great people tend to work here and you will be interacting with some top minds in the industry.
-Lots of mobility for motivated individuals
-Great office environments

Overall, If I had the chance to work here again, I would definitely take it.","This is a publicly traded company and brings along with it all the politics headaches and periodic ""Reductions in Force"" that accompany any big public company. There's not much point in complaining about it. It's all the same thing that brings all the great benefits and opportunities to work on cool problems.
-You will find that innovation, while valued, is painful and slow however, if you stick with it, there are definitely opportunities to innovate.
-You should be ok with not necessarily having your opinion valued on the larger picture items. There is a corporate direction and that comes from the top, not the bottom in this company. If you can be happy with that and are excited to tackle whatever challenge comes you will be very happy at this company, If you have vision and want to try and make change outside of your group, you will likely be disappointed.
-I think you'll find Autodesk to be much like any large company. If you really want to be able to influence change in an organization, look for a small startup. I can't stress this enough: You will be successful here if you are happy doing your job as part of the big machine and not necessarily being able to see out to where you are going. (regardless of what the ""come work here"" marketing hype suggests).
-That said, note that there is a lot of internal opportunity for motivated individuals. I've seen developers move to UI, QA people move to sales, developers move to product management, there is a LOT of opportunity here.","I'd love to see management be better at helping people manage their career trajectories. Some are great, some others not so much. Also, helping employees understand the implications of working in a large command and control organization and how to flourish in that environment. Lack of this type of coaching can leave employees feeling under appreciated and treated like numbers instead of feeling like part of a well oiled machine. I don't necessarily think that the company needs to change, I just think there is opportunity to get more training for the management staff which I think can bring lots of benefits to the entire organization.",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0
