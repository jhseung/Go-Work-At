There's no limit on learning here- With their plethora of customers, I personally got(& had) to learn a lot to be able to cater to such challenging things they sometimes put ahead technically!

2. Earning (Cos learning alone doesn't fill my stomach)- I obviously wouldn't tell u the figure, but I'm more than happy to b able to upgrade my living every year, thanks to them ;)

3. Work-life balance- Hands down the best I've seen(Yes, this is just my second company, but I say this after analyzing the lives of my friends at other organizations)

4. The Team, the peers, the flexibility- This is one place where I don't have to lie about why I had to take a day-off; this goes out to the wonderful people here who understand that unforeseen things(or not) can come up at times! People here have ur back and when u work here, they become more of a family.

5. The Harvey Spectre vibe- I personally like heading meetings and taking sessions, so my quench of facing new people, traveling new places, explaining and exploring tech and engineering, all with a Harvey vibe has been fulfilled here. B)","1. Open ur mouth, speak- Since u might have to deal a lot with customers, u have to be able to speak open and clear. (and I guess this is how it is with any organization in the world) Customer obviously isn't ur love interest to understand the language of ur eyes.

2. Patience is a virtue- I wouldn't lie, but at times an unsatisfied customer can get on ur nerves and u still have to act like the monk who sold his Ferrari.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
