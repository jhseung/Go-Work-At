2019-02-01," Manager, North America Decision Analytics Support","Allen, TX",Former Employee ,Worst experience I have ever had at a company,Worst experience I have ever had at a company,0,Health care plans are good.,"This place is run in the US in a lot of ways like it's run out of someone's garage. Light on processes, objectives are not disseminated by management, employees don't understand the overall vision for the business because it's not being communicated at all. There are virtually zero attempts at team building or truly educating the members of teams to make them more effective in their roles.

The senior management team claims they are focused on maintaining a high performance environment, but at the same time are unwilling to pay for high performing employees. Senior managers don't listen to the rank and file or front line managers to see if they are clear on the direction they are taking the company or if their leadership is working.

Senior leadership constantly make decisions in a vacuum, resulting in a constant churn of stress and client issues - and problems with employee satisfaction in their roles. In two years of employment I went through three large scale reorganizations and three different managers. Suffice to say that stability is not Experian's strong suit.

Experian also went to an offshore contractor model in the last few years, implementing it in a stupid, sort of plodding one size fits all way. The results have been mixed to poor but the senior management team loves it because the bottom line looks fantastic with all the money that was saved by firing all those American full time employees and replacing them with cheap contract labor (that don't know the job). Experian could be a world class company if they decided to focus less on the bottom line (they are already generating a ton of revenue) and more on customer excellence and employee development. In fact the bottom line would look even better if the focus were shifted appropriately.

Overall I'd say the problem with Experian in the US is specifically leadership at the VP level and above. Over time, the way they are managing the direction of the company will drive the most experienced, senior people on the front line out, and all that money they've saved will turn out to be a wasted opportunity for future gains. Ironically all those managers will probably be gone by the time things begin to fail.

The problem is that Experian sells very specific, proprietary products and services and it takes years for someone to truly be effective creating and selling those products and services. People with the knowledge needed to fill technical roles at Experian do not exist in the marketplace. They have to be trained after being hired to actually do the job working on products and services that only exist at Experian. This isn't well suited to a contractor model, and it lends itself to having higher paid, more technically proficient employees who can learn quickly in order to be successful. Since Experian's US leadership isn't interested in doing either of these things, instead focusing on achieving short term gains at the expense of the long term, I don't think the future bodes well for the company's continued success in the United States.

I'm relieved that I don't work there anymore. I've got a long history working for large, successful Fortune 100 corporations. This was the most stressful, frustrating experience I have ever had working for a company.","You need to take a long, hard look at your executive management team in the US, and identify why the massive gaps in communication and consistent failure to provide a proper vision to the employee community exists.",1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

I'm not sure how the other 6 were even able to become supervisors.
- What's the point in having a pizza party or a potluck if they don't give us time off the phones to eat? So you're basically still taking calls while trying to eat,
- We were told one thing in training then told the complete opposite when we started taking calls. What's the point in have training if we're told to do the opposite of what we learned once we're out on the floor.
- You get points deducted for dumb stuff when it comes to quality assurance. I got points deducted for something that we WEREN'T taught in training and when I asked a sup they didn't know the answer either, I also got points deducted because I sighed on the phone because my systems went from working to all of a sudden being down. Also got points deducted because I was told one thing in training just to find out when I got graded that what we were told in training was incorrect.
- The systems that are used are trash. They're either down or going extremely slow.
- You are basically billing, technical support, credit education, and a lot more but that is not reflected in the pay.
- Customers are told to call in if they have certain questions just for us to have to tell them that we don't have the answer. If they call because their score dropped there's no way for us to know what caused it but for whatever reason, the website tells them to call us which results in A LOT of angry customers.
- There's no reason people should be on hold for 2+ hours to do something as simple as getting a password reset, cancel a membership, or update payment which takes less than 2 minutes for the agent to do.
- You have to be dispute trained to move up, which is up to your supervisors' supervisor.","Make sure that the people your are making supervisors actually know what they are talking about and are willing to help the agents. Let customers know that the agents are not able to tell them certain information like why there score dropped or why they were denied credit.

I have several colleagues who have been with the company over 40 years! That's gotta say something, right? The benefits here are also pretty amazing. For example, they really value loyalty here, so the longer you're at the company, the more accelerated your paid time off is. They start you off at 15 accrued paid days off, and after 2 years with the company, they already bump you up to 20 days off per year - and that's not including the 10 paid holidays and 5 days of sick time either! You get 5 days of sick time per year with no need to accrue. It doesn't roll over, but you get it automatically at the start of every year. Depending on your team, there's a lot of work/life balance with opportunities to work from home if needed. The maternity leave is also generous here, so it's a great place to work if you plan to start a family or already have one. They have an employee stock purchase plan that has really paid off, giving employees 15% off the lowest fair market rate, and they match 401 (k) at 4% (100% vested). They even have a 401 (k) Roth option as well if you prefer everything to be after taxes. I also think the pay is really competitive compared to others in the area.

Forget about Eclipse, Atom, Cloud9 -- you are screwed! Lets say you install a Linux Shell and wget an editor...busted. You cant even install personal productivity software on your work computer. Think for second, why does a place so anal about security run windows? Makes no sense at all...how much malware/rats/viruses have been dropped on Ubuntu or Open Office? Don't walk away from your desk to go workout--forget about work life balance--that is corporate BS too. When I came back, I had a Kensington Lock on my computer and chair--how humiliating.

I never got one for my computer, so what was the point, short of humiliation.","Trust your people and treat them like they have a brain, or give them a severance and send them home.
