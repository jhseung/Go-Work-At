It can be tough finding a start-up company in Austin that builds its foundation with compassion and the importance of culture. I feel incredibly grateful to have found Honor. There are so many tech start-ups in Austin but most of their products and services are for the millenial generation, which is great, but Honor is using technology to help the aging adult population receive the care they deserve. Every day I wake up, no matter how tired I may be, I am so excited to come to work because I know I have an incredible team of talented, kind, and empathetic individuals and the work we are doing has a direct impact on families and their loved ones. It's truly rewarding work and the company not only treats its clients with compassion but compassion is shown to everyone throughout the organization. There's never a time I have walked into work. no matter what office I was in, and wasn't greeted by someone with a warm smile. We are fed lunch every day that encompasses all dietary needs (gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan), the organization is incredibly diverse, and there is so much opportunity for individual growth. I am happy to not only call honor my job but also my home.","There is always constant change in the organization.

2018-12-21,,,Current Employee ,Employees Pushed to Their Breaking Points,More than a year,0,Getting a paycheck and benefits.,"I’ve been working at Honor for well over a year, and as the company continues to grow, they seem to care less and less about the employees making things happen, and only the money that goes into their wallets.

Some days are good, but most are overwhelming. They put a huge amount of pressure on people and overload you with work. It’s not okay to make mistakes here, so employees are living in a constant heightened state of panic about what will happen if they mess up.

People who raise their hands saying they need help aren’t taken seriously, so when things start falling through the cracks, managers will be on you about why this is happening - even if you raised your hand long ago saying you need more support.

The amount of time you have to work in a day to keep up is unreasonable, and then they tell employees they have to be on call on the weekends. Note there that I said tell - not ask. Honor loves to sell employees on their big ideas, and once people commit, they change everything under your nose into something you never agreed to - but have no choice but to accept. If you try to push back, they give you some BS reasoning as to why they’re doing what they’re doing, and leave you feeling terrible for raising valid concerns.

This is a toxic environment that doesn’t allow you any time outside of the office to recharge and regenerate.

Having worked there for a while and seeing what it used to be to what it is now is upsetting and discouraging. I understand that as companies do well and grow, things will have to change. It’s just unfortunate that as all these changes are made, the well-being of the employees aren’t taken into consideration - or maybe their well-being is taken into consideration, and that Honor just doesn’t care if they break good employees.","You need to start making some major changes to improve the quality of your employees’ lives in the office, in terms of alleviating work loads. Also major changes need to be made in order to improve the quality of work / life balance.

You will lose amazing and hard working employees if you continue to treat your employees like workhorses, and having zero regard for the crushing pressure you are imposing on people.",2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0

- Feedback is a Gift: On the whole, Honor is comprised of people who have very low egos and want to continuously improve. Feedback is more often than not welcome and most importantly, acted upon as the company strives to improve its service to clients/Care Professionals and the working experience for employees.","- Broader Communication Channels: As the company has grown and as decisions continue to be made on a relatively real-time basis, it can sometimes become difficult to communicate those decisions to those whose daily roles/functions they would impact.

- Work Hard, Play Hard: Honor has a relatively serious, outcomes-focused culture that is driven from the belief and expectation the company places amongst its employees to do right by clients and Care Pros.

2018-08-09, Product Designer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Not a typical tech company,More than a year,0,"The team at Honor is the most diverse and cooperative group of people I have ever worked with. Honor operates in a unique and complex industry, which I think attracts more mission-driven and empathetic employees. I believe in the leadership's ability to make Honor a successful company, as the founders are seasoned and have previously founded companies (which were also successful).

It has a much more family-oriented culture than other startups I have worked at (or heard about second-hand), which means that work-life balance is really important.

As a product designer, it's a very interesting place to work, because of the complexity of the problems we're solving and the wide differences in our audiences.","Honor lacks some of the perks that can be found at larger companies in San Francisco. We don't have gym stipends, kegerators, or in-house chefs. (In the SF office, we have catered lunch 3 days a week and a stocked kitchen, and that's fine with me.) In general, I would say the non-comp perks may be relatively modest compared to other venture-backed startups.

- Success here is measured by how many individuals receive high quality care as they age, and by the level of dignity provided and opportunity created for caregivers. It's inspiring to be part of a company that is using tech to improve the human delivery of healthcare, and that is changing a truly broken home care (and more broadly, health care) system.
- Co-founders and leadership have extensive experience and their eyes on the right targets.","- Things move quickly at Honor and there's always a lot to get done, which means that there are sometimes unrealistic expectations about the amount that can be completed in one day.
- Each team has a distinct culture. I got lucky with my team but overall I see Honor as a fairly serious culture. In other words, on the work hard play hard scale, it's tipped more to the former. The plus side of that is that people take the work we do really seriously and you can really count on others to follow-through; the flip side is that there are few opportunities to let loose with colleagues.","- Would be great to see additional perks (401k, health & wellness benefits) and explicit diversity initiatives (in hiring, relationships with external affinity groups, etc) as we grow.

That's why I have to write this review.,"A questionable re-org a couple of months ago left one team in a bad spot. Since then, key employees who were some of the most talented people have left. This is normal with startups, and usually nothing to be too worried about. But it becomes a problem when people inside and outside the team start noticing and questioning how this team is run. The team once comprised of people from diverse experiences. The team now consists of people that don't really understand the product, the industry... or what they are supposed to do. The leader of this team is proud about their 'openness to feedback', but addressing anything directly is met with arrogance and talking badly about the rest of the executive team. It's hard to collaborate on a deep level with this leader. It didn't used to be this way, and it's not supposed to trend in that direction.",Please monitor the quality of leaders and their strategy more closely. In particular people running teams that work on projects the public sees. It would be great be to get transparency about when these concerns will be addressed.

Health benefits and PTO policy became increasingly worse, employees were guilt tripped for taking time off- despite working far over 40 hours a week.

Salary is incredibly low for the work that is expected of employees.

Certain teams receive most recognition, there are very clear favorites.

In my almost 2 years at Honor, I never received a raise or a bonus. (No performance reviews)

The culture is toxic, employees are burnt out.

You are expected to work through your lunch, they may not explicitly say to not take a break, but it is frowned upon if you actually leave your desk for lunch. (This is different for the technical/eng teams)

Turnover is extremely high due to all of the above.",Value your employees and compensate them fairly. Listen to your employees concerns. Foster a healthy work culture and respect work life balance.,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
2018-07-12, Car Team Member,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,How the mighty have fallen...,More than 3 years,0,"At first, I was literally excited to come every single day for work. Anyone who was there from the beginning knows that honor COULD have been something incredible...","But now None and I mean NONE of the original team members are around. You ask why? The worst, I mean THE ABSOLUTE WORST middle managers/heads of teams were hired. We saw people people that were there since the inception of Honor getting fired or quitting because incompetent managers were being hired. After the original head of care left, that was the beginning of the end if you ask me. Middle managers starting quitting and getting replaced by absolutely INCOMPETENT and RUDE people that had ZERO clue what there were doing. And as such, even they were given the boot and replaced by even worse people!! Seriously, it was the perfect example of a revolving door; managers would hire 5 people, then 2 weeks later fire 3 of them, and start over with hiring another 5 people and firing most of them! No clue how HR let this happen.

Don't fall for their facade. It's an excellent idea on paper but the company itself has fallen and can't get up...","It's obvious the founders have lost touch of what was special about Honor. All about $$$, which is incredibly sad. Whomever was in charge of hiring the middle managers and higher should be ashamed as well as anyone in the hiring process that let these incompetent ""managers"" join honor when it's clear as day there was a culture clash. The team members are the ones getting fired and of course management takes ZERO RESPONSIBILITY. To sum everything up, the day someone quit or got fired, they breathed the biggest sigh of relief that they were no longer associated with Honor.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
