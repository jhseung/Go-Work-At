2018-09-11, Internal Employee,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"A wonderful place to work, filled with hardworking people!","A wonderful place to work, filled with hardworking people!",0,"1. The Maven team is incredibly collaborative and supportive. We all work together to help candidates find their dream roles and to exceed our clients' expectations. Each individual is driven, hardworking, creative and dedicated which explains why our team is so close-knit. The learning opportunities here are endless!

2. Our CEO is one-of-a-kind. She is selfless, hands-on and brilliant in the way that she leads our team each day. She pushes us, inspires us and coaches us to be the best that we can be in our own roles and as a team. She is a HUGE reason why I joined Maven!

3. We have some incredible benefits and perks. First and foremost, our office is gorgeous... the second I walked through the doors for my interview, I immediately felt at home. Not only do we get free meals and company outings, but we also have the opportunity to work remotely twice a month.","The Mavens truly embody the ""work hard, play hard"" mantra which is why we've achieved great success. This is a team that works late if need be and communicates with their candidates after hours to ensure their experience with Maven is seamless. If you are seeking a job to simply clock in and clock out, this industry / workplace may not be the perfect fit.","Thank you for walking the walk and inspiring our team everyday. I certainly appreciate the flexibility, openness and opportunity that our leaders offer our team.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2017-03-28, Recruiter,,Current Employee ,The Way Recruiting Should Be!,The Way Recruiting Should Be!,0,"This is a place that is based on transparency, being genuine, and where it's okay to lead with not only your head but your heart. This is truly a place where candidates are valued as much as the clients. I love that it is seen as our job here to scope out the intangibles, make lasting connections with candidates, and to not only be a resource and adviser, but as a support system throughout the interview process. This is a team of incredibly kind, driven, and intelligent women who come to work every day to work hard, and who care about what they do. I feel very grateful to be a part of a company that has not only fostered so much professional growth within myself, but in all the candidates that we place as well.","If you're looking for a job where you can clock out at 5:00PM every day, this is not the place for you. However, staying late is not a characteristic that solely belongs to Maven- in general this is true of most recruiting agencies. The upside is that when you stay later and put in extra work, you see the direct results in the number of candidates that you place.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

2017-01-25, Anonymous Freelancer,,Former Freelancer ,SHADY COMPANY!,SHADY COMPANY!,0,The people there are nice... but read below.,"This review is more on the company itself. They contact you via email, then through phone, and then they set up an interview. They were really nice via email and phone, so I thought this would be a great opportunity. Boy was I wrong! It was a terrible experience. Apparently they post ads that do not disclose they are a recruiting agency, and you only find out through conducting research on the company name (via their email addresses). The had me come in (I had to take Bart from far away) only to do a 15 minute interview. What a waste of time. Apparently it was a ""test"" to see how well I'd do for REAL* interviews. Thus, I didn't interview for the actual position I applied for.. And again, they did not disclose that. They made it seem via phone and email that I would be interviewing for the actual position they posted on Craigslist. WELL SURPRISE! That job probably wasn't even real...

They also take ALL of your info down, and ask you to provide your resume and fill out a form that asks for even more details. They also say that they will look for opportunities for you and will be in contact soon. Well.. It's been two months and I haven't heard from anyone! And please note, I have exceptional experience, and I am definitely qualified for the position they posted. They most likely just wanted to use my resume and other information I provided to acquire more business without actually helping me (by contacting my previous employers and trying to get them as clients). They also gave me a lot of false promises and hope - how they have tons of clients who are looking for good workers, etc etc. Well if that’s the case, why didn’t you contact me? Why didn’t you set up an interview for me like you said you would? I wouldn't provide much information honestly or trust this company. It was really sketchy and my gut told me so when I was filling out another form that asked for in depth details. Unfortunately I realized it was a scam after the interview. /= At least other ""recruiters"" actually contact you and they are acting in trying to set something up for you. I haven't heard anything from this company until now, and now they have all of my info. BE CAREFUL!!","Disclose you are a recruiting agency! Don't have people come in thinking they're interviewing for the job they applied for. Also, stay true to your word! If you have no time to help other people find a job, then stop ""recruiting"" and taking people's info down and then giving them false promises.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
2016-12-08, Direct Hire Recruiter,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,So lucky to have found my dream team!,So lucky to have found my dream team!,0,"I'm grateful to be a Maven every single day for countless reasons and here are a few reasons as to why:
• Not a day goes by when I don't learn something new whether it's sharpening some techniques or learning about a brand new company. I'm constantly developing and being challenged as a professional and individual.
• Maven has an incredible, dynamic, and diverse team filled with absolutely wonderful people with the most unique, eclectic backgrounds. The synergy in our gorgeous office is infectious, which makes work an enjoyable place to be at every single day.
• I absolutely admire and respect all the leaders behind this steadfast, growing, ambitious company. They're all insanely driven, naturals at inspiring others, have great taste in food, embrace humorous personalities and above all they have large hearts and big brains filled with vast knowledge/experience in this industry! My current manager is very selfless and undeniably caring and supportive of my professional success and personal well-being. Within a year I can confidently say that I've grown immensely in my role thanks to her! Our CEO is also absolutely incredible. I could say so many admirable things about her commitment to our team, clients and candidates' success and happiness. I also love being able to work so closely with her.
• Simply put, I absolutely love our network and I'm always astonished by the types of companies/executives that we partner with. I also appreciate our company's mission and values.
• Lastly, management genuinely cares about your professional growth. I've been able to express some ideas and seen them come to life! I've also been comfortable enough to speak about my personal goals and I love how my manager works with me on developing a tangible action plan.
• Last thing, I feel like we are spoiled at Maven with the amazing perks. Some of our team outings are my favorite Bay Area memories, and I definitely had the best Maui trip, ever! President’s Club amazing!","This is a company/team who is committed to success. We are in the business of people and these people entrust us with a crucial part in their life or business. This is an ambitious team and we strive to go beyond for our candidates and clients. If you like to clock in and clock out on time every day and completely check-out after work then this may not be the right industry or team for you. If you're someone who doesn't mind being dialed in off hours to do a last minute candidate prep call or stay a few extra hours to get work done then we are the team for you! This type of work ethic has shown me how to be truly successful in my role and for my candidates and team. Personally speaking, I feel like we all embrace a nice work-life balance. When I go on 1-2 week trips my team covers for me in a heartbeat and they respect the time that I’m away. We are a true work hard play hard environment filled with lots of fun and growth opportunities!","None, you all are doing fabulous! Thank you for being open to feedback, for all of the immense support, and for coaching us to be the absolute best that we can be in our roles.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

One thing that impresses me the most about working at Maven is how tight-knit the team is. Everyone works together really well, and you know that you can count on your teammates - that's huge in a work culture.","The traffic outside can get loud - but I'm pretty sure that's everywhere in the financial district.
