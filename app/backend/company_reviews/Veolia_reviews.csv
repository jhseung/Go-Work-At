Enter the good old boys club. Being a female in middle management it became obvious that diversity was lip service. Upper management entirely comprised of white men. An after taste of agenda started to become apparent in the newly promoted upper management. By 2016 the HR team had evolved into bullies. They created distrust between employees and employers, the are viewed as political players as they add no value to the bottom line. Management often gives everyone the same rewards, regardless of contribution or experience. Telling top performers that it wouldn’t be fair to others will do little to inspire additional commitment. Productivity is also hurt by poor information technology, employees have to navigate different systems and locations to find what they need.","An organization’s mission statement should be a part of everything it does, from the work to the company culture to how the organization engages employees with that mission. Alignment must be clear, at every level, so that the company is living up to its own core values. While the company evolves to survive, HR is decades behind. HR should be developing a work environment and culture that enables people to thrive. Treat people like individuals. Reward those who deserve to be rewarded and be prepared to tell others why they are not receiving the same treatment.

Some of the technical staff are world-class.,"Less than stellar ethics amongst several individuals in the “top” management of Veolia North America (VNA).
Also, the current crop of Senior leaders have an operations background and hence see everything in operations terms.

They have close to zero idea on how to grow the company (“Business Development”) and assume an operations mindset is transferable to BD.

In the past 2-years, near- Constant reorganization has gutted BD; about 20-mid-to-senior BD executives (especially in the M&C group) have been summarily fired or just quit. People do leave, but when you have such a large churn in such a short period of time, the logical reason is a percussive culture of deceit and deception amongst VNA top management.

The annual strategy meetings are an example of kiss-up, kick down.
Net-net, the company is losing contracts to its competitors.

Again, VNA is an OK place if you want an operations focused career.

The company is constantly changing its focus and projects are often left unfinished when new issues or projects arise, making it extremely challenging to complete goals. Change appears to be made at the whim of the senior management. For example, the company is moving all corporate employees to one central office in a high cost-of-living city, with very little office space to accommodate newly transferred employees. Company is also moving payroll-related functions to a new city at the same time they are transitioning to a new work platform. Said moves are resulting in a huge loss of institutional knowledge for employees rejecting relocation. Other regional offices and home-based workers beware...no job is safe.) There is a significant lack of communication between key corporate departments resulting in duplication of efforts, or in some cases, certain departments are taking reign over certain processes with little or no vetting to those impacted with these changes. Shelf-life of the North American CEO role is typically 3 years. If you can stay around and weather another change it might get better - or it might get worse.",Pick a direction and stay with it.

Speaking in general terms, this is a great company to work for. I have learned more in my first year than during the entire 16-years at my previous company. Big changes and improvements are planned and anticipated to be implemented and online within a couple of years. The company sends out surveys to solicit feedback directly from their employees in order to hear their opinions rather than management's version of their employees opinions. The company is showing strong growth with bright prospects for the future. Locally, many of the people I work with are bright and hard-working.","The various branches, facilities, and locations are not harmonized. It seems as though when Veolia acquires a location, that location is not fully assimilated into the Veolia way of doing business. This means that when one branch is dealing with another branch, it's like two different businesses dealing with each other. This leads to redundancies in tasks which increases work-load and decreases efficiency. Many of the IT systems seem to be plagued by the same culture. There is lots of manual data re-entry because one part of the system cannot talk to another part of the system. There is quite a bit of bureaucracy to getting a proposed upgrade of the system, no matter how minor. This issue along with the epic disconnect between the branches is being addressed at the corporate level and is expected to be resolved within the next couple of years. However, as is human nature, most people are resistant to change so they dig in their heels which further slows the process.
Corporate has indicated they listen to employee surveys but results seem to take several years. Locally, employee turnover is fairly high, probably because there is no advancement. Do something well for a couple of years and, during the review, the manager agrees you're doing well but to give it another year before discussing advancement. Then, get the same story next year. There is no incentive for management to move good employees up because it's so difficult and expensive to fill your position. The company line includes great advancement opportunities but the local management doesn't share that view.","At the corporate level, rather than pouring money into facebook-style company websites, use that money to expedite the harmonization of all branches and standardization of operation procedures.
At the local level, when your employees say they want to advance or move on to a different job, that should be a red-flag with neon lights around it. They are no longer fulfilled with their job. Each employee is an asset that Veolia has invested considerable money, time, and resources. Sincerely help the employee make that change happen or you will lose them to a different company.

Toxic Environment where everybody is selfish and protective of their on roles for fears that their jobs will be taken over by more capable colleagues, this stems from the fact that there are people who has been there for 8-10 years in the company and never had work any other companies before. They have started off their career as an administrator or accounts payable and moved their way up to the company, therefore very poor interpersonal skills and single minded thinking.

2. Unnecessary overtime and multiple rework. Excessive and unnecessary overtime is seen as a method of 'working hard' by management even though you are doing absolute nothing at your desk. (10-12 hours daily basis). Micromanagement is seen in all levels.

3. Overly inflated job titles. Most of the time you will be doing accounts payable and administrative task regardless of your job titles.

4. Taking other colleagues credits and does not own up to mistakes, specialised in playing the 'blaming game'. Throwing colleagues which has left the business under the bus to mask the culprit.

5. Multiple layers of management which does not advocate uniformity. Hence a lot of reworking just to fit in multiple individual requirement just for the sake of it. But substances being the same source.

6. Strong office politics. Power and adherence lies within those who has been there the longest in the company, sadly great ideas and innovative approaches does not have a place here.
