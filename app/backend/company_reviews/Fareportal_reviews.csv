The turnover rate is whiplash-inducing. There's an unsettling combination of team members giving their 2-week's notice on a near-daily basis, sprinkled with regular and sudden terminations.
Other noteworthy concerns are top-to-bottom structures, misogyny, restricted internet access, and absent management.
The most frustrating component of all, however, is the lack of focus concerning benefits and human resources. I find that Fareportal employees often have to keep track of their own hours, vacation time, and health insurance. It is not unusual for administrative oversights to have serious consequences on your healthcare, or for the benefits platform to crash for months at a time. Either this department is very understaffed, or simply negligent. Every day is truly a battle to redeem your basic benefits.","Fareportal's eye for talent acquisition gives the company some serious potential.

Very few HR staff seem to really work, most of them seem to have a lot of spare time and set a bad example for the unmotivated workers to do the same. Most of their time seem to be spent on socials and games and Charity work to get them good advertising.

Also, full-time employees are required to sign in and record hours in-office everyday and even if you are salary, if you don't log the appropriate hours they will short-pay you. The bathrooms are horrendous and the general hygiene and cleanliness in the office is questionable even though (to save money) they have cleaning crews vacuum the office in the middle of the day when meetings and calls are going on.

The company will take advantage of you if you let them regarding pay and vacation. Sam, the CEO, does not believe in investing in employees. The result of that becomes crappy and expensive health benefits, low employee morale, no merit increases, some lies, and a recent bed bug issue. No work from home option.

There is no real 401K, so HR should stop telling people we have a 401K as a benefit. The reason I say this is because it does not match, at all. A 401K that has no match, is useless, stop selling it as a benefit. There is no true benefit to using the pre-tax benefit for my commute costs. Having the ability for Transitchek is by law because the company has more than 20 employees in NYC. If I wanted to obtain the same benefit, I would include it in my taxes during tax season.

The company has a severe communication issue and this is because HR does not take control of the problem by communicating on management's behalf and rely on managers telling it for them. For those who work with Sam, good luck getting a word in that is not a response to a question he asks. He is a bit rude too as he has no care what you have to say, because it's obviously important to hear only what he says. He's also a bit of an idiot too as he'll contradict himself with his actions.","Senior Management is really out of touch with the reality of their workplace. You won't give the merit increases to your current employees, but you'll keep hiring new employees with high salaries.

There is a reason that a lot of people are leaving lately, and it will continue until the CEO finally decides to make a true investment in his employees. You need to upgrade your health benefits, provide a work from home option, provide merit increases before hiring more people, give better compensation instead of low balling people because you can, and re-vamp the commute cost by possibly paying for it altogether.

HR is completely dysfunctional. The only job they do right is to see if the employees clock in and clock out on time. (Exempt full time employees are also required to clock in and clock out)
In 2014, they gave the employees 3 weeks vacation and 5 sick days. However, they have still not updated the vacation days in the system. If the employee realizes that he/she is accruing at a lower rate and emails the HR. That is when he/she will be awarded the additional days. This is how the company functions. This is a lawsuit in the waiting.
The company is full of dishonest and incompetent middle managers. Most of the good people have left the company. The employees remaining are the ones who need a visa to stay in the country.

That's what it feels like to work at Fareportal.

If you scroll up on this page to the ""Join Us"" section, you'll see several sections of them explaining why you should work at Fareportal. Here's the truth in these sections that they don't tell you. You might want to sit down as you read this:

1. We'll Help Your Career Reach New Heights: LOL. They don't actually care about your career or what your career goals are for yourself. You ask to do certain types of work to help yourself reach those goals, but instead you're given menial, busywork that really hurts your knowledge and skill level and prevents you from ever climbing the corporate ladder. It's more like sliding down the chute because you had an unfortunate roll of the dice. You can get ""promoted"" by them changing your title, but at this company titles mean absolutely nothing. Your job responsibilities won't change and you'll still be treated like a drone. It's like you flat line and there's no sense of revival.

2. Top-Notch Coverage: Should be more like Mediocre-Notch Coverage. If you have a family, enjoy the large amount that comes out of your paycheck. If you are single, enjoy the amount you have to pay for something that you will only use probably once a year if you are a relatively healthy person. Also, you can enjoy how a lot of doctors don't take the health insurance, but if they do, enjoy the co-pay at every appointment. Disability insurance, more like if you need to stay home from work due to a medical reason, enjoy not getting paid. Ever.

3. Time to Play: Work Hard, Play Hard. Should be Work Hard, but You're Not Working Hard Enough So No Play Time. The vacation days you get are pretty good, if you can ever get your manager to approve it. Work from home does not exist because they took away VPN access. You take a week's vacation and it feels like you never even had time to relax when you return, because it is a dark dungeon-esque creature eating away at your soul, slowly for every day of your life.

4. Here's to Your Health: Fitness classes at work, inside of a small room, with your coworkers. Sounds like a good time to me. Said no one ever. But, if you're into that then more power to you. Or, you can leave work at your designated time and go to a gym where workouts are meant to be held. Maybe that's just me, though.

5. Your Future Starts Here: Your future starts here, but will also end here if you don't make the executive life decision to leave for a different company. Competitive salaries? Where? Not here. They will low-ball you to the max and underpay you to the point where you ask yourself if it's really worth it. The answer is almost always, no, it's not worth it. The pay is WAY below industry average. The 401k is a nice benefit, but they don't match, so there's that.

6. Additional Perks: Travel discounts? I mean, if you consider $20 being a discount from a $500 flight then I guess you'd be happy. The discount doesn't even get applied to the actual ticket, it's towards the taxes & fees. Free food and drinks on the occasion are nice, though can be difficult on the digestive system if you know what I mean. The occasional drink that's served ""after-hours"" is nice but, in reality, who wants to actually stay after work for a beer when you can go to your home and enjoy one in the comfort of your home.

I have found myself shaking my head at this company many times. The level of disrespect some people give to others is remarkable. Your good work will go nowhere but the waiting line to the fast track to the garbage can. There is no structure, no strategy, and no chance for any kind of growth. Prepare yourself for high levels of sexism and feelings of being inferior. People are condescending and they do not care. The bathrooms are probably one of the most disgusting things I have ever used in my life. I can go on and on and on about what I don't like about this company but the world might end before I can finish. If you want to flat line in the middle of your career, this place is for you.

-Their definition of business casual includes jeans","-The company offers employees the state mandated sick time and not any more (they will deduct from your paycheck if you are out more than the allotted amount)
-You are mandated to clock in and out daily (first time I have had to do this as a full time employee), and you will get an email if you happen to work under 40 hours that week
-No work from home (this will result in a deduction from your paycheck). In a response to a review on here, compliance was cited as the reason for no work from home, this is NOT true, select employees do it on a regular basis
-The company will only issue desktops, there are NO laptops and NO vpn, oh and NO WIFI in the office (this was taken away in an attempt to increase employee productivity at the demand of the owner)
-The office is poorly run, extremely incompetent management, they don't seem to care about quality and just want production
-Titles are used to assert authority rather than successfully run the org and DO NOT reflect experience or competence. Senior executives at the company would never be able to hold their own weight elsewhere (let alone, get hired elsewhere)
-Benefits are far below industry standard, and even after a new vacation policy was implemented it only lasted a couple months. And travel benefits are a joke (and mostly non-existant), maybe there's an occasional fare deal through a partner but these are usually available to the public
-Racism and sexism is REAL AND ALIVE (as is favoritism)! The company is headquartered in India and it is clear that managers favor candidates of Indian descent, and the Indian folks seem to be the only ones who get promoted (if there's not a promotable Indian in the office, they will relocate one from the main office in India).
-HR management and their team is laughably incompetent, senior HR feels that responding to online reviews is a solution rather than meeting with employees to address the issues and get feedback. They never seem to accomplish a whole lot other than running around the office frantically, and planning the holiday party
-HR has proven themselves to be untrustworthy, so employees don't go to them with issues
-The owner of the company does not listen to an opinion that is different than his, and if he is in a meeting he will not let anyone else speak (he needs to be the center of attention and will raise his voice aggressively, which makes employees afraid of him, so they just placate him, this is a HUGE barrier to innovation and future success of the company)
-Senior management is EXTREMELY overcompensated, and they are rewarded for the overall team's performance
-The HR team pressures employees into writing positive reviews on glassdoor, and the HR team writes reviews as well. They make sure to space them out so it seems like they are actually from happy employees (find it suspicious that all the reviews of US office are either atrocious or perfect? The perfect ones are from employees who are put in awkward positions by HR)

- Much higher pay than industry standard
- A lot of freedom to take a rope and climb it or take a rope and hang yourself with it
- Plenty of room for growth
- Incentive plans for marketing goals
- Reasonable goals
- Encouraged team collaboration
- Relaxed atmosphere; very little to no micro-management

I have worked here just about 2 years and have been promoted twice, given an incentive plan that has been increased twice, and had a substantial raise from my starting salary. I happened upon our page after a friend mentioned their company's poor reviews and was curious what my own company had.

I cannot believe that some of the people here have written some of the things they've said. Never have I seen racism or sexism in the workplace, we don't sit in cubicles we are on long tables by team (not with walls up blocking your neighbor), our off-shore team in India isn't outsourced, they are part of our company. I think the people that say hard work goes unnoticed expects a 20% increase for a month of hard work. Try making it a regular day-to-day goal to work hard and you will see growth, promotions, and salary increase.","No company is without it's pitfalls. Some that Fareportal honestly have are:

- No work from home policy. Which is unfortunate as a marketer because much of my work can be done from home, but I know certain teams at FP cannot thus we all suffer

- HR does a poor job of responding to requests. As a big company and a small HR team, I can understand how things get lost. Following-up is a must and things do get accomplished if you speak in person

- Upper management does need to put more trust into it's mid level managers. We are promoted for a reason, trust us!

- Certain people are awful at responding to emails and this requires a follow-up in person

- Meetings rarely start on time and are often rescheduled","Trust your employees, at least the ones you have had around for several years and have promoted to mid-level managerial titles.

If consumers checked with most any other travel company or even directly with an airline website, a smart consumer would know they are being sucked dry with service fees from $25 to well over $3000 per ticket purchase. If a customer complains they may be told that they agreed to the charge but if they really threaten a lawyer or court, the may get a discount or refund. Make sure you verify your tickets are issued by contacting the airline since the agents who book you don't ticket you. Your reservation is processed by another department where it is often forgotten and you only find out when you get to the airport. The agents are paid no on the sales made but in the amount of markup they can squeeze out of a customer. Some may call this unethical be but there is no definition of ethical at Fareportal. The agents have zero training and are stressed and frustrated. The benefits are ok, but with 2 weeks vacation which cannot be taken as a 2 week leave unless you are Indian or Pakistani and go to your home country for vacation. For some reason they can take a month vacation instead of 2 weeks.

Some responders say it so great to have all these yoga, kick boxing, and such available at work but it only applies to accounting, marketing and automation departments, not the travel agents who are not allowed to participate unless they are off schedule.

2. Management has zero knowledge on certain subject matters but will make any/all decisions regardless of input from employees.
