2019-02-06, Statistician,,Current Employee ,Great Place to Work (SCHARP),Great Place to Work (SCHARP),0,"This review is for the Statistical Center for HIV and AIDS Research and Prevention (SCHARP), which is a organization within Fred Hutch.

- Brilliant staff, faculty, and investigators. You'll work with some investigators and faculty who are literally among the best in the world in their field.

- Great atmosphere. People are generally friendly, supportive, and professional.

- You'll have the opportunity to work on some really neat studies and projects.

- The Fred Hutch campus is really pretty with a lot of areas to take a break inside and outside.

- Flexible work schedules with the possibility to work from home a day or two a week.

- Great health insurance and sick leave allowance.

- Lower level managers are generally supportive and respond well to new ideas.

- The organization is making a genuine effort to streamline inefficient processes.

- You are allowed to work mostly independently.

- Excellent work-life balance. Rare that you have to work more than 40 hours a week.","- The cafeteria food is very healthy but also not very good. It's also overpriced.

- No on campus gym or recreational areas.

- Some projects are mind numbingly boring, and there are a lot of processes that are currently delegated to statisticians hat should be delegated to nonstatisticians.

- The pay is what you would expect for a non-profit.

- Initial vacation time is only 2 weeks. This is not competitive with the private sector for which 3 weeks is fairly standard.

- Vertical advancement is limited.

- The organizations efforts to implement new regulatory standards has created more bureaucracy, making it harder for people to do their jobs.","Continue on the path you've set, but try a little harder to get feedback from specific groups on ways that their experience can be improved.",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0

This is a very academic institution (each lab is it's own entity), with the business/ shared IT resources being more like a traditional business. The academic flavor brings a fair amount of flexibility in terms of your work schedule/ arrangements (dependent on which PI you work for), and the benefits are great!","Because the institution is fairly academic, you can feel a little siloed from others (although that is changing with ""The Coop"" being a newly created entity to try to bring data scientists/ analysts from across the organization together).

Career Progression/ continuing education is pretty much something you have to figure out yourself (there is no clear guidance in this regard, unless you are in a tenure-track lab-PI position), and it is easy to end up ""stuck"" in the same position for decades even (your PI may never bring up conversations about what your 1 to 5-year plan/goals are). They have recently implemented scholarships for individuals to go to summer schools, etc, but this is something you have to compete to receive (as opposed to a guaranteed funding commitment to your career progression). Granted, this is a non-profit, so it is understandable that money can be tight.

The above observations are not criticisms of the Hutch, per se, but of academic/ research institutions in general. Also, this is spoken from someone who was attached to a lab (on the academic side of things), so if you're a part of Center IT or HDC (or other ""business-like"" groups, you may have a different experience).","Make it more clear how one might build a career from *every* position, and **train** managers/ PIs to provide mentorship/ career building guidance to their employees.",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

I had an experience with upper management who harasses, mistreats, disrespects and manipulates the younger employees which caused an extremely toxic work environment. Although others are aware of the behavior, no action takes place to fix the toxicity in the culture at Fred Hutch. It is unfortunate that the Human Resources department is divided into two groups known as “old HR” and “new HR”. No employees within the HR department are on the same page and what is most disappointing, is that policies regarding sexual harassment are interpreted differently across the board. Employees without higher status, such as tenure or a disability, have no chance of being heard, even when they are in the right. The Fred Hutch harassment policy is not an important factor when the person abusing the policy is upper management.

Very friendly work community, with a diverse set of talent, both scientific and technical. The Center still conducts world-class research.

Despite taking my star rating down a peg from a couple years ago, I still would recommend the Center to job-seekers. Although the list of ""Cons"" below is quite lengthy relative to the ""Pros,"" hardly any of them apply to me or my position in particular. I enjoy my position, and the Center too, for the most part, but am aware that my situation may in some instances be the exception.","These have more to do with how the Center is managed as a whole, rather than day-to-day work experiences, with a couple of exceptions.

Annual raises aren't what they used to be. When they are provided (usually less than 3%/year), they are often lost to increases in insurance premiums, cost hikes in the cafeteria (more on that later), and other employee-borne costs.

Given the current funding crisis (due to NIH cuts and sequestration), the Center is perpetually on the brink of money starvation. During these times, Center leadership will often make some foolhardy fiscal choices, such as building a flashy skybridge across Eastlake while simultaneously conducting layoffs or cutting funding to vital research programs. The Center has stepped-up its fundraising efforts and, much to my chagrin, has undertaken the practice of continually pestering its own employees to donate through payroll deduction; this practice has left a very bad taste in the mouths of many here, including some at senior levels. In a way, may of us already donate the opportunity cost of a better compensation package elsewhere to the Center's noble research causes.

The Center in recent years has also ""off-shored"" many campus services and amenities. Most notably, food service has been contracted out to an overpriced, out-of-town outfit. Lunch used to cost $5, now it's closer to $10 for less quality, smaller portions, and bad attitudes (undoubtedly the fault of inept food services management). Many of the employees are ex-Hutch food services staff, who I feel were ripped off in this transaction. The cafes are a sad place.

Finally, and very importantly, your mileage at the Center will vary greatly depending on your principal investigator. The Center is a community of much smaller research groups. Most of the scientists here are great, but a handful verge on sociopathy. Be sure to ask very pointed questions during your interview, and try to ""feel out"" other members of the staff to see whether they're happy. Scientists here have carte blanche (HR policy, nor labor laws, nor sometimes even hard reality, can touch them), and can practically get away with anything, and Center human resources is entirely useless when it comes to resolving workplace issues, so it is of crucial importance to figure out whether a particular position is a good match.

Final note, the Center often advertises positions that are actually based at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), its clinical partner. Do yourself a favor and steer a wide path around that place.","Get the fiscal house in order. Prioritize research and faculty/staff over silly ""pet"" projects.

They hired someone else but 6 months later, came back asking for another interivew so I did and got the job in thier Statistical Research Center. My manager would tell me to get to know all the software apps he had developed, yet wouldn't give me access codes so I would fail. He enjoyed telling me I was ""stupid"" every day. I have a masters degree and an amazing resume and am not stupid.

When I appealed to other colleagues, they appeared to be afraid of him. He would tell us (3 person team) which way our chairs were supposed to face when we walked out of the office. Even though Fred Hutch has a huge assortment of classes, I was denied attending any, ever, althoug I was FTE. When interviewed (and this was twice) I stated I did NOT do software dev, and the then manager assured me that since he and our colleague were devs, I would never have to do it. When I walked out, I had 6 software dev assignements. I even hired a tutor but software dev was nowhere to be found in the job description. NONE.

When I quit, upper management (no one is there anylonger, all fired) intstructed met to take my meticulous documentation to the hilarious Fred Hutch HR. I called and emaild for 7 business days before I realized they had no intention of ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, getting back. I brought a member of Seattle's local TV consumer protection team with me to collect my things. This manager has since been fired.

In the spirit of scientific and creative curiosity, not only is the mission reason enough to the work at the Hutch, but the openness about everything from the science to the administration to the parking situation is extremely refreshing at the Hutch. The benefits are great, the campus is ideally located and gorgeous, and amenities are impressive - especially for a non-profit. The pay is comparable to other non-profits in the area and a step above the University of Washington. The staff are more like family than co-workers. The famous saying in Seattle is, ""everyone wants to work at the Gates Foundation."" However, everyone *should* want to work at the Hutch.","Depending on your field, there is not a lot of room for career advancement. Some departments are also a bit too quick to hire an outside consultant to do the work that the highly-skilled employees can and should be doing as well, if not better.",A bit more trust in the people you've hired would be a positive step.,5.0,5.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,
2009-01-17, Research Assistant,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,One of the greatest places to work on your career!,One of the greatest places to work on your career!,0,"This is a terrific place to build a scientific career. The level of scientific achievement and research is world-caliber at this facility. The individual researchers are world experts, publishing in top peer-reviewed journals and trainees from this institute go on to good jobs in research. Access to resources, from journals to facilities for microscopes, specimen processing, data management, etc. is easy and available in-house or you can go elsewhere if you like. There is tremendous support available for career development of trainees, from computer training, to seminars on salary negotiation. In addition, there is Hutch kids for childcare (although I know that there is a waiting list, but that's no different from any other good quality childcare) and great medical benefits, including medical benefits for domestic partners.","Honestly, there aren't really any serious downsides I can think of. At least, not from a research perspective. I can say that if work-life balance is important to you and weighted more towards the 'life' side than the 'work' side (it's fair, everyone gets to decide how they want to live their life), you will not benefit as much from the opportunities here. Obviously, the faculty is pretty serious about their work. That's how they got here. That's hardly a downside if you're trying to advance in your career (and I would count that as a positive, actually).",Way to go (speaking for my area).,5.0,4.5,4.0,4.5,5.0,

Because it is non-profit, there's no incentive to work hard or sharehodlers to answer to so the pace can be relaxed. As a matter of fact, some people seem to be not doing anything productive; I have been here for a few years and I can count a handful of people where honest to goodness I do not know what they do all day. Because it's relaxed and pretty cushy, complacency is common and people don't want to leave. Turnover here is below average therefore career advancement is limited. If you are a person with ambition, look elsewhere or stay for a couple of year for experience /title on your resume and pack your bags for career growth at another organization.

Due to low turnover rate and lack of shareholders to answer to, you have warring factions battling each other for power and control. I see this happening at all departments in the organization; from scientific divisions to IT, alliances are formed and traps are set up to cause failure or embarrass your adversary. I have worked in both the government and private sectors and this place is one of the worst for politics.

If you thrive on politics, this will be a good place for you. I do have to warn you though, it is a contact sport here not for the faint of heart. Don't get me wrong, Fred Hutch do have good people working there but like any other organizations, it's all about your department and manager. Come work here if you want to be part of a noble mission but don't be so naive in thinking that because it's non-profit, all the corporate BS doesn't exist and everyone's working as a team for the greater good. I joined the organization with that kind of ideology which was quickly crushed. I suspect there's some sort of self-selection going on here. People with ambition and dislike politics leave, complacent people and political masters stay.

To succeed here, first join a good alliance, don't make too much waves, do the minimum necessary and all will be ok. As for me? I'm at the tail end of my carrer so the relaxed pace is perfect for me. I'm happy to just go through the motion with a steady paycheck and medical/dental insurance. If you were my children, I'd tell you to consider elsewhere first and only work here as a last resort.","Tone down the politics, I see too many good employees leave because of it. You are left with complacent people adding minimal value to the organization. But then again, management is where the political battles are fought and there will be no truce if it's a mechanism for survival.

Well, I best just keep to myself and take a couple of ""sick days"" to relax in the next few weeks.",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

Some are just coasting for a paycheck but most IT workers, except management, are smart and hard working. It has been awesome to work with them. Work is very flexible and telecommuting is allowed as long as you get your work done on time. The Hutch IT department is constantly learning and deploying new technology and gears so learning opportunity is there.","Although the department says they promote from within, it is definitely not the case. A couple of my coworkers applied for an entry level management job and lost to another outside candidate that used to work at the boss' old company. It's peculiar that almost all the new management hires used to work with the boss.

My coworker and I have been working at the Hutch for 10+ years with glowing reviews each year, not that it automatically qualifies us for the job but we definitely don't feel we are any less qualified than the person hired; we have been told by several people the same thing as well. What's more hurtful was the reason they told us why we didn't get the job, which was complete bullsh**. We are all adults, just tell us the real reason please. I just wish I didn't waste my time going through the vigorous interviewing process which consists of 3 interviews and probably 6+ hours of my time.

The morale is really low right now with critical systems breaking often and blatant cronyism in hiring practice. Scientists are fuming and screaming at us for the bad and broken services we provide. I feel embarrassed to work at IT right now, we are not helping the Hutch's mission by helping the scientists do their jobs. Heck, with systems breaking left and right, we are impeding their research. We are hiring more supervisors and managers, not worker. It's getting to be a big bloated corporation like where the boss came from.",I really don't see any improvement with the current management in charge.
