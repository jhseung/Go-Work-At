They have chosen to only hirer thru personal networks, which means there are very few candidates for each opening and they are no longer getting A players. For a ~100 person outfit, there is way to much politics, back-stabbing and general BS going on.

As they have grown, team members who were individual contributors are now managers, and this is where the most serious problems lie. Being a good manager is very different from contributor, and a result is they have lost over 50% of the pre-sales team over the past 6mos.","Acknowledge and commit to fixing the mid-management problems. The most important aspect of a startup is TRUST and shared values and there are way too many people in multiple orgs who no longer subscribe to the vision and are just biding time waiting for a better opportunity to present itself.

Great office location.
All the ""typical startup"" perks.
The feeling that, if successful, the app could be used in just about every business that has gathered a fair bit of data.","Too many people with too high of an opinion of themselves refusing to listen to ideas that do not match their own plan of attack.
Resistance to changes that can help the team as a whole and instead do whatever they want and then wonder why things are failing and falling down around them.
Engineering spending so much time investing in one tool only to shutter it because someone else thinks they can do better only to shutter that one too because they don't know what they are doing.
Starting to sell Vaporware which may, or may not fit into the product vision.
No product vision because the team that should be doing that is doing anything except for that.

All in all... Sales says that company X needs something to do a deal, then that becomes engineering's next priority item to get out right away no matter how feasible, stable, or fitting to the long term product strategy. Product Management is pretty much not involved at all.","Restructure your teams. Managers of a team do not get to be a manager just because they are the smartest or been there the longest.
Listen to people that you hire that have a knowledge expertise. Someone that is expert in X, saying that in order for X to work well, you need to do Y means if you want X, then do Y. Don't tell them they don't what they are talking about and push them away.
Figure out what Trifacta is supposed to be now, 6 months from now, a year from now, and 5 years from now and execute on that.

The kids made big mess and blamed QA manager and his team for the quality issues, and VPE - for ""doing nothing"". As a result they all got fired.
