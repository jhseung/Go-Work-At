2019-04-15, Business Analyst,"Plano, TX",Current Employee ,This is an Awesome Place to Work,This is an Awesome Place to Work,0,"Office Environment - We have a really nice office here in Plano. It's very updated and located in a great part of town near tons of shops, restaurants, and other businesses. The office in Denver is also very cool and in a great location near Union Station and Rockies' stadium.

Culture - The people here are very friendly and great to work with. Lots of younger people work here and the company has monthly happy hours and birthday celebrations for the employees.

Work Related Tasks - The work is challenging but manageable. I've never been put in a situation where I felt helpless or out of my league. Others are happy to help when you have questions. You also get the opportunity to work with some very large companies and gain exposure to their ways of working.

Compensation - When I first started at Equus, I felt my wage was slightly below average for my background. I was told Equus was a 'Pay for Performance' company, so I figured I would get a raise if I performed at a high level...I did. Equus has been very fair with raises and bonuses during my time here. If you work hard and have a desire to improve, it will more than likely show in your pay.

Benefits - I personally love the 401K plan. It's through Vanguard and has quite a few fund options. It's also nice to have the Roth 401K as an option. Company match is very competitive. PTO and sick allowance are awesome.","Not many cons. The work can be boring, but most of the time it's not bad at all.","As an employee, I appreciate that the company seeks feedback for ways to improve. Please continue to do this and keep making Equus a great place to work!",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

Management works with you when you are going through a rough time.","Sometimes you need to work evenings or early mornings, or buckle down on projects and put in more hours in a week than you would like.

Management cares about their employees, is passionate about client service, and offers a great software product. There have been some growing pains over the five years that I was there, but they are used as learning experiences to make sure it's done better in the future.

Software development and product enhancement are first and foremost and Equus does a great job of maintaining that as the priority. But they are also committed to additional core values that make it a great place to work.

I was new to the software industry and yet always felt that someone had my back. I was pushed and stretched, but never allowed to fail. Personal and career development opportunities are there for the taking.","Fast growth has resulted in some growing pains. For employees that are not comfortable with change, it can be challenging.

Equus truly does hire top-notch, cream of the crop people. Everyone I worked with was very knowledgeable and passionate for what they do. I developed some great relationships and everyone is willing to help and support where needed.

One of Equus' core values is to make it a great place to work. As a former employee, I can truly say the leadership takes this seriously. It is a laid back working environment with many perks. If you work hard and take care of your customers, you are recognized and rewarded.

Definitely a place with a good work/life balance.

I would highly recommend Equus as a place to work for those seeking opportunities there.","It is a small company, so not a lot of career paths, but is growing.

Having 3 locations (London, Denver, Dallas), it truly values each of the employees that work abroad. Having a company size of 100 employees, it uses a creative way to make sure that everyone feels welcome to collaborate amongst each other, even though geographically the employees are in different areas. Leading in the global mobility industry, the company strives to not only set the trend but invite young and new ideas to the industry as well. Having started a College Recruiting campaign, the dynamic and culture of the company is trending towards a younger vibe. The HQ (Denver) has a modern culture and it shows!!",The con would be understanding the global mobility industry itself. It seems as though a handful of people actually know the business aspect rather than knowing both the business aspect as well as the software that we use to manage the process.

With this being said as far as the company goes there is nothing that I would change about my experience, there is not a bad thing that I would say about my time working at Equus.

The company is a leader the industry of Global Mobility for providing fast, innovative, and secure technology for its clients. The support and tools the company provides its employees are second to none. EVERYONE at the company wants its ""A +"" employed talent to succeed. I have never been involved with a company that at any level of my 10 year career that has such qualified, intelligent, and team oriented coworkers. Literally everyone is fantastic at their job, and they go above and beyond for others at the company.

We truly have a family atmosphere. I come into the office with a smile on my face and leave once my day is done completely stress free and it is amazing. They compensate quite well and proactively watch the market to make sure their employees are paid fairly. I get to work with the largest companies in the world and learn everyday.

I could go on and on about how great it is to work here, but I will leave you with this; there is no place better to work, only equal, there is no place that will challenge you more and give you every tool necessary to succeed.

2014-09-08, Client Services,,Former Employee ,Solid Technology Company,Solid Technology Company,0,"Great people who are willing to go the extra mile for their clients and colleagues alike. Equus has superior product and service compared to the competition. Salaries are solid, benefits are just ok, but this is to be expected at a smaller firm like Equus. Business/Revenue growth is steady, but this is not a fast-growth startup niche.

Some opportunity to work from home.","Since global relocation is an industry with an older workforce, the average age at Equus is older than your typical software company. This is not a huge con, but they have hired a lot of people with a relocation background as opposed to a software background. Diversity of backgrounds is somewhat lacking among employees.

There is also some expectation from management (whether middle or upper I'm not sure) that you may need to work extra hours. Thus, the work/life balance here is not always desirable. Overall I believe they are good people with good intentions, but archaic traditional management styles do not translate well to a tech company, especially when you're trying to attract bright young talent.

Growth is steady but unspectacular, as I mentioned. Do not expect a promotion within the first year or two.","We must find a way to attract and keep people with a diversity of backgrounds, and perhaps even racial diversity as well, since I noticed that was lacking. It is also imperative that managers possess experience in technology. A bunch of ex-corporate middle managers are not going to get the job done when the market changes and the competition has an opportunity to capitalize.

My unbiased view of this company:
You get to work in a collaborative and dynamic environment with some very intelligent people
Everyone values your contributions
Remuneration is good
You can carve out your own future as you see fit as the company is relatively flat structured
The company is fast growing which means your contribution has more of an impact
Leadership is inspiring and you get to meet them and voice your opinions","Not many, asno company is perfect. Some areas to address:

As the team is fast growing, effort needs to be made to embed the newbies in the office environment consistently. This really depends on the buddy.
Address the new office layout - seems a little segregated.
Have more transparency over potential earnings/what peers are earning as this will act as a motivator",See above. Continue to foster the Equus family environment as this is what makes you retain employees and sets you out from all the other tech companies out there.

2018-01-31,,,Former Employee ,London office is beyond hell avoid ANY role,London office is beyond hell avoid ANY role,0,"To be honest not much ""Pros"" aside from the nice aesthetics of the office. Wouldn't consider this a pro but they do try and market themselves like other tech companies. Only difference is other technology companies are NOT fake and actually have a family oriented culture.

Honestly. that can’t be said about Equus who last time I counted everyone is either leaving , trying or planning to leave.

The staff turnover for a company like this is astronomical (Equus office is like 21 people in London yet hardly anyone stays after a year). It’s a fake environment and fake family culture.","Overall culture:

Well it’s a very magnolia atmosphere not referencing the paint (equality hasn't reached this office yet).

There is no salary structure although friendship with certain management results in a better pay structure compared to your colleagues doing the same thing (or less to be honest).

The culture is very two faced and fake you will be praised by clients and other people you are in contact with and never acknowledged by your management.

If you like no praise and management taking credit this is the place for you! If you like to actually work hard, then expect to be chastised for not achieving more! Sounds good so far? Then this is the place for you!

Human Resources- There is no HR department, actually correction HR consists of senior management direction from the USA mainly (who have no actual knowledge in regards to UK environment) I’m actually thinking that UK employment law doesn’t apply at this company (clearly they think that they are exempt).

Workload - if you appreciate a social life don’t apply you are expected to work late and start early with no appreciation. Dare you even try to leave by 7pm, you would be the talk of the office. Management seems to offload work to their junior counterparts. Yet they take all credit. If you are looking for career progression and an actual career look elsewhere.

SINCERELY - AVOID: at all costs, personally I would rather be punished for the rest of my life from 9.00am to 5.30pm everyday with the task of watching paint dry then work for this literal definition of hell on earth again.","Stop with the favouritism and actually acknowledge your employees worth (thats a start).

Stop with treating one individual with one set of rules and others with different rules. You have the potential to be a good employer once you take your american opinions out of UK law and legislation.

Recommendation for you becoming better employers:

STOP with the favoritism, you aren't kidding anyone (its actual company standard to only show appreciation to those with the loudest voice, hence A player hiring strategy).

Read up on equal opportunity laws within the UK!

Sincerely consider hiring a HR person in the UK (maybe negative reviews wouldn't happen so often, if you did, its called supporting employees, search that online).

ADVICE:

Take advice from any employer within the universe the actual standard is that they choose to develop employees rather than take their blood, sweat and tears from their employees. You are NOT a cult so don’t act like one!",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The Denver office might be fun, but we received the sudden 'xyz is no longer a member of staff here' from the Denver office just as frequently as we got it in our own.","No care for work/life balance at all. If you work to your contracted hours you will be accused of not working hard enough. People routinely stay 7-8pm at night, and stay later on Fridays for checkouts.

Duplicitous and callous management. They will tell you that you are performing admirably throughout your time there, then suddenly dismiss staff with no apparent reason given. We were always completely shocked when someone was dismissed suddenly.

There is no disciplinary process in place, even though it is stated that you are entitled to receive formal warnings in case of any failures in performing your duties in your contract, this is NOT followed through even past probation. Until you hit the 2 year mark (as per the law) you will be easily expendable without a second thought.

Staff seem to live in constant cycle of worry, stress and fear over their status, workload and employment prospects. Staff have actually taken unpaid leave due to stress.

Nobody speaks casually in the office, it is a silent culture and there is little to no socialising generally. I routinely saw crying managers, heard arguments from conference rooms and staff had shouting matches at each other across the office over trivial, petty matters. Nobody seems to like each other, bar a select few.

High turnover of staff. In a space of about 6 months, we lost 7 people. This was in an office of less than 25 people.

Business analysts are particularly miserable and fearful, especially the grads.","Your HR policies are demented, outdated, and lack employment protection rights. Take your US way of hiring out of the UK office.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
