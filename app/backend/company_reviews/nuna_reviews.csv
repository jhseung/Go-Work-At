2019-02-18, Senior Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,Good mission which attracts great people,,0,"The thing that convinced me to join Nuna in the first place was the people that work there. Nuna has a great mission to fix the US healthcare system which attracts the right kind of people: talented, genuine and mission-driven people.",Changing things in healthcare is slow and the impact of your work is not always obvious or immediate.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,
2018-11-07, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Amazing company,More than a year,0,"This is a truly amazing company, I have interviewed at several companies in healthcare from EHRs to mental health platforms. What I have seen is that the EHR companies in the Bay Area are full of hype, their product is buggy and lacking features and they have extremely low penetration in the market and lack of actual innovation and thus sales heavy. Nuna is truly revolutionzing healthcare and is well funded.","regardless of how much you get paid, who would not like more pay",Keep it up. I love this company and what is stands for,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-07-18,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Interesting Work with Wonderful People,More than a year,0,"Nuna is a mission-driven company trying to make the US healthcare space a better place through data analytics that benefit the actual patients receiving healthcare, not just the employer, payer or provider. Knowing this makes it very easy to get out of bed in the morning. Employees and management are caring and good listeners. There is an emphasis on being sensitive to each others' needs and to constructive problem solving and open communication. Certain new products have the possibility of being truly disruptive and profitable in the marketplace.","The company is lacking some basics: a product lifecycle that provides a common baseline and vocabulary for communicating status; an emphasis on budget and cost awareness that is driven down to all levels of the organization; for new products and services, a crisp vision of how they will be packaged, licensed, and sold.","Would love to see some real business and sales people in the mix, which right now leans heavily towards engineers and data scientists.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-07-22,,,Former Employee ,"Great team members and mission, but needs a leadership re-haul",,0,"Overall, if you're self-directed and looking to learn within your respective domain alongside incredibly smart and dedicated team members, Nuna is a wonderful place. If you need a plan and direction, this will be a tough place to strive as you often have to create your own order. The company offers great perks and flexibility for both remote and on-site employees. If you just keep yourself focused on your task this is a great place with really kind team members. The company has a ton of potential, but needs stronger management to reach that potential. If you're applying for a management role, know that it'll be a hard task, but you can make a difference. If you're applying as an individual contributor, you will definitely be working on projects with impact.

- The mission of changing how healthcare decisions are made on a large scale, especially on the government side, is what inspired me to come to work every day.
- Process improvements we continue to influence with gov't clients is equal parts challenging and rewarding. Knowing that we're improving how the gov't functions, not just with our products but also with our culture/process is motivational.
- Recruiting process is great and always improving to ensure we hire the best person for the job.
- Very accommodating culture for remote employees.
- Great perks including lunch, health, fitness, commuter, etc.
- Team members are kind, helpful, and compassionate, making for a very respectful work environment.","Like many companies transitioning from small to mid-size, Nuna is going through growing pains and would benefit from a leadership team with more experience to help the company scale. This shouldn't deter anyone from joining the team, as I mentioned under the pros section, if you stay focused on your job, it's great. But if you're in a position to be mixed in with internal decision-making or promotion processes, it can be frustrating and here's why:

- The lack of talent management can lead to frustration and retention issues. If leadership or senior team members had more experience managing people, this would solve itself.
- Promotions tend to be perception-based rather than data-based because the senior leadership team makes the final decision and they're not involved with the work on a day-to-day basis. It's an environment where those working hard are too busy to play politics, and those not working as hard are busy marketing themselves. This leads to teams being led by people who are interested in advancing themselves and not the team.
- There's a lot of conversation around being aware of unconscious bias, but leadership doesn't do a good job of reflecting on whether it's happening and trying to eliminate it. There have been multiple cases where male employees are moved up based on ""available and interested"" or even ""bored flight risk"" and everyone is instructed to play fair and give them a chance to succeed. Whereas female employees, even when available and interested, are made to jump through arbitrary hoops such as internal interviews, multiple approvals, etc., or just flat out told they don't have the skills for the job. It's subtle, but when it happens over and over again, it's hard to ignore the data.
- It's a very engineering-leaning organization; having your voice heard over an engineer's can be a challenge.
- Leadership team will often belittle the CEO, signaling a not-so-healthy dynamic within that group.","- Don't silence disagreement, instead welcome it, before making decisions you don't have day-to-day context for.
- Trust that everyone is working towards the same goal and invite the people with the right insights to the table, not just your trusted cohort who doesn't interact with the client or the project team daily.
- Take feedback seriously and not personally. It's hard to give feedback when it causes more drama than action.
- Ensure internal moves are openly advertised and fair for all parties interested. When deciding who to backfill a position with, ensure that the decision is healthy for the team's growth, not just that individual's.
- Ask for help from the people on the ground doing the work. Lean on these people and promote from within before hiring externally.",3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,2.0

They also have a real-world understanding of the challenges ahead, with strong connections to government policy and leaders across the industry.
- Team has a unique blend of talented engineers, data scientists, product managers, health policy folks, project managers, designers, researchers, and more.

- You feel like you’re working on an important problem at a company that has a real chance of making a difference.",- Driving healthcare system change is not for the faint of heart :) It is a complex environment with a lot of idiosyncrasies.

2018-03-30,,,Current Employee ,Great place to grow as a Data Scientist and feel passionate about what you are doing,,0,"- If you are passionate about making healthcare better for everyone, you should come to Nuna. This is what Nuna cares about and works towards as a company.
- Nuna has some of the smartest people I have met, and everyday I learn something new from working with these people. There are a broad spectrum of data science problems to think about and solve.
- People I met at Nuna are incredibly kind to each other, and have lots of respect for diversity.
- Management at Nuna cares about creating better, more positive team culture and the career growth of individual team members. There are greater opportunities to advance career compared to a larger company.
- The senior management is transparent to the employees about outlook, goals, and strategic directions of the company.","- The data and engineering infrastructure is being improved, but currently it is still not as stable and smooth as it is compared to a more established company (which is expected for a start-up). This sometimes leads to inefficiency in the work of other parts of the company, such as Data Science, but on the bright side, also creates lots of opportunities for people who are interested and expert in improving them!","Keep doing what you are doing, and create more opportunities for people to grow both technically and professionally.",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,

Nuna has done some really impactful work in the healthcare space, and new business opportunities in the pipeline are exciting.","Healthcare is a very conservative space and what Nuna has been doing is challenging. Because of that, Nuna is still exploring its best business strategy and core products in the long run, so it appears to be less focused as it ideally should be.

Whether that is in the area of how we grow and support our employees, the kinds of engineering we do, or the opportunities we pursue. We are growing fast, and there is a lot of opportunity here for some great technical leaders.","We are disrupting a change-averse, slow-moving industry that is in extreme uncertainty as it moves to value based care. There are very few right answers, and all the data is rough at best, and poor at worst. We have an immense challenge before us to acquire, clean, and analyze this data at scale and derive useful, accurate insights from it. The challenge for us that we will always continue to face is how to chart our course and stay on it amid the turbulent waters all around us.

2018-02-16, Data Science,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,I can't imagine a better place to be a Data Scientist,More than a year,0,"There is a spectrum of Data Science work in the tech industry, from ""do A/B tests to help optimize add revenue for an existing product"" to ""design, research, and build new innovative products that use cutting edge Data Science methods to solve problems for clients."" Nuna is very far towards the latter end of that spectrum. The team of data scientists currently assembled is nothing short of brilliant, and working with them has been the greatest learning experience of my professional life. Additionally, the company is very mission-focused, and cares about solving a real world problem that affects millions of people: the flow of information and incentives in our healthcare system is broken. Bonus for an incredibly collegial culture -- the people here are great friends in addition to being great colleagues.","If you don't think you can handle being somewhat self-directed, this probably isn't the place for you. We expect people to take ownership over their work and to suggest new directions and innovations.

-A serious emphasis on company culture that is backed up by the leadership team.","-We're still a startup, and we are still young. If you are coming from a place with a lot of structure, there can be some culture shock when you join. You need to be self-motivated because there is no hand-holding here.
-The flip side of having a lot of smart people who are happy to help out - sometimes you have multiple people trying to do the same things, resulting in redundant work or churn.

Some of the people I met at Nuna are some of my best friends.,"The entire time I was there, there never seemed to be a cohesive vision that could translate into short term and mid term goals. If it ever seemed like any goals were established they were often quickly forgotten and cast aside for something new.
