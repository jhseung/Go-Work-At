2019-03-29, Software Engineer,"Denver, CO",Current Employee ,Meh,Meh,0,The location downtown is decent.,"It seems that there's effectively a system of classism amongst developers here. A few developers get decent equipment from one brand. Everyone else gets low quality laptops and monitors from another. The team you're on will dictate whether you're properly equipped to do your job or not. It's a blatant system of inequality that will set you up for frustration at the very least.

There were retention problems which managers openly admitted in the past. What this really means is that there are few colleagues who are well qualified or motivated still here. You'll be working with leftovers or a few developers in positions of power or higher status for the most part.

It seems to be process heavy. You'll knowingly be doing work that serves no purpose or will be replaced soon after. It's an exercise in insanity.

Not at all a meritocracy.

It seems to me that they practice waterfall here in all but title. Yes there are sprints. Yes there are scrum masters and various Agile ceremonies. But. Everything is planned and committed to 12 weeks in advance. Meetings are frequent and feedback is ignored. It's a ""process over people"" society here.

From what I've heard and seen, it seems that generally a promotion will not be offered unless someone with a higher title quits or you put in your notice yourself. There have been a few exceptions. Note the word ""few"".

Too many other problems to list.

Limited growth opportunity. Non-existent career advancement opportunity.","Start by leveling the classism you've created. Give everyone the same and decent equipment.
Stop conducting processes and ceremonies for the sake of appearances. You've become complacent and comfortable with mediocrity. Give more to your developers and expect more.",3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Seems like people get cheap PCs or used macs. WiFi cuts in and out all day, making it difficult to get work done. There could be much more flexibility in remote work.","Please invest in solid working equipment for your employees and get reliable WiFi. We depend on it.

Once you get 6 months to a year of experience, move on to a company that might actually care about your professional growth.","Too many to mention, but the big ones include low compensation, no direction from management, and constant moving goal posts.

Office is nice.","Promotions only happen once a year in April, and they are very rare. Vertafore is not interested in retaining employees. My manager once told me that I should try working 9.5 hour days if I want a chance of ever getting promoted.
