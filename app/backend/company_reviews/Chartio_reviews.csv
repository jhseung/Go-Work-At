2019-01-01,,,Former Employee ,Wouldn't suggest -,Wouldn't suggest -,0,"Convenient San Francisco location, free lunch daily, unlimited PTO, great product potential. A lot of effort/resources is put into building 'culture'.","- The CEO/Exec team has too much misguided confidence in their own understanding of the market. Has difficulty navigating the very competitive market/landscape. The whole company has really struggled against competotors. Has not prioritized any real Product Marketing or market research.
- Heavy confirmation bias amongst exec team. Only recognizing outcomes that confirm personal opinions has hindered productive conversations and impactful decision making. There was a perception amongst the company that the exec team will push out anyone who challenges them (had concerns about their ability to maintain healthy conflict).
- Not very open minded. Unwilling to hear alternate approaches or creatively collaborating to solve the challenges ahead. Also quick to point a finger or blame another.
- Very male dominating culture. However, a female VP of People has been added so hopefully this will change!","Encourage more diverse perspectives and substantiate various approaches based on merit (not opinions). Put egos aside and impartially navigate the decisions ahead. Also, take responsibility and own your piece when outcomes aren't optimal. Don't be afraid to truly have productive/hard conversations.",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0

2017-09-19,,,Current Employee ,Exciting mission and great team,Exciting mission and great team,0,"Chartio has been a good experience thus far. The company is fairly small, with ~35 employees which I personally like. It’s large enough to have some specialization in sales, marketing, customer success and engineering but not so large that those teams don’t collaborate. I’ve really enjoyed working with people across the entire organization thus far.

The product itself is also exciting. It’s fun to be in the business intelligence / data analytics market. Chartio’s roadmap and vision are compelling to me personally, as I’ve seen numerous past companies struggle to use their data effectively.",There has been a decent amount of change in some of the departments recently. Those departments are still finding their equilibrium but over the past couple months things seem to be stabilizing.,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,

Strong product with the potential to make a big difference in the market. The CEO does not follow your typical Silicon Valley arrogant stereotype. He is a genuinely nice person who cares about the people who work for him, but can also make difficult decisions to move the organization forward. The new leadership team has a lot of passion and experience to take the company to the next level and the team is already having a positive impact on culture. Do not shy away from the company due to some of the vocal negativity of disgruntled former employees.","Recent (and overdue) changes in the leadership team have resulted in a few disgruntled employees and reviews, but the company is already seeing the positive effects of these changes.",Stay true to the vision and keep the mission-driven culture push going.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

The Marketing team is the best of the best. I have the pleasure of working with some of the most motivated, intelligent, and engaged team members that anyone could ask for.
Chartio gives us free lunch everyday. (amazing food!)
New opportunities for continued growth, with new positions opening up at an increasing pace.
Great activities out of the office! For example: Soccer games! It is a fantastic way to get some exercise while having fun with the entire team!","If you are not ready for a new challenge, this may not be the place for you.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Note to self, take more advantage of that unlimited vacation!","One huge con. The CEO. He has absolutely no business being in charge of a lemonade stand and yet here he finds himself at the head of a company. He has no idea what to do and in fact, rather than using his own product to analyze the market opportunity he's continued to drive towards his outdated and misguided vision. His big concern seem to be if anyone likes him or not. He does internal NPS only to find out no one would recommend this place to their friends. If you don't like him you apparently get fired. The sad truth is based on that qualification he probably needs to fire 90% of us. The market Chartio is in is far too competitive to have someone with such a fragile ego, no leadership skills nor creative ideas on where to go next. The rest of the negative reviews here are spot on as well.","Since you fancy yourself and engineer, build a time machine and go back a couple of years and sell the company and go start an artist commune or a book club. Otherwise, fire yourself and quit screwing up so many careers.",1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

If you are a junior employee and you really need experience to pad your resume, you might find what you're looking for here.","The CEO kind of poisons the workplace. Opinion seems to be unanimously against him. If you like petty drama, come work here.",The CEO should just stop.,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
2017-07-20,,,Current Employee ,A breeding ground for mediocrity,A breeding ground for mediocrity,0,"The product was built by some talented people, and fortunately most of them had the sense to jump ship before they had to watch their work crumble and die.","Chartio suffers from having one of those CEOs who has no idea what he's doing but needs constant affirmation and can't tolerate criticism or disagreements. Every executive who's done anything other than constantly tell him how great he is (including doing their actual job) has gotten fired, even if they were well-liked by everyone who reported to them. This has caused an atmosphere of distrust and apathy, as well as a steady deterioration of the company's effectiveness as good ideas are shot down and complacency/mediocrity are rewarded.

If you want to get paid to stroke a narcissist's ego all day, this is the place for you*. If you want to do actual work without feeling like you're running headfirst into a brick wall, look elsewhere.

* Note that you'll have much better luck at this if you're white and male.",,1.0,,,,,
