2018-12-18, Software Developer,"Oakland, CA",Current Employee ,Great dev team and culture,More than a year,0,"The autonomy and resources afforded you mean you learn a lot about many different parts of the stack quickly. We don't place hard deadlines on features so you have the ability to iterate and revise until you feel good about deploying. Senior devs are very knowledgeable and the CEO is a developer so decisions are always made with engineering in mind.
For career trajectory, this is a great place if you want to work on many different parts of the site/stack and always want coding to be part of your job.","Lack of hard structure might be a downside for some. Tooling around testing, building, deployment, bugs, and logging are all very lacking and take up a lot of dev time.
If you have management aspirations, might not be the place for you. This may change as the team continues to grow.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
2018-12-11, Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,Great workplace,More than a year,0,"They focus heavily on long-term team-building and product quality. They clearly want happy long-term employees, not short-term squeezed ones. Employee retention is high in general, and exceptionally high in the engineering department. The company is an ""up and comer"" with ambitious prospects in the legal space, and a decent chance of achieving them. It is a startup with venture capital, but probably stabler than most because revenue is also solid.

Software engineers get a lot of autonomy and ownership of their work. You generally have individual engineering ownership of a product feature. There are no specializations (e.g. front-end, back-end, java, etc.) - so you are generally responsible for a feature end-to-end -- which is great for skill development. There is usually no micromanagement; you often have a couple weeks or more between any kind of meetings with management. Feedback is usually astute and useful. It's a genuinely supportive environment without any real ""company drama"" that I'm aware of. From what I've seen, everyone is good at what they do, and management considers their job to be providing support, not cracking a whip.","This wouldn't be a good fit for everyone. The same development model that gives us a lot of autonomy and ownership of our projects also means there is a lack of structure. If you can handle that, your skills can really shine, but you need more than engineering skill. You need project management skills to provide your own daily structure, to plan out your own feature, to setup meetings with anyone you need for background knowledge and feedback. You need to take initiative to acquire missing information you haven't always been provided. Everyone is always nice and supportive when you ask for these kinds of things-- but you usually have to ask. You often play a central role in defining and/or refining your own feature-spec; you aren't just handed a polished spec document. There is a mentor period to ramp you up, and there are a growing number of processes written up (which you can help with). But if you can't pick up these sorts of softer skills, you might get frustrated and overwhelmed, even if you are a great engineer.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2018-08-28,,,Current Employee ,Exceptional Product and Amazing Company Culture,,0,"I have worked at Everlaw for one year and have immensely enjoyed my experience here so far. The people here are fantastic to work with there is a culture of collaboration and transparency that makes coming to work every day something I look forward to. The product is also top-class and our development team is consistently releasing new features to a market that is in desperate need of innovation.

Another plus is that Everlaw has a leadership team that takes the time to build the company the right way. We're growing quickly and changes are hapenning at a rapid rate but major decisions and the reasoning behind them are always shared across the company. It feels to me like individual feedback and input are both welcomed and appreciated.

Everyone gets along well and the culture is fun and encourages learning. There is support if you need it but employees are granted a lot of autonomy. The work itself is interesting and challenging, and the pressure is to create robust and well thought out solutions rather than getting things out the door quickly.","As the company has grown quickly the culture has suffered a little bit. There are fewer opportunities to take breaks with other employees at work which was a central part of the culture.
