They compensate overtime on top of salary. Good 401k plan (Fidelity).","Where to begin... well first off, this is a billion dollar company, and yet when you walk into some of the buildings, you would think the profit margin is only in the couple thousands. The factory I work in is all a closed area.. and it’s been the same building probably since the 50’s (previously Howard Hughes)... we make missiles inside that individually are sold for over a MILLION dollars, and yet... the office space? Cubes are tinted yellow from the oldness... the carpet floors are turning black and are starting to look like a parking lot... don’t bother wiping your desk.... there will be dust balls and debris all over it in another week... the “break areas” yeah... dieting is great, as soon as you open the microwave you lose your appetite... it’s filthy. The bathrooms.. I’ve seen better facilities at rest stops.. pretty embarrassing. I’ve seen roaches on the factory floor... and book shelves in office areas that when you lift something off you get hit in the face with dust. Office furniture is all hand me downs... all mismatched.. my back problems have gotten worse and worse especially when they made us work 12 hr shifts. Want an ergo desk? Yeah.... will probably take a month or so for the 1 ergo evaluator to get to it, all you’ll get is a thing that lifts your computer so you can stand or sit... the desk where I sit has an adjustable keyboard section that’s broken... I never pull it out because when I did the mouse pad that swings from below it was filthy. It’s seriously so discouraging walking into this factory and office area everyday... it is down right depressing. An office area should be nice and well kept.. since you spend so much time here, the break room areas are gross, and the best part is.. not Iike you can go outside the campus for lunch... nothing great nearby, and getting thru the security gates and getting parking takes forever.. so hope you can spare 2 hours or more... even the fast food places are a drive. It is in the absolute worse/high crime rate area of South Tucson. Vending machines are always broken... nothing healthy just junk.. if you work off shifts, you better bring your lunch, or prepare to visit a vending machine for junk or just not eat at all... no options to be able to buy food here after the normal lunch hour.
I’ve been “voluntold” that I would support off shifts, and have been put on a weekend coverage rotation... so all that you hear about “work life balance”? Yeah not true especially if you hold multiple clearances... they are having a hard time getting people cleared it’s back logged... so when one person leaves, their work gets thrown onto someone else and the same people that have been getting away with not doing anything all day keep doing the same and don’t feel bad about it. Say you take on all this extra work load.... think maybe you will score some points with your manager and get noticed by directors, maybe lead to a job promotion... think again. Your manager will get all the glory, all the bonuses, they will move up and your still doing the same thing. Want to take some PTO? Good luck if you can’t find someone to cover for you... otherwise it won’t get approved. Don’t even bother asking for time off if you support the off shifts...

The health insurance (united healthcare) is awful, so expensive, you still pay co-pays, high deductibles while a bunch gets taken out of your check every 2 weeks.","Stop taking your $20k bonuses every quarter, and invest in the facilities that ALL your employees utilize. Especially when your off enjoying your off Friday, weekends, and PTO while everyone below you has to/is expected to work around the clock and put in overtime, come in on weekends... to some of the worst facilities that are downright depressing to work in. Employees are depressed, unmotivated, and exhausted. You are losing your top talent because of this, and because they are not being given challenging work... being listened to and respected, and helping out when they need time off. You will start to feel the hurt when these young engineers all start leaving for better facilities, better work... then no one will be left to support your 24/7 operations.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

I will say Raytheon delivers excellent products across the board and employs some of the most brilliant engineers in the industry.

The only thing that matters is the bottom line- not the customer, and not you. This is not a meritocracy-if you are a high achiever, you will be much more valued and much happier somewhere else. This is not for innovative thinkers- the company is completely process driven. Make no mistake, as an employee here you are now expendable- your level or performance doesn't matter. It's so sad to see what it has become. The company used to be led by the P&L businesses who care about people, and developing and retaining talent. Now the company is completely controlled by Corporate HR and Finance. People are just an expense line on a balance sheet that needs to be reduced. Opportunities for advancement, and/or incentives, for myself and my team, that used to make the company so great are no longer available. The culture around travel, or anything involving expenses (i.e. relocating) is also now a nightmare- arguably the worst in the industry, which is well-known.

Senior leadership was pretty bad. There were inter-office politics wherein desirable work went to certain office sites first, and the ugly duckling sites got the leftovers. Upper management contributed to this problem, and lower management was unwilling or unable to address it. Work was often promised but never arrived. Getting equipment took too long.

Extremely short sighted and it is now catching up. Many of the managers are not software engineers and as a result don't know how to manage software projects nor check on their team if they are satisfied. Little advancement unless you are lucky to find the right manager who knows how to be a champion. Otherwise many will just shrug and say they can't help.

They are currently ramping down ie laying people off so ALL the contractors are about to lose their next year and many have already migrated off to Northrup or Lockheed. Currently moving all software folks to testing as that is the only priority from now on. Not many software development work is available as management have not been working on securing contracts nor have been placing capable employees into the security clearance process.

If you are a new hire/graduate from school, I am warning you right now to be asking detailed questions during the interview if you are applying for this job. They won't have a lot of SW work left and if there are any then they will most likely only assign it to the more senior people as it is a rare commodity. They will say they have plenty of work but I promise you that they dont as there is a HUGE communication problem and no one knows any of the agenda anymore.

Not communicative. People are pushing/committing bad code that isn't reviewed and breaking things. Managers themselves think certain work/modules need to be done even though that is not the reality.","Work on communication on all levels and make sure everyone is on the same page. Check on your employees more and try to advocate them better in the performance reviews. You have hired some of hte cheapest but most capable people in the industry and are now leaving due to the dissatisfaction. Start asking questions on why we are losing so many senior engineers (5+ years) before it happens. STOP HIRING SWE and lying to them saying you have work when you don't (could be symptom of bad communication between upper management).

- Job Security. In my years here I haven't seen people get laid off due to downsizing. Typically the company just goes into hiring freezes rather than cutting current employees. Defense Industry remains stable even in midst of recessions usually.
- 9/80 schedule depending on your manager. Get every other Friday off. It's a nice perk to have if you need to run errands and don't want to take the PTO to do so
- If you're in the SCLDP, it is very good for networking amongst different business units, learning the business, and having a diverse supply chain background within the company.","- The red tape can be mind-numbing at times and make things EXTREMELY slow. Defense procurement specifically is so heavily regulated by the FAR/DFAR that it takes some time for things to happen. Some of this is the company's fault too, though as they often implement too strict of guidelines to make sure they adhere to the FAR.
- Below Industry Avg Salary. UNDERGRADUATE LDPs: If you are in the LDP program as an undergraduate, you will make half the salary of the graduate LDPs with MBAs but still potentially do the same level/complexity of work. This was the case for me and it was extremely debilitating. Your salary increase each year based on performance is extremely limited. I would expect 2-3% to be the norm, and 5% to be the max each year (it's hard to set yourself up for success when you're placed in a role that has limited opportunities to shine). Once you roll off the program, don't expect a huge salary bump, expect nothing more than 5%.

Retaliatory actions occur if one gets in the way of schedule and cost of a product even when it concerns the quality of the product.

Below average pay (5-10% lower than industry average) and extremely low yearly raises and promotional salary increases, barely matches COL increase or inflation. HR is NOT your friend as they will intensely fight (even to the point of deception) to save the company money. Company also values length of employment over abilities, skills, and experience.
Corporate and Upper Management express little interest in promoting within the company, however continues to gripe over retention and recruitment, complaining about the costs in the same breath.
Record profits each year but increasing financial cuts across the board.

Over abundance of red tape, process, bureaucracy and politics hindering innovation and adding little if no value.

Section managers do not have the time/budget to establish a relationship with their employees and due to the matrix organization often don't have helpful insight to the employees progress or accomplishments. This hinders advancement and growth.

R6S methodology is an overall waste and is a proven failed all-in-one solution applied to every problem. National 6S certifications are ignored and R6S certifications and mandatory causing more cost than savings.

Outside experience is ignored and deemed inferior and less valued compared to Raytheon experience.

Extensive travel by the employee is not recognized or valued, in addition travel per diem is 'robbed' from employees as it is not given like some companies, MUST use business card for all purchase, no travel rewards. Some management expect actual air travel time to be on personal time, not business time, more ethical violations.
