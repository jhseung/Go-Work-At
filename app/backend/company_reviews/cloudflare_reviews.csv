2019-03-20,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Delighted to be Here,Less than a year,0,"While going through the recruitment process, I was concerned by a few of the postings I read on Glassdoor, specifically about the CEO, and how he engages with employees. I reached out to a good friend who works at Cloudflare, and they took the time to go through the negative reviews and share their perspective with me. That conversation helped alleviate some concerns, still, I feared that after joining things might take a turn for the worse.

My concerns went away my first week during orientation. Upon hearing the CEO speak to our onboarding cohort it became evident he's a passionate, intelligent, caring, and thoughtful leader. Throughout the week it also became clear that Cloudflare is full of equally passionate, intelligent, caring, and thoughtful individuals.

Every day I come into the office, excited for the work I'm doing, and for the people I have the privilege of doing it with. I have regular experiences (daily) which validate my decision to work here. Cloudflare is AMAZING and the people who work here are genuinely good human beings — intelligent, capable, and inspiring — and a delight to work with. I couldn't be happier!","Like many fast growing companies we have our growing pains. I don't know that I've got enough information to diagnose what the biggest challenges are.

Definitely appeals to mid-sized companies. Mission of creating a better internet resonates with techies. Office is located by ballpark close to several other well known startups and tech companies.,"Senior management (and most levels of management for that matter) often makes decisions without being transparent with other managers or employees. Very politically charged environment where you have to constantly watch your back and navigate the political landscape daily. Tension between departments and within departments regularly which can be exhausting.

I would not trust my career and development here. Anyone joining should take it for what it is worth...a unicorn name on the resume, with little long term attraction...most good talent leaves the company within 2 years because of the very cheap compensation and horrible culture.

HR team is powerless and focuses on how to get PR for the company rather than solving the real day to day problems. Company likes to hire ""yes"" people and this includes HR.","Bring in new people outside the company who know what it takes to scale a company successfully from both a business and cultural standpoint.

Unique mission
Still a lot of smart people
Amazing core product","You're a second-class citizen whose day-to-day experience will mostly depend on the maturity of your team and the capability of your manager - both vary wildly between micro- and absentee management. Even with a great team, the best employees tend to put in 2 years and leave, and only a handful stay past the 4 year mark. People are never prioritized over the increasingly unfocused mission of re-inventing the Internet.

The management layer is a dangerous mix of inexperienced and underpowered. Many are overly concerned with how they are perceived by their bosses due to the cult of personality at the very top. Many are powerless as a lot of key day-to-day decisions are still filtered through the executive team. Headcount, compensation, and even final interviews still flow through the top. So, even a solid manager requires final approval from above them for any decision that really matters.

This means many teams are understaffed and employees find themselves overworked and underpaid. Problems tend to get hidden instead of surfaced, become technical debt and just pile up until things start breaking. The company very accurately ""lurches from one incident to another"" as one reviewer put it, and the employees are the ones that have to clean up each and every mess.","Do right by your employees today so it'll be easier to do right by your shareholders in the future.

2018-10-15, Full Stack Engineer,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Engineer,More than a year,0,"Engineering is world class. I don't know how Cloudflare manages at under a 1k of employees to bring together so many brilliant, creative minds.

There are a variety of teams that all have different pros and cons. You can be fluid in your role if you are a go-getter that likes making an impact. In every team, your job is what you make it and there is a ton of room to grow and reach out beyond the scope of your role or even your team.

Austin office is isolated in terms of freedom of creativity and informed risk-taking, yet integrated with the rest of the company in terms of engineering practices and company goals.","The company is at a stage where certain teams are being corporatized. Process in some teams takes up more effort than deliver value, which I believe is typical at this stage in a company. Good news is, Austin office and product strategy particularly are protected from this trend.",Keep the bar high in terms of hiring. Don't settle just to keep the numbers up.

2018-09-26,,,Former Employee ,SRE robots,,0,None that I can think of.,"It was a very disappointing experience that I hope it will never be repeated ever again in my career. I have been promised a senior SRE job to find out that SRE at Cloudflare actually means watching some screens and when it blinks, click a button to open a page, from where you copy a set of instructions to paste them into your terminal.
Not only that the job descriptions are highly misleading, but it's certainly not a good place if you want to grow. Other than a theoretical description thrown on a piece of paper, there are very, very few genuine senior positions.

The culture is equally bad, everyone is afraid of the CEO, which, also shows it frequently in public, is a very narcissist person. He's also the one that decides your salary, and usually the offer he makes you is non-negociable. Get used to this, as after you join, this is going to be the pattern: whatever he says, you only have to say ""yes"", or you can be fired if you disagree!
Generally speaking, the higher ups have an obvious lack of previous experience in terms of management, and they understand management as a form of kingdom, they being the ones giving orders and the rest have to execute. After arguing a few times with a manager, when they run out of arguments for his terrible idea (which everyone disagreed with), he shouted: ""just do it as I said"".
Not to mention that there's no such thing as equality, definitely not an equal chance employer: if you kiss the right place you're privileged (and the whitelist is pretty short), otherwise they know how to make it a cold place for you.

You cannot attend a conference or a training to help you develop your skills, unless you speak. This is understandable up to an extent, but engineers typically have a strong desire to learn and expand their skill set. They don't offer anything in this direction.
The list of benefits is incredibly short and poor, rather offensive.

Leaving, was the best decisions in my career. I left shortly after I joined, being unhappy that there was a huge mismatch between what I've been promised and what I've actually been offered. At the interviews they make it looks like ""hey we're all friends here"" to find out how much decoupled are the teams, in reality.

The bottom line is: they don't need creative engineers, but robots that only execute orders and don't argue or have opinions / ideas.","Bring and keep more people with experience.

Decent health benefits

Fantastic Marketing & Sales departments

Close to Caltrain and close to the London eye ( this is probably a con for those who actually live in London)","Narcissism in all levels of the company.

People intentionally sabotage and distract meetings to get things done their way.

Little empathy and team spirit.

Not a diverse workforce.

Internal communication frequently contains aggressive language and profanities.

Blog post driven development.

Technical debt is thrown over the fence to SRE without any consideration given to it’s reliability.

Little is transparent about the company. Engineering initiatives, financials, stock, business direction, technical decisions, etc, they’re all guarded.

No career progression for individual contributors.

Decisions are made near the top of the stack.

The only way to get something done is to not follow the processes. If a decision is made at Individual Contributor level it is hidden from the rest of the company until it's too late to discuss it.

Micromanagement is common.

Standard for hiring is really low because of the talent retention issues.

Compensation is low.

Engineering in London and Engineering in San Francisco feel like different companies.

Technical discussions are ""wars of attrition"" where the author and reviewer wear down each others motivation to keep making comments or replying to emails.

Very little collaboration between engineering teams. Most meetings are adversarial, shouting isn't uncommon.

Despite what a recruiter might tell you the company is not engineering driven in the slightest, the product is fairly technical but it's not driven by engineers. Everything is driven by blog.cloudflare.com

The company lurches from one incident to another, never really putting any effort into learning from past mistakes.","Don't take the bus factor too literally, your people are valuable, treat them like they mean something.

2018-07-18, Engineering Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Brilliant engineers, worst leadership in the Bay Area",More than a year,0,"The brightest engineers, full stop.","The CEO is a petty narcissist, that freaks out whenever there is an incident, and shows zero trust in his team. It’s been a known problem for years. No one does anything about it, because they are afraid of him, which is strange, because he’s not a particularly charismatic or intimidating person.

Leadership openly asks managers to write positive Glassdoor reviews, and responds to negative reviews by suggesting employees take it up with their manager. Unfortunately, there is a culture of managers not listening to employees, so nothing changes.

CEO is obsessed with creating an “office culture”, but can’t seem to describe to anyone what that means.

Leadership loves to toss around the “seat on the rocket ship” analogy, but blatantly ignores the fact that rocket ship level engineering requires rigor, deliberation, transparency, and often, moving slower to make sure the right engineering is being done.

The company lurches from one incident to another, never really learning from mistakes, yet is obsessed with growing quickly.

Disaster in the making, and the best employees are leaving right and left.","If you want to grow into a real company, lose all the people that have been promoted because they’ve been at the company a long time.

- Unlimited PTO (whether you can take it is another matter)
- Close to Caltrain and Muni rail","Cloudflare does not have mission values or company culture that promote harmony among all employees. There is a very silo-ed and clique culture within the company and it seems that those who are early employees, hold higher level position or gained favor from the CEO, will have preferential treatments than the others.

The tone from the top seems to reflect this:
- The CEO berating engineers in the company wiki for every one to see.
- A public tweet from the management publicly making fun of a company that tried to do business with Cloudflare
- An offer was extended and rescinded without explanation (search Glassdoor for this review)

If you see search for past reviews, you will notice common theme on what many people think of the CEO (Hint: Arrogant).

People are leaving in droves and quickly replaced by other newcomers and the cycle continues, including high ranking employees.

2016-04-21, Engineering,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Great market, good product (always improving)",More than a year,0,"CloudFlare is a small company (100 engineers, another 150 in other roles) which has a big and growing impact on the Internet -- for the good. Rather than locking website operators into a single ""stack"" from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, or other hosting providers, CloudFlare lets websites choose how to host their site and then get top-quality network edge performance and security between their users and server infrastructure, for a price ranging from free (for millions of sites with less-demanding requirements) to about 10% of what incumbents charge for Enterprise customers.

The biggest reason to work at CloudFlare is to be a part of making the Internet a better place. In contrast to a lot of other companies, CloudFlare has an extremely permissive terms of service, valuing free speech over everything else. While there are a lot of sites on CloudFlare which people find objectionable (for varying reasons), on balance, having open access at the network layer makes the Internet a better place.

There are some big engineering problems to solve -- handling a huge volume of web requests means every other support system is also huge -- so it's a great place to get to work on hard challenges, the latest technology, and with some really smart people.

CloudFlare has both a high media profile and a large userbase, so if you tell someone you work at CloudFlare, you're likely to get a positive response.","The biggest problem with CloudFlare is a legacy of flat organizational structure. For a long time, CloudFlare clung to a ""flat"" organization. This was great back when the company had 25 or 50 employees, but broke down at 100-150. CloudFlare now has a top-tier VP Engineering and some solid engineering managers, but is still implementing the kind of structure a company doing as much as CloudFlare does needs to have.

For a long time, CloudFlare had below-market office environment (a cramped, poorly maintained space), but after 18 months of delays, we finally moved into an amazing dedicated building a block away. People visit and compare it favorably to any company in tech. If you want to be in San Francisco, the location is hard to beat -- a block from Giants Stadium and 2 blocks from Caltrain.

CloudFlare cash compensation is essentially at-market. Equity compensation is less than market, but the company is also on a solid financial footing and good growth trajectory (because people actually need, value, and pay for the product), so it's hard to directly compare to more ""bubble-based"" valuations at other companies. Benefits are decent (free snacks, but only one free meal/week). Good health insurance, no other perks.","Continue adding the kind of structure a great company needs. You're right to eschew process for its own sake, but chaos isn't good, either. Keep true to the values of openness and making the Internet better, and do things to bring the benefits of the product to a greater number and more varied types of customers.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
2016-03-16, Infrastructure,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Looks better from the outside,More than a year,0,"Company is highly visible, in large part because senior leadership goes out of their way to promote themselves personally.

Perfect example, a lot of the ""awards"" they're constant going to fancy dinners to receive were actually bought and paid for via marketing dollars. They used to be really focused on a good ""exit"" but now I wonder with our valuation being the obvious result of a bubble if a lot of management is now on a promotion tour for their next gig.

CEO is a lawyer and sometimes I wonder if that's why we have the weirdest legal team I've ever seen. Since the CEO is obsessive about twitter everyone on that team who wants to ingratiate themselves with him uses it obsessively. Specific example they literally tweeted about a C&D we received from some rapper and the follow calls they had with their counsel. Just embarrassing to have people in those positions so giddy about getting the attention of a hip hop star that they had to rattle off a dozen tweets and facebook posts to brag about it.","Hire a COO who can start to run this like a real company.

There's no compensation for being on-call.

Toxic personalities aren't dealt with at all. In general the people are great to work with but a small minority - including senior management - make it a horrible place to work.

Some legacy tech issues
Simple things are over complicated sometimes
WFH flexibility

The pace of growth of Cloudflare in the last couple of years opened some gaps in processes. This is not a major issue but sometimes you find yourself without a clear understanding on how to deal with a challenge.

As Cloudflare is a tech company some of its internal tools are not straight forward to be configured and used.

Cloudflare is not keen on work from home (and they make it clear during the hiring process) - while I respect this approach, I think it is a privilege that should be given to proven employees.","Keep investing in people!

Not so much now we've outgrown it.","Management (or anyone) in London has no real power or direction over the US fathership despite alluding that they do, making any autonomy hard and getting stuff done harder still if your ideas deviate in any way from the US.

There is no sick pay other than SSP (£80 per week) so whatever you do, don't get sick if you do come to work here.

Most teams are split between US and UK making the time delay a pain for getting things done, and lack of strategic cross site thinking makes for easy mistakes and poor product management and development. Having split site teams also affects management effectiveness and created bad working relationships. Many people are frustrated and feel very much alone when they have most of their team on the other side of the pond.

Misogyny is rife, and untackled. Out of 140+ people in London ~7 are female after FOUR YEARS in London. US led recruitment is poor, and has zero strategy for Europe. They have no dedicated recruiting team for EMEA region.

Interviews are frequently over 10 stages long, and often last months, with little or no feedback. No outbounding on hiring so all hires tend to be white males who apply direct. Almost everyone here wants to be more inclusive but with no support from senior management on making this happen in real terms, we're stuck with being almost exclusively male.

People are very much treated as resources. There's too much work to go round those working here, and the lack of hiring prowess means it will stay that way for some time. Burnout is a thing, to the point where key technical people have started to leaving the company.

There's no product-team style set up, and product management at all in the UK is painfully understaffed and inexperienced. It's a bit like watching children's five a side where everyone just chases the ball (next release) and no one thinks about working towards a more stable strategic picture.","Your people issues (or lack of people, issues) will continue to be your number one problem, until you give it the credit and thought it deserves. You may be getting away by the seat of your pants at the moment, but not only is what you're doing in hiring unethical but it's really bad for your business. Amazed you can't see this.

The people are great to work and chat with. Different backgrounds, smart.
Active in the open source community, giving back.","The recruitment process is long and arduous. There's a lot of interesting interviews, but you have to keep on the ball to keep it rolling, otherwise it will stall, and then you're stuck waiting. The HR process in general is clearly in its infantile stage, but it's clear they're actively working on improving.","Keep improving the recruitment process. Right now you risk losing people simply due to attrition or plain boredom.
Be open about timelines and processes. Discuss them before you start, so the candidate has a rough idea what to expect, who they're going to talk with, how to plan.",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0
2017-07-09,,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Great people - lots of challenges,More than a year,0,"Great people:
* Most colleagues are smart, and nice to work with
* Very varied backgrounds
* Little to no credentialism

Interesting space & scale:
* Cloudflare services a lot of today's internet
* Problems are often due to the large scale, which makes them fun

C-level is transparent (on some things):
* Board meetings are reviewed company-wide
* Financials are there for anyone to see","HR: Very immature processes

* Salary reviews don't really exist, you either get a raise after Q1 or you don't.
* No formal performance reviews (ties in with above).
* No structure around personal development. Changing teams is hard & DIY.

Benefits: Non-US employees are second class, and stock option scheme is intransparent

* UK office lagged significantly in introducing health care, and still has no pension plan.
* Total number of issued stock is treated like a secret by upper management. It seems actively discouraged to figure out what the value of your options is.
* Options scheme is tax efficient for US employees, but not for UK ones, due short excercise window after leaving.

Engineering:
* No end-to-end ownership of products: POCs are often built by one team, and then passed to someone else who has to shoulder production-readiness and maintenance.
* Not enough investment into how software is released, which is a laborious process.","Offices should feel that they are treated roughly the same, and not have SF be the best in terms of benefits, etc. Show that you care about the other half of the company.

Help employees develop. They need to know what their strenghts and weaknesses are. Let them know why they got a raise, or what they should have done to get one.

Opportunity to work on some great engineering challenges.",Weak senior management. We've been promised a pension plan for years now and they have never materialized.

Depending on what market you cover - great whitespace for business to go after.
Friendly and supportive environment. You are NOT just a number.
Unlimited holidays. (see in CONS as well)
Decent product that is very relevant to today's threat landscape.
Depending on when you join/have joint you can make a real impact on this company's success and strategy.","Weak sales leadership is causing an extremely disorganised sales structure.
No sales accelerators. Commission is paid quarterly. Targets are set very high.
Very very low stock options granted.
Cloudflare is definitely an engineering driven company. This may sound alright, but wait and see when you work in sales. This is not good, really.
Unlimited holidays. (You actually take less...""guilty effect"").","Please have clear and concise Sales Structure. We are growing way to fast to be able to be sloppy on this end and it would start hurting really bad if awesome people would leave just because of that.
Especially if you already openly admit that you are aware of the issues.

There is trust in the employees, none of that corporate BS politics that you will experience in large companies. You bring your best work and you will be successful.
Product is already very recognized and respected in the industry.","Training and onboarding is not where more mature companies are.
