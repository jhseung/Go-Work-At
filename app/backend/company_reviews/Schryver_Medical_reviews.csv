If I could give this place 0 stars I totally would. I'm almost positive that the review that was posted on 12/20/2016 was from a manager or team lead because no one in their right mind actually working there now would say that. I worked there for a year and it is the most incestuous place you will ever work. Managers bring in their un-qualified, un-experienced, lazy family members to ""work"" and all they do is sit around and talk, and wait for other people to do their work for them. The organization of this place is close to ZERO, they have no policies and procedures. Management just walks around with an agenda in their hands, and they have ""meetings"" in which you can hear their laughter all around the 5th floor. They demand that you do overtime, and if you don't, then you run a pretty high chance of getting written up for ""insubordination"".

-independence - This job allows you to spend a lot of time alone. Personally this is one of the biggest appeals for me. I like my space. But in the same token help is just a phone call away.
-Variety - Sure a chest X-Ray is a chest X-Ray and that isn't going to change. But when you get to walk into a completely different room with different set up/ layout and equipment every exam can become different. Not to mention getting to interact with staff from multiple facilities (good and bad thing). But for the most part this is pretty awesome. Some facilities are friendlier than others, but i routinely have nurses inviting me to participate in snacks and pot lucks.
-Skills - Thinking outside of the box is key in this job. When you are completely off detent you have to get good at seeing the bigger picture. Being able to see angles and setting manual techniques are I think the biggest takeaways from this job. Working around patients instead of having them conform to an X-Ray room.
-Hours - In a time where company's are moving everyone to part-time, so far we still seem to have a surplus of hours. We have scheduled hours as well as on call hours. Plenty off opportunities to round out paychecks.
-Management - I appreciate having a supervisor's who has done my job. I think this really helps.","-Equipment - Biggest complaint I have about the company/ job is that the equipment is not really taken care of. I feel as though the company should be replacing cassettes/ IP more often. I mean this is a mobile job so things get banged around. But i still feel the current system should be evaluated. Vehicles are old. They get serviced regularly, but it seems like the company waits to the last minute to replace them.
-Hours - On call is nice for hours, but some months I wish it is optional. But this is pretty standard with everywhere I've worked. Also depending on what shift you work it's possible to have to stay past your shift to finish up. Usually balances out but is annoying when you aren't expecting it.

I am desperately attempting to educate my self so that I can seek employment somewhere else. The people that work here are extremely unprofessional. I work in the lab as a tech. Schryver is so cheap they are not willing to pay a Medical Technologist to perform in supervisor positions. I have witnessed them promote other MLT's to act as supervisors in some of their other labs in other states. I have never worked in another lab that allowed completely un-trained, unqualified, un-licensed employees to release patient results and run complex lab instrumentation.

Schryver must employ an amazing legal team to get away with what they do. I do not know how they pass any of their lab inspections.

QA who have no concept of lab instrumentation insist that techs release results from samples that have been collected improperly or are questionable just for the sake of putting out a completed result. No regard for the validity of results, they just want to get paid from the facility.
All of this is know by the lab supervisor who insists that we report out these results. As an MLT, the lab supervisor knows that ethically THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, but goes along with this practice. Grounds for dismissal at any other lab.

Management insists that techs occasionally release results remotely from the Denver lab for testing performed at other labs from Phoenix and Seattle! If you work here and have a professional license, you are risking your future and your career.

I am constantly getting my hours cut. There is no real sense of well-being here. This is definitely not a good long-term employer to consider. I am currently attempting to obtain my ASCP medical technologist licensure so I can leave this place behind.

I could go on forever about how ridiculous this place is, but by now you get the gist of it.","Do not hire a non experienced MLT to be in charge of Chem,heme,coag and micro.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

I worked there for almost a year and right before I left was one of the longest people working there, the location I was at was new and so many people left. I wish I could have left sooner. I worked every weekend for about 5 months and was treated terribly by my lead who was making the schedule, she gave newer people better schedules! She thought she was the queen, her ""friends"" she had, got great treatment and did whatever they wanted for quite some time. Also I had one woman here who harassed me constantly, I told my Lead and told the branch manager but nothing was ever done about it. She still talked down to me and said some really unprofessional inappropriate things that would get her fired anywhere else. She got away with treating even new people terribly. While she was training them telling them they are slow and shouldn't be at this job. Way to go! Scare more people off why don't you...trust me they will be happier. Also near the last month or two of working here I figured out that the men were making a lot more money, hourly, than the women (heard from a few guys I worked with, who were shocked how little I made), and the management lied saying we were all making the same and couldn't afford to give us a slight raise by the end of the year. This should not be happening in this day and time but it still is. I was furious when I found all this out! It's illegal! I know other companies that are similar are making over 10 dollars more than this place. Also if you want to work 10-14 hours every single night this is the place for you. If it's not don't even try. They are so understaffed and expect everyone to move like lightening, and drive 50 miles north and then 70 miles south in traffic and plus a car you can't drive a little over the speed limit in because of ""green roads"". And you are dealing with some patients who have dementia and make things take a while at nursing homes, and going to extra nursing homes because there isn't enough staff....yet still expect you to NOT get any overtime! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? It just made me so mad and stressed out while at this job. I don't know how they are still in business or how anyone could enjoy working here. Management was so negative about so much. I never will come back to this job. They do not care about their staff! The last straw I had was the 3rd shoot out in the area. I was probably a minute away from being right in the middle of it. When I told my Lead I was scared and didn't want to drive in Oakland at night anymore. She told me to suck it up, this is the job!

Hiring new graduates because they are cheap and then expecting them to perform at the same level as someone with 10+ years of experience is ridiculous.
Learn to take constructive criticism. Learning what The business is doing wrong is a prime opportunity to improve.
Involve all employees in various decision making tasks. Remember it is the employees who will have to do whatever it is that is decided upon.
Stop treating employees like they are expendable. One of the biggest wastes of money is hiring someone, training them and then deciding to get rid of them because they said something you didn't agree with or you decide you don't like them. And stop hiring warm bodies just to fill a position! Be selective and make sure the person fits the job.
Evaluate your spending a little more closely. Spending money to train facilities to use the computer system the company spent a lot of money on and then not requiring facilities to use that system and expecting internal departments to compensate is not the definition of cost
effective.
