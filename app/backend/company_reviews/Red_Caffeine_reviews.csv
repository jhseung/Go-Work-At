Red Caffeine gives you the opportunity to explore the world of marketing and see where you can excel. You never get bore, and rarely go a day without learning something new. The culture is unlike anything else, and is worth more than any salary could offer you. Being excited to get up and go to work in the morning doesn't happen to everyone. They are an open book company, so you always know where you stand as a company financially, which takes a lot of courage as a business owner.","With it still being a startup there are definitely some growing pains, but everyone is committed to mending them. This can range everywhere from internal operations, to career pathing. The pros definitely outweigh the cons here.",,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

2018-08-24,,,Current Employee ,Growing Company,Growing Company,0,"It's an entrepreneurial environment that allows employees across the agency to make an impact if they take the initiative to do so. I've learned so much at RC -- understanding our financials, working with tough personalities, understanding business and marketing strategies. Life at RC is fast-paced and there's always something interesting brewing. I also really love my coworkers. There's a lot of strong personalities, but we have fun and genuinely care about one another.","The limited time off policy kills me. Also, we suffer from shiny object syndrome, which makes it hard to follow our primary company goals and direction. I think those are my primary gripes and every company has some issues like that. RC has made leaps and bounds of improvements in processes and management structures the last year or two, so that's encouraging.",Would love more time off earlier in my RC career.

Overall, a really cool place to be a part of and contribute to making the company vision become a reality.","Operational processes are still being established, tested out and revised due to the youth of the company. Communication and meeting efficiency/effectiveness is still being worked on. Being a small team means that you don't always work within your job description (which, depending on who you are, might be fun!). Very high performance expectations (again... not a bad thing, unless you have a hard time receiving constructive criticism and having a strong voice when communicating opinions/feedback).
