Using Atlassian tools for all aspects of work provides great transparency and efficiency.","Extremely poor management on some teams. Where those managers exist, and valid concerns have been made to HR, problems are brushed under the carpet. The main goal has become productivity - so when it comes down to it, the values go out the window. This undermines any trust any employee can have in the company. The values have become more of a marketing / recruiting strategy rather than something employees can believe in and do their best work to support.","Be radically honest about managers who product results, but kill the culture.

2019-01-11, Senior Support Engineer,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Stay away from the Support organization,More than a year,0,"Great benefits, generous stock grants, fun office, lots of company events.

The company overall is an amazing place. It's a fantasy world that doesn't exist in many other places. The people there are generally great. Being in that office you feel like you are definitely doing something special with your life.

If you get on the right team Atlassian will be the great company you will ever work for. There are a few areas within support that have a lot of happy people(but its rare).","If you get on the wrong team Atlassian will be the worst company you will ever work for.

Everyone on the Jira team is unhappy but no one can leave. The stock compensation is so great that you will never find another role that pays better than your Atlassian salary + bonus + stock RSUs. This means unhappy people keep sticking around with their Golden Handcuffs getting tighter and tighter. After enough time you've lost more technical skills than you've gained so now are even more stuck.

Obsession with metrics keeps everyone overworked and overstressed. Chasing arbitrary performance improvement goals leads to management working to block support engineers from participating in all the amazing company events.

Your worth is measured by the time you sit in a chair at your desk rather than the results you deliver.

Management uses Confluence to run projects because they can't be bothered to learn arguably the best project management tool out there, Jira. Even the Jira support team can't use Jira to manage projects because management can only use a wiki tool.

 Senior engineers on Jira support team are turned into supervisors to help whip the team harder and increase throughput, rather than focusing on technical work which would actually solve issues.

Training was a joke, engineers are provided 4 hours to watch some YouTube videos or read some text and claimed to have ""skilled up"". Management has no understanding that technical training is something that has to be continuous and takes real time.
Training of course requires long term investment, in the short term it requires engineers to not produce units of work with the understanding that it the time will pay off in the long run. This isn't valued because the metrics are looked at on a daily basis, all focus is on finishing the day/week with the highest numbers possible and dealing with tomorrow another day.

The interview process is misleading. It's a very technical interview promising you will do a lot of technical work. Then you start and find out you are supervising people and documenting every conversation you have with junior engineers so that it can be weaponized by management.

Your technical abilities will die here because all of your brainpower is devoted to playing the politics.","Happy engineers will deliver more and higher quality work.

Training has to be ongoing and frequent.

Between management, senior engineers and entire teams dedicated to metrics the investment is too high for the return. Spending so much money trying to squeeze single percentage point improvements out of engineers isn't worth it. Take that money and hire more engineers, focus on quality rather than quantity, focus on the technical work that the customers need rather than making lines on a graph go up.

Managers need to have a better understanding of the work their teams do. Managers need training on how to utilize Atlassian tools to do their jobs so they can use Jira to manage projects rather than wiki pages and Google docs.",2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0

The office is gorgeous and has amazing views, there a lot of events going on and there is a sense of pride in working at Atlassian.","The interview process is complex and quite long, with deep technical questions - although these are fairly scattered over multiple technologies and vary from light to very indepth. There is no real order to the interviews, but tend to be based on who ever interviews you.

When you start at Atlassian you'll be happy given all their marketing and shiny office, but once you sit down in support you'll quickly come to realize there's little connection to the Atlassian that other departments experience.

In support you'll experience:
-Management changing their expectations of their staff daily, they seem in a constant panic.

-Support organization cannot decide if its a contact center or a deep dive technical support team and end up asking the techs to do both

-With metrics constantly changing staff tend to get treated more based managers preference than based on their job performance

-Managers have no confidence and will single you out if you highlight any issues, even if you're trying to improve them

-Seems sure that its a highly technical support role, but limit training and focus on throughput rather than ability or quality

-The team has almost no morale from the constant changing expectations and no one even expects to meet goals they can't predict and know will change

-Senior positions are guarded by older employees that raise the requirements to unrealistic and unnecessary standards; senior techs would rather convince you that they're more technical than assist their peers in succeeding

-Their location is great but parking in the building costs $25/day until you get a spot (the waiting list is now about a year)","Compare the feedback you're getting to the 'company values' you say you try work by- you'll find a huge difference.

If this is you, you'll have lots of good experiences - meeting a lot of people at the same stage in their lives/careers, being able to volunteer easily, take yoga classes at work, get free food, take on resume-building leadership roles like being your team's social chair or becoming a member of the foundation (volunteering group) council etc. This will probably be the ""best place you ever worked"" which is a goal for the company. You should remember to blog about all these things on the internal Confluence site for maximum benefit.

You can bring your dog to work as often as you want. If you like dogs or have a dog, this is a good place for you.

What else? General conversation topics are dogs, yoga, what someone posted on Instagram, fashion, the newest restaurant, wine, and the SF rental market.
If these are your go-to topics, you'll do great here.

Oh, and you'll probably get to go to Sydney at some point so that's pretty cool.","For more experienced folks and especially if you are mid-30s and later with a life outside of work/work colleagues, note that most senior roles/middle management seem to be taken by the folks who joined in the 2012-2014 timefame. Senior roles (principal, head of etc) seem to be few and far between for internal and external growth, and it may be difficult to succeed in these (see cliques below).

Most things are done the ""Atlassian way"", which is a reason given to do things the same way every time. So if you have ideas or suggestions, perhaps from prior experiences, these are only accepted if they align exactly with how things are already done or if you have a sponsor who OKs them. New ideas and suggestions are mostly encouraged only if you've been around for a while and are in one of the cliques. So it's pretty collaborative if you have the same opinions and methods, may feel dismissive otherwise. I know folks who have left the company precisely because of this.

Cliques: Other reviews mention ""cronyism"", ""groupism"" and ""communism"" :). These seem to be mostly informal networks dominated by folks hired in 2012-2014, and span SF/Austin/Sydney etc. These folks are pretty close to the long-time leaders. If you grew up in the company, you've paid your dues and you will get opportunities. If you grew up elsewhere, getting opportunities and getting in with the right cliques may be difficult and time-consuming. In fact multiple people across a variety of teams have gone through some pretty rough times when not in the right cliques.

Also the compensation seems to be below market. And promotions seem to go to people who have been here for a while.

If you are not a dog person or are allergic to dogs... you are in for a tough time. There are even off-leash dogs in the kitchen where people eat/handle food!

There are processes in place for everything, using Jira and Jira Service Desk. Even the smallest request to another team has to go through a ticketing process. If you are from a much larger company, you are probably OK with this pace. If you came here thinking ""modern startup"", you may be frustrated by the pace.

The company is very proud of its published values... but it seems folks have different interpretations. For example, ""open company, no BS"" - sometimes this seems to mean that things are transparent and open if you are in the right group. And there's ""play, as a team"" but then cliques come into play so interpret that as you would like.","Figure out if Atlassian wants to be the ""best place to work"" for everyone, or just early-career employees. And deal with the cliques - as many of the reviews suggest, you might be losing some really good talent because of these. Considering that HR is constantly asking us to refer our friends all the time, letting good talent walk away simply because they are a bit different or have new ideas about how to achieve our goals seems strange. And regarding our culture - think about how to make it welcoming and fresh.",3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

- You'll be working alongside some awesome people. The majority of people are extremely friendly and are almost always willing to lend a hand.

- There's a lot of senior talent. If you're new to the game you can learn a lot.

- You get a lot of autonomy in your day to day work.

- Our company values actually mean something. A lot of people live the values and we celebrate that openly as a company.

- Work/life balance is great, though that seems to get tougher and tougher the higher up the ladder you go.

- Free lunch and perks.

- Despite all the problems listed below, they're genuinely trying to fix them and make it a better place for everyone to work.","- Sometimes it can seem as if we're moving at a glacial pace, other times we're moving way too fast. We need to find a good pace and stick with it.

- A lot of the work done doesn't ship for various reasons. We pivot a lot and other times a bigger, more important project will come along which means the current work gets canned and the team transitions to a different project.

- Atlassian has a tendency to tackle big projects all at once which means they can drag on for years.

- Compared to the market average, Atlassian underpays. This is true for Sydney and the US.

- We say ""Open company, no bull#$%"" but there's a lot of bureaucracy at the top.

- If you don't have a good manager who will fight for you, you're going to struggle. This is especially important when it comes to performance reviews and interesting projects.

- Atlassian favours extroverts. The only way to get yourself out there and known to senior management is by promoting your work and speaking at town halls or writing blog posts on the global Confluence instance.

- Favourites get the interesting work. This is great if you're a favourite, but can be hard if you're an introvert and don't like promoting yourself or if you have a bad manager.

* Our values carry real weight! e.g. people are willing to be candid about how they feel (open company no bullsh*t)** and to take actions to make things better (be the change you seek).

* While I do know people whom I feel haven't gotten a fair shake, to a remarkable degree Atlassian strives to do right by everyone who works here, regardless of their level. The engineers-as-fatted-calves syndrome seems to be less of a thing, which is awesome. (That's coming from an engineer, though, so take it with a grain of salt?)

* Similarly, while we've had an amazing run so far, we are facing new and much more competent competitors than we're used to. It's not clear that folks in Sydney feel the heat the same way all of us living in the bubble do. Complacency is lethal.","* Eventually, our below-market compensation will lead to attrition. By then it will be too late. The late-stage pre-IPO glamour is over; people need better base salaries, soon.

* Things have felt less candid than usual lately. The same questions keep coming up in all-staffs and they're not given real answers. That's a departure from the norm, and it's a bit sad.

When I started at Atlassian in 2014, I didn't really buy into what I was being told about culture and values, etc, but I signed on anyway since the pay was decent for a Support job and the people I met were all very nice. Now that I have been around for a while, I can honestly say that the Atlassian values are not bs and that, for the most part, the company cares about its culture. I used to work for another company that used to blow its culture up your rear end during the recruiting process, but when they went public, it became obvious that culture was not as important as those shareholders. One of things that I have been pleased about with Atlassian is that, so far, the transition to a public company has not really done much to the culture other than reinforce it. Working in Support, you are at the bottom of the totem pole and the work can be difficult, but I still look forward to coming in and working with my team every day and that is saying a lot (refer back to my comments about being old and jaded). Atlassian seems to care about its employees in ways that other companies may preach about, but don't really back up with their wallets.","The company is based in Sydney and most of the development is handled there. Since Sydney is literally in tomorrow, it makes communication between offices difficult. It's is obvious that our Support folks in AUS are much more involved with engineering than the rest of us around the world are. As others have mentioned, the company has a heavy bias towards developers and their work styles and life styles. While I don't feel that this is intentional, it still doesn't feel good to be told how important events are like ShipIt and then be told by your manager that you can't participate because someone needs to be around for the customers. I don't feel or notice the attitudes that others have noticed (maybe that is an AUS phenomenon), but there is certainly a feeling of disconnect between what feels like the privileged developer class and the rest of us.","I feel that Atlassian has weathered its growth a lot better than most and the culture has adapted well. When I had the opportunity to speak with Scott Farquar about my concerns about losing the culture after we went public, he looked me in the eye and said he'd never let that happen. I believed him then and I still do now. Let's make sure that fire is maintained across all the offices and all the departments.

Lots and lots of attention paid to little details around the office - food, events, and general atmosphere - which make it a generally pleasant work environment. Everyone is encouraged to speak their mind.","It's a company founded by and for developers, so if you aren't a developer then it's easy to feel left out. (I can't just stop doing my job for the fun hackathon; if I stop doing my job then things break, badly.) Many in the company also tend to forget that incremental improvement is sometimes a better option for change than doing all the things at once.

There's so much to be done that it's disturbingly easy to overextend. Teams can be a bit scattered geographically, which makes collaboration difficult, and there's a very strong bias in favor of Sydney when it comes to promotions, thought leadership, and meeting scheduling.

Too much information on CAC and not clean to be able to sort and know what is accurate and/or what is important.

They offer nearly-free health, vision, and dental insurance. They have a swanky, open floor plan San Francisco office and there’s a lot of opportunities to travel to other offices or speak at conferences in other countries. There’s some genuinely good natured and hard working people there. They drive you really hard and you will become better in your field but be warned...","To start, there's very little training into the vast, internal structure or options for outside training. There is a ton of in-speak, acronyms, and politics to understand to be effective. Managers tend to focus on improving your weak points instead of bolstering your strengths. Decisions are made via waterfall and handed down from the executive layer with little regard to the impact those decisions have on the end user. If you have a bad relationship with your manager don't expect much help or mediation. When I asked who to talk to about being mismanaged and verbally abused I was told that I shouldn't bring it up and just power through until the manager in question moved on to harass another employee. There's an underlying current of gossip and politics and the ""Open Company"" part of their values is totally [inaccurate].

The Culture: Everyone plays second fiddle to the Sydney office. There are more promotions and raises in the Sydney office. Diversity is a joke, a literal joke. The head of HR has a staff of beautiful, young, blond women and has an office deemed the ""Man Cave"". The open office arrangement makes for a lot of distractions. Whether it’s dogs barking, the beer bikes, or a mariachi band (I swear to God that happened) they don’t seem to want to promote a productive environment. The office is located a block from the San Francisco County Jail and a park with one of the few public bathrooms in SoMa. There’s a lot of homeless harassment, human waste and crime you have to consider when coming to/from the office. If you drive in, they don't reimburse you for parking.

The tools: Atlassians “dogfood” all their own software which is cool in theory. Most of the software is groaning under it’s own infrastructure and poor IT and is very buggy since you’re seeing a development version and not production software. Somedays the inferior system you’re forced to use crashes for half a day and you have to work over the evening to make up for it. They don’t like email. Expect 90% of your communications to happen through their instant messaging app (also inferior) which will undoubtedly lead to miscommunications within your team.

Their future: I expect to see a lot of employees leaving and cashing out their stock after they IPO. There's a lot of poor business decisions being made right now to try and boost the share price and with little regard to the customers who support them. That's bad business.","Lighten up. Atlassian isn’t the pinnacle of technology you think it is. Your flagship software only gets by on it’s rapidly-depleting reputation and the atrocious performance issues coupled with feature bloat are starting to show. You’ve moved all your eggs into a basket that’ll never be better than 2nd place and is completely uninventive/uninteresting to employees, customers and investors alike. Good on ya mates!

San Francisco employees want better work on stronger products, not more perks for you to hid behind. Letting the board of directors decide what you should build is an obvious bad decision but I guess the two “genius” founders are well aware of that by now. Mike and Scott are not the right executive leadership. It's clear to a lot of people that the company has outgrown them.

Promote your employees best qualities don’t nitpick their shortcomings. You hired them because they offer you something your teams need that they don’t have, why discard that so quickly?

As a woman, it's among the most friendly, open and supportive tech companies I've ever worked at - I haven't even had a whiff of the sexual harassment types of things I saw over the years.

The management team is humble and philanthropic - it's genuinely inspiring to work with them and for them. It doesn't feel like everyone's just there for the money and there are very few politics relative to other companies I've worked at before.

There is politics, but for the most part, you are valued for what you have to contribute to the table. The amount of transparency is staggering: it's not every company where any Joe Blow can query the company data warehouse or simply ask what the top secret project is.

Atlassian has some of the best people working for it that you'll ever find, and I genuinely look forward to coming into work. It's exciting times, if you like building new stuff or breaking new ground, and I've not stopped learning since I've gotten here.","Like many companies that are explosively growing, things don't always scale up fast enough. Like many of the other people here, I'll point out that not all is right with Kansas, and there's some spring cleaning that needs to be done of some of the cruft.

I would say that there's a lot less cruft than I've seen elsewhere, but I'll certainly acknowledge that it exists.

For other cons, it takes a tremendous amount of energy to course correct, though this is kind of a first world problem. Most other companies wouldn't even offer you the option to course correct, but Atlassian does-it just takes a lot of patience and asbestos suits.

Compared to the outside, Atlassian compensation kind of blows, but there are some nice perks to make up some of it. It really is a pleasant place to work, but you can make more elsewhere.","You have some great people working for you, but you also have some junk in the corners.

Atlassian has a great brand, it probably looks great on your CV","When Atlassian goes bad, it goes really bad.
There's a lot of project churn (projects appearing and then disappearing)

Managers at Atlassian aren't great. Every manager I've had has been a former developer who moved into a team lead role.

 Nominally speaking, you'd think this sounds great. However getting the most out of people isn't something that a career in writing software prepares you for from what I can see.

When they leave you alone, they're mostly benign, although you'll have to find your own career path.
If you have sustained high work output, and you know when to keep your mouth shut, you'll be in this category most of the time.

If you happen to get their attention for the wrong reasons however, you're in for a world of pain. Their abilities at ""performance improvement"" are mostly limited to threatening to fire you.

FYI take the values with a grain of salt, they used to mean a lot to a lot of people (management and staff) but their meaning has become diluted as people have been hired who don't share the same values.","Really invest in training your front-line people managers, as in ""6 months of an MBA"" kind of training not a ""1 day crash course on how to manage people"" kind of training.

2018-09-24,,,Former Employee ,If you're in Sydney - stay away,,0,Looks good on your CV,"I would recommend against working here if you're in Sydney because:

1) Pay sucks
Yes it sucks. Employees complain about it all the time. The company don't even pretend that they are trying to pay you fairly saying they are aiming for the median of the market, which is code for undervaluing you and your skills. Other people in the company doing the exact same work but in the US will get paid much more than you, well over and above the exchange rate.
If you ask, management will give promises about improving pay but nothing really changes. With inflation, you will go out backwards.

The Founders are now so rich I think they have no concept of what life is like for wage slave employees. When you pay 70 million dollars for a house it's inevitable I suppose. If you ask them about pay or about how expensive living in Sydney is your question will probably be ridiculed or ignored.

Sadly, you're better off working for a bank, which is really saying something.

2) There are no more interesting or challenging roles left in Sydney.

Unless you consider working on a 15 year old disaster codebase fun.
The only people in the Sydney office who don't seem to notice have been around so long they no longer feel the pain of banging their head against a wall.

Entire teams have been moved offshore. If a great new role comes up there's a good change it will go to someone on a visa. I have seen locals regularly passed over for interesting roles.

3) You must conform or you won't fit in
The Founders have very strong views. Watch out if you don't agree. You will be publicly shamed into conforming or keeping your mouth shut. Unless you are a strong fit for far left social views and far right economic views you won't feel like you belong.","Stop trying to get away with paying your employees less than their skills are worth.

- Big company, a lot of people occasionally you've meet great people accidentally gets in, they won't stay long though
- Lots of different technical challenge to work on, you'll have to pay tax though, tributes the all the parasites that this company has accumulate for years. My advice is do not ague with them, do not point out their stupidity if they outranked you that will not ends well for you. In my last year I prefer throwing out my personal projects rather than let them lay their dirty hands on it. And believe me because the thieves do not actually have any work to do, they will be scouting all your resources to find anything they can steal or demand a piece of it. Even if you give them your work they won't be able to finish it(that what I did in my earlier years at the company), you have to do it and then give them the credits.
- Interesting facades, sadly none is true.","- Working here is throwing your career into the toilet, that is if you want to build or engineer systems or real functionalities that serves real world purposes. Unless you want to be a salesman, fraud then this will be the experience you'll need.
- Lazy and uneducated management only care about building their personal cult and tribe. Underlings in term focus on writing songs about their superiors and back stabbing each other, exploiting subodinates. You'll be force to join a tribe, help them attack the other, or you'll pay dearly price.
- Brainless people chaining meaningless phrase all the time without any care for customer experience or the product to be crafted, every failure is consider another success. No intention of improving the quality of the product, personal shortcoming and the environment. Is it not only sad because they keeps repeating something stupid and untrue, but also it's not even their original thought. I do not know if most people here even use their brains for thinking, but might be they do, it's just not about producing value.
- Performance and contribution will not factor into your payroll, money goes to the loudest and laziest back stabber and looter, who aligned with management groups.
- Arrogant and illiterate politicians aim to suck dry the company and honest folks who work hard to keep things going.","Stop eating please. Use your brain sometimes, I know it's hard but it'll be worth it.",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Be careful what mention in 1:1's as it will all be used against you

You are required to spend extra hours blogging about everything you did, as otherwise you will be deemed as not performing at all
Every manager has their favourites and unless you are a favourite, you will have 0 chance of promotion or even having your thoughts listened to. It is not a collaborative environment anymore, that disappeared years ago.
The advertised values are a joke. Don't ""hurt"" the customer? Why do team leads punish people for working on long running issues in JIRA? Be the change you seek? If you do something that 1 person on a team of 50 is vocal against, then you get punished verbally and at review time. Just 2 examples I have seen .... not good enough.

Scott’s personal mission seems to be to ensure that your experience with Atlassian is so great that everything else is ruined by comparison. I disagree. The experience at Atlassian was so good that I want to take some of that magic and sprinkle it over all future roles. I’m not saying it was perfect, it wasn’t, but in some ways that was also part of its magic. It’s owned its mistakes and empowered everyone within to do the same. Yes, the perks are amazing (particularly the equity), but beyond the free food and booze, the family events, the incredible experience team, the biggest perk by far is the values. Positive cultural values have to be driven from the very top and Scott and Mike embody these. There is nothing disingenuous about them and everything that the company does is driven by them. It’s life changing. Also they’re not afraid to be on the right side of the argument on progressive social good. When they shon a rainbow over 341 George St during the postal survey was probably the proudest I’ve ever felt to be part of something truly wonderful. And Atlassian are.","They’ve struggled with scale as any company would with the massive growth like they have had. The IPO led to a huge loss of key talent which exacerbated some of those issues. However, transparency and openness meant that we all knew what was happening, and everyone was empowered to keep the ship afloat.

It took them too long to realise that people in leadership roles need to be good managers, not necessarily great coders, when they got to 2000 employees, and it wasn’t until I left that they even began to put in the frameworks necessary for leaders to properly lead.

After a certain point there’s a career wall with nowhere left to go, I’d still be there now if you didn’t need to be there for a decade, or American, to get to the next level. There’s too much reliance on SF being the boilerplate of how to do things, and it’s lacking empathy for local culture and people based in Sydney.

I also noticed that any innovative idea that would sideline/outshine a showcase deliverable by the more influential people was deliberately postponed or suppressed by prioritising minor work in the name of urgency. Even the good or challenging work was allocated to favourites in the team

I noticed a lot of duplicate work/services was being done in their platform engineering teams because it was important for the managers to ensure they have some work to show.

Events, free food, free drinks, free bar, social atmosphere

Aeon chairs, standup desks for the `startup` image

Atlassian has a high barrier for entry and have some very talented people working for them. On the right team the experience can be amazing. On joining Atlassian I worked on the best team of 10 years in software development.","After IPO Atlassian has changed significantly.

2 years ago there where 500-700 members of staff, now 1700+.

Heavy recruitment, reorganisation, re-prioritisation, shareholders to answer to, there is a great deal of growing pain. It’s no longer the small company it once was but not at the larger company maturity level in regards to HR / management. Internal mobility is non existent. There’s significant growing pains and power / self protection struggles by managers who have time earnt their way to positions rather than being trained in management.

In the 10 years I spent in software development I had my best experiences at Atlassian. With that it’s extremely disappointing and sad to say my last 12 months at Atlassian has also been the worst and most stressful.

An extremely strong team I worked on who were delivering was split up, partly because of reorganisation and skills needed elsewhere, mainly as the technology we were using no longer fitted in to the new `Tech Radar` and immediate management wanted to water down the strongobjections by bringing in people who advocated the new `Tech Radar` stack...Nodejs, Springboot (only Springboot with Java) and Go.

I watched a good team turn toxic, one painful memory, all members sat with heads down in a PR review when the dev manager crossed lines through valid team PR feedback after a colleague elsewhere in the company brought on to make our project more `Spring` like. On node.js projects any comments on Javascript where taken as attacks against the manager, PR comments watched, hipchat messages watched only to be raised in 1 and 1’s. Team members played against each other and micromanaged to fit the new `Tech radar`. I watched a good colleague put on performance review for use of Java 8 Lambda’s which looked to functional for the `Tech stack` before he subsequently resigned or debatably constructively dismissed.

The IPO has lead to new large critical projects putting pressure on inexperienced management who have been at the company a long time working their way up. This has then been put down on to developers, decisions based on time, appearance of delivering and ability to recruit. It somewhat changed from a collaborative “we hire smart people atmosphere to tell us what to do not to tell them what to do” to bodies of developers micromanaged as a workhouse.

Pick the right team and if the current `Tech stack` attracts you, you will have a fantastic experience at Atlassian. Hit the wrong team or if the company decides to switch again you are collateral damage and it’s hard to move internally with outside staff favored for roles due to recruiting targets.

Developers raising concerns were noted as being `salty`, `a religious small minority` by the recently appointed CTO and founders. The same people raising concerns where some of the strongest most talented engineers who cared strongly about the work and quality of work they were doing.

Other downsides are sometimes you are lead to feel like you should feel privileged working for Atlassian. Mandatory on call was introduced putting significant restrictions on movement and activities in personal / family time. It was non-negotiable, significant change to current duty, roles and contract with very poor compensation. Trying to discuss the new requirement was returned with `it’s mandatory`, `take one for the team, Atlassian give you free food`.

For people being relocated overseas Atlassian only offered help in the form of cash which was fair in the sense it covered flights and shipping and initial hotel costs but you won’t have much if any left. The fee is taxed quite heavily, it can also hang over you with the crawlback clause it you are no longer enjoying your time at the company within the period set out. Atlassian could help out better on the relocation assisting in advice for people new to Australia such as the property market, banking, utilities, tax, day to day stuff you need to set up on arriving to Australia but may not be familiar with when you get here and start work.","Internal workplace happiness surveys have taken a significant hit the past 12 months. Atlassian has many passionate, talented people. Address the feedback, don't dismiss it as a `small minority`. It upsets me how I was once doing the work of my life and singing the praises of Atlassian to working in the worst atmosphere of my life.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Toxic management. Publicly praising any changes introduced is better than any kind of criticism. People who actually care and try to be ""the change they seek"" (one of the company values) are flagged as negative which effectively translate to no career opportunities ever.

Management changes all the time. Normally external people are preferred, very few have the opportunity to be promoted and those who get promoted are normally based on office politics rather than performance or skills.

The best way to be noticed (and have any career development opportunities) is to be a narcissistic extroverted person who spends their day blogging about awesomeness instead of getting any actual work done.

Most of the good people left the company a long time ago. Crazy people turnover at all levels. In 3 years in the same team, I had 4 different team leads, 5 office leads, 3 HR managers,.... Recruitment standards also dropped over time, now hiring mainly young and inexperienced (and also underpaid) people.

The manageers in the Amsterdam office have very little weight in the company and hardly any decision making. All important (and most trivial) decisions are made in Australia by people who lacks the understanding and knowledge of the Amsterdam office and its people.

The culture has changed from a nice start-up atmosphere living the values of the company to a toxic culture rotten with politics and asslickery. The once idealistic values have been bastardized like in a George Orwell novel.","I think it is too late to bring back the good old times, but at leas I would focus on evaluating people on their performance and skills rather that other superficial aspects.

Super-energetic environment, can-do culture, high level of trust, opportunities to go and build something useful outside your normal work stream.

Company's strong values got it this far; strong focus on maintaining and evolving an effective culture despite rapid hiring.

Great level of passion and enthusiasm for what we build and what we deliver to our customers - it's useful, worthwhile software that makes a difference to our customer's ability to get things done, and we don't forget that!

Strong technical and quality focus. We don't tend to get stuck on doing things the same way just because that's how it's been in the past; new hires have a good chance of bringing new knowledge/ideas and changing things.","It's chaotic, both technically and organisationally, as it deals with aggressive modernisation of legacy platforms and architectures into a more modern approach, and grows and evolves from a high-individual-freedom low-oversight small-company culture to one with a little bit more forethought and management that is able to scale. So far the balance is working very well though.

Arriving as a new developer working on any of the main products (vs new infrastructure, which is different), there's a lot of complexity and legacyness, large teams and an awful lot to learn, both technically and organisationally, and this can be overwhelming - expect 6-9 months before you feel able to effectively contribute to gnarly stuff to the large products. You'll need to have initiative and be willing to reach out, ask questions and make things happen.","Pour more resources into nuking the legacy stuff, it's the only way to maintain dev speed.
Be careful the current annual review system doesn't move in the direction of notoriously harmful stack-ranking systems. Effective delivery is from teams, not individuals. Our talk and our acqui-hiring reflects this, but our annual review system is too much all about individuals, and that will eventually lead to destructive politics and self-promotion. You need to find a way to more formally rate the effectiveness of teams, distribute rewards across team, and especially to send a strong message that people will be rated on team effectiveness not on individual contribution.

2016-04-13, Senior Software Developer,Sydney (Australia),Former Employee ,Lots of great things but lots of room for improvement,More than 8 years,0,"Several of the products are legitimately ""best of breed"" with tens of thousands of customers that genuinely love the product. A chance to work on something that really helps teams, as opposed to something that sells ads.

The company values mean something. Sure, not all of them. (No one seems to really agree on what Build With Heart And Balance means.) And not 100% every day. But overall, the values drive the company more than most.

Many of the executives really care about having a great place to work. The ""Experience Team"" does a fantastic job of making every-day life at work pretty good, whether it is big events (like annual friends and family day) or small events (like ""sillybrations"" on wacky quasi-holidays).

For most people, there is a pretty good work-life balance. Most people work 9-5. Almost no one works weekends. It is a big company with many projects and teams, so this can vary somewhat. But if you walk around the office at 6pm it is pretty empty.

Atlassian has pretty modern product management practices. Yes, there is room for improvement. Yes, there are companies out there do it a better or more consistently. But if you read any book or blog on modern cutting edge product management you'll think, ""Hey, Atlassian has been working like that for a while already.""

The vast majority of your coworkers are smart and have their hearts in the right place. You will rarely feel like you're engaged in turf wars or politics or working with deadweight.","Salaries are flat out low relative to the talent levels and amount of equity given out doesn't fill the gap. The current weakness of the Australian dollar means jobs everywhere else in the world look appealing. Moving to Australia is a big draw but it is near impossible to get senior talent, especially from the US, to consider moving.

There are a lot of teams. Quite a few of them are not an ideal choice. Either because they're working on an also-ran product, because they're strategic priority #42, or because they're dealing with morass of cross-product work. For instance, you can work on billing systems at Atlassian...or thousands of other companies.

Some people and positions do not have good work-life balance. Often this comes from Team Leads or other more senior developers who put in long hours. Sometimes this is due to lack of training in delegation skills. Other times it is due to skill/expertise gaps. (When you grow this fast, you might be the only person on your team who has been around long enough to understand how that subsystem works.)

Quite a bit of silo-ification between products and geographies. That's somewhat understandable as the company has grown but it was a problem even when it was substantially smaller. This is a bit ironic given the tools that Atlassian makes.

I doubt this is unique to Atlassian but Product Management reigns supreme (over design and engineering). PMs are the ones who have meetings with the CEOs and GMs. There has been significant turnover among PM ranks and the general consensus is that the PM discipline has stagnated since a reorg from a functional structure a few years ago. The failure rate of new hire PMs is staggeringly high compared to any other role in the company.

Engineering and Product Development is a strength but many other functions have lots of room for improvement. HR is a perennial sore point for many. Lack of training and career progression have been a top complaint for years and very little has improved. Rollout of new systems (like applicant tracking systems) and processes takes just as long as at many other companies.

There's no two ways about it: legacy code. The main products are over a decade old. Atlassian has done an admirable job of maintaining high R&D investments (instead of turning them into cash cows with skeleton maintenance crews). But you'll be working on 13-year old Java download applications. The company is in the midst of an existential shift to find its way to a SAAS future but there's a huge gap between the products as they are today and how a product built from scratch would look.","HR still is far from world class, probably time to shake things up in the function. Lots of changes in strategy and direction that are not fully communicated. Probable underinvestment in engineering infrastructure stuff at the expense of product & features over the years has resulted in slowing development velocity (though that is obviously a contestable point). Find a way to reinvigorate Product Management: maybe bring back a role to help champion the improvement of that function.",4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
2016-04-10, Software Engineer ,Sydney (Australia),Current Employee ,Pass the kool-aid & make sure you blog it.....,More than a year,0,"Interesting work if you can get onto the right team. Chances to become full stack developer and try out some new technologies. Some smart people to learn from if you can look past the ego it is coming from, at the same time. Well stocked kitchens. I would recommend to a friend as has the chances for some nice work, and looks like a nice stepping stone to something else in the future.","Getting on the right team can be difficult. Salary is low. Salary details are not shared (and for good reason as there is a massive different between salary for the exact same positions throughout the company) and it will usually take sourcing other employment opportunites to discover your true worth and get HR to do anything about it, if you are deemed worthy of keeping. And while the company considers itself very collaborative, this is taken to the extreme and unless you are able to self-promote every single thing you do, every single day, then no one will have any idea that you even exist ..... Worse of all though for me is the shifting goalposts. Performance reviews are quite a joke as they entirely depend on which team you work on, and how good a buddies you are with your Team Lead. Just doing excellent work is not enough, as even though, yes you fixed this stupidly outdated and broken process, but you failed to blog about it for 3 weeks prior to actually making the change and 2 people over there had an error this morning and instead of fixing it had to spend 1 hour figuring out who to blame (when they could have actually read the 1 blog that you did write (but 10 is better than 1 off course!) ..... Anyway, most of this stems from far too many people drinking the kool-aid on a daily basis, which in my opinion is caused by the fact that for the majority of people, they have never experienced anything else in their working careers.","Maybe this culture worked for a small startup, but will it really continue to work in the future?

A lot of extremely talented people are doing amazing work, and genuinely want to help everyone else do amazing work as well. Knowledge sharing is highly encouraged, and while that can sometimes produce information overload, it’s still good to know that you can find out what any other team is working on if needed.

There are many opportunities for people who want to try different things IF you can find the right people to talk to. From switching product teams for new perspectives, to trying out whole new career paths. I’ve seen many people do role changes: devs, tech writers, product managers, program/project managers, support engineers...

While knowledge sharing across divisions is encouraged, it’s becoming less and less frequent. Silo mentality has well and truly set in after so much rapid growth. Almost every team is doing things in different ways.

Sometimes it feels as if the company has bought into its own marketing hype, and has lost a sense of perspective about what actually makes it a good company.

HR's main concern is promoting their image and that of Australia's best place to work. When it comes to training, opportunities for career development and grooming first time managers, they are nowhere to be found.

This is a place where people openly attack each other in public forums. If you do not write blogs, you will not be noticed. If you do write blogs, be prepared to have your work ripped apart and your intelligence questioned. If you are nondeveloper, expect this at ten times the frequency. And this is all in the name of open company, no BS.

Employees act entitled and culture encourages them to compete for attention. People voice grumbles about small things on company forums so that everyone can see and join in. The cheese variety isnt enough, the lunch isnt free, the perks in some other location or different company are so much better. It goes on and on.

Company is too focused on what the competition is doing rather than thinking about true innovation. Focus shifts often and people are moved around without consent. Be prepared to be a cog in a wheel.

I wholeheartedly agree with the comments around ‘Management’. Why this company has the layers of management it does is beyond me. “Heads of Departments” are not interested in fostering the careers of people they hire. So unless you’re ready to pilot a plane on the first day of flight school, move along to your next job and save yourself the anguish.

The offices while central are overcrowded. The company is littered with cliques…mainly older boys whole like to play Dungeons & Dragons and are persuaded by free beer & pizza to properly appreciate the lack of actual career development opportunities taking place.

The company is on a fast track of growth and everything centers on when the company will list in the UK and finally crystallize the large reward that the co-founders are due (and have probably earned).

Every other ‘manager’ (I use this word loosely) closely monitors their employee share growth and are too engrossed in their future reward to even notice the new employees they have hired.

This applies to finance/tax/HR and payroll too and is not limited to the operations side.

Really good people are constantly leaving…the place is a revolving door or new starters leaving because of a lack of direction and older employees taking the winnings of their employee shares and starting a ‘new life’ at some place more organised.

Don’t join this company if you want a ‘career’…it’s an illusion. When you peel back the thin veneer that is the free cheap thrills that are thrown your way to distract you from improving your career attributes, you realize you have pretty much landed in a child care center for little boys that failed to grow up.

All manager level employees (I.e. people who have the responsibility of other employee careers in their hands) should be made redundant as their purpose is really to serve themselves.

HR should not be allowed to call themselves ‘Human’ because they are clearly devoid of any attributes to draw that long conclusion. At best it's a talent Acquisition department, which can find talent but has no idea on how to properly hang onto that talent once they are in the door.

At the end of the day this is a career limiting environment which is spruced up by constantly having cheap thrills thrown at you. As they say, a pig with lipstick is still a pig and it doesn't matter how much freebies are thrown in your direction, its a career dead end.

All while the founding members plan their retirement funds (via public listing) and ego overweight lazy ‘Heads of Departments’ stare at the rapid rate of growth in their stock options neglecting the careers of those they hired to do their heavy lifting. Observing the 'Head's of Departments' trying to 'manage' their new hires is akin to watching a spider crawl out of a toilet.","Either train your managers in the art of 'management' or don't have them.
It's not an excuse for managers to say they are too busy to help with assimilating and acclimatizing new employees. In fact, this is very selfish and short sighted.
Good luck to Scott & Mike who have no doubt earned their wealth. The same can't be said of the selfish department heads with their snouts in the trough mentality.",2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0

Everything happens via Wiki (of course Confluence) and believe me, it's a real benefit. So easy to find content and people who can help you in any area.","Due to the growth many people have become managers who has no clue about people management and trying just to do micro management in every aspect. Their ego seems to be driving people crazy and resulting in people quitting jobs. Lateral hires who have no clue about software and just having management experience are trying to build teams. That's going to fail. Using authority for decisions only build resistance towards decisions.
Absolutely no way to switch roles even though there are lot of lateral hires coming in just because they have a big brand in their resume.
Salary was pathetic as the brand value of Atlassian is expected to keep the employees happy.
Regarding other perks, how many beers, pizzas and candies can you eat in a day to compensate for that?
While developers were being paid less, we had a team for QA (whose role I have never understood till now) who were being paid a hefty salary which used to de-motivate all of us.

It's no more a startup, so hierarchical that I wonder how such a small company can have 6 levels of reporting for 600 employees, while big MNCs with thousands of employees are able to manage with 5-6 reporting levels.

But having said all these, I would still say Atlassian is good place to in.","Take some serious note of the talent team there and the middle management. Evaluate managers, if they are really holding on the company values. Usage of authority and delegating everything down and complaining incompetency as higher management decisions is not what a middle manager is supposed to do.
Also think about getting rid of that talent crowd there. They are only good for tweeting the canteen and candy pictures, befriending other engineers and managers as their partners to stick on to their jobs.",3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

I come into work every day looking forward to it, and my colleagues are also my friends. The company lives its 5 values every day in everything it does. The work is challenging and interesting, there are great perks and events, and I feel like Atlassian cares about its staff which makes for a low attrition rate.

Atlassian learns from its mistakes, and although you can feel the bureaucracy creeping in as it grows from being a startup to a mid-size global company, I feel like there has been a lot of progress in the last year to address some of the problems addressed in other reviews.

The work/life balance is exceptional, better than any other company I've seen. People are actively encouraged to take time off and not stress or work outside regular hours to prevent burnout. Atlassian recognises that hiring and training people is an expensive and time consuming exercise, so it tries to keep its staff happy.","Sometimes it feels like management is comprised of a lot external hires who don't get the company culture. However it's definitely getting better as these people start to fit in.

A lot of Atlassian's products are very old with legacy code bases, and some teams move very slowly especially with people constraints. This can be annoying when you want to ship awesome stuff to customers frequently.

The perks are fun and frequent, but there could be more attention to detail to the office environment. Atlassian spends a lot less than other tech companies per square meter on office fitout, which means our offices don't have as many features you might get elsewhere.","On the whole, keep doing what you're doing.

- No interest in career development, or appropriately matching roles to your skills, experience and interests.
- It has made a big deal about its edgy corporate values, which were very true at the time they were formulated, but they don't seem to mean much to new senior management.
- Definitely not an inclusive employer. Has been called out as being hostile to women on a number of occasions.
- The HR (""Talent"") department is almost entirely concerned with recruitment and self-promotion and is incredibly under-resourced to do anything else, even by their own admission. The company is suffering in a number of respects as a result.
- An ineffectual and often damaging performance management process.
- Some other very dubious HR practices.
- Basic office facilities suck. Most employees just get a desk and a chair, no drawers or anything else.","- Step back from so aggressively promoting yourself as a great employer, and remember a time when you used to be one, without being so self-conscious about it.
- Understand that your people are infinitely more interested in a fulfilling career and a supportive environment than they are in free beer and snacks.
- Put a competent and properly resourced HR function in place.
- Step away from the ""bobbleheads"" (senior management) and get back in touch with your people.",2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

- Very smart people to work with
- Given independence in the tools that I can work with
- So much perks like foods and beers
- So much social activities, like Melbourne cup and EOFY parties.","- Can get left behind by everyone if you don't blog regularly. No one will notice you're there.
- They claim that they're an open company - but there are so many secrets. Some people are kept in the dark about things they want to know.
- Management not interested in career development - very hard to move to another position that you're more interested in. They'd rather hire new people.","- Listen to what your employers want, rather than aggressively hiring such a lot of people from all over the world, look at what you have right now.

Projects are generally well communicated through internal systems and there is a really good office environment and culture.,"Management is bloated and objectives are unclear and often changing. As the company grows, it needs to learn how to better empower employees to make decisions on their own without having to funnel everything to upper management.

Advancement opportunities are limited/non-existent for those not in technical divisions.

The company also has a general policy of hiring from outside instead of promoting from within, leading to career development stagnation.","Remember your values.
