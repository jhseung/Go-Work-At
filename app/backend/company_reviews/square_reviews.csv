- Great paternity / maternity leave program. 4 paid months off!

- Super transparent company culture. Every other Friday we have a company wide meeting (with different fine wine and appetizer pairings), where different groups discuss what they’re working on, where Jack Dorsey himself engages with his Squares, and listens to us voice our grievances, whether professional or personal opinions, (and he does so with great compassion and concern for all).

- CEO is a saint. God bless him for all he does and continues to do for his employees and for the rest of the world. He believes very strongly in being humble and letting the results speak for themselves. It may be why we don’t spend so much money on trying to be ranked the best place to work.

There's very little opportunity to advance into a career outside of the support environment. typically, support is a stepping stone towards other career paths, but there's little to no room for mobility aside from being a support manager or resolution specialist (tackling escalated cases).
- Difficult to support other products of Square when they don't have a customer facing team/direct transfer for incoming calls. I.e. Employee Management, Capital, Cash. Supporters are expected to have knowledge of multiple product areas so it does get difficult when there's new features/bugs in the platform/product requests/etc. since there's no clear escalation path in place
- The nature of support is 24/7. You are meant to serve the customers and with that in mind, expect to work holidays. When other employees get a week in between Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, you're more than likely working. Though you get to work from home, it's unfortunate having to be locked up in a room taking calls while the rest of your family enjoys the holiday.
- Growing pains = culture is difficult to maintain with rapid growth
- Little diversity in the certain product areas and it does get cliquey.",Please take a deep dive into company culture and inclusion within each department/product. Culture is fostered within these smaller product areas and some could use more help than others. Please also give support more recognition.

 Office is very convenient for public transit and there is parking .
A lot of projects for engineers are interesting and fun.","More than any company I have ever worked at Sqare is like high school. Most decisions are based on who you ate with at lunch.
 Managers will openly and publicly mock draft reports. I have literally seen someone stand behind the person speaking and mime inappropriate things.
 80% of the managers are completely incompetent.
Many project managers have never managed anything and give engineers nothing useful to work with.
 With nearly all operation staff on contract half of your time on call is spent dealing with information they put into the system wrong.
The only people who stay long enough to have any understanding of how stuff works are on work visas or 22-year-olds read on the interned with Sqare. No one else lasts more than a year. This makes things like tax season absolute chaos as no one has seen it before and there is no documentation.

-Good benefits.
-Decent starting pay, not great, but decent.
-Solid product.
-Depending on team, good work/life balance.
-Looks good on resume- can be easy to move to other companies.","-Support has become your typical call center environment. Used to be a department I would suggest to friends looking for a new career but at this point I wouldn't suggest it to anyone, especially in the San Francisco office.
-Support is a dead-end. There are very few positions where you're not customer-facing and getting yelled at by merchants. Managers treat any movement away from Support as if it's career growth, but amongst peers its treated like an escape from a toxic environment.
-Your work will not feel valued. Management gives lip-service indicating they value it, but unwilling to actually show it in any meaningful way. Frequent reminders that you are replaceable. There is a constant cycle of people leaving after a year or two because they feel undervalued and stuck, then being replaced by a new batch of people who have to be trained up all over again.
-Over-emphasis on metrics and numbers by management leads to a team that is under-trained and pushed way too hard.
-Leads both manage people and do project work- good in theory, but in reality each is only good at one or the other. Some leads just do not have the temperament to manage actual human beings and this can be soul crushing.
-Various teams both within Support and outside Support are siloed off and rarely are on the same page. Lack of cross-team operational positions means inter-team communication and collaboration is very poor.
-Trying to move to a new position is so ""hands-off"" that it feels like a complete crapshoot- you're expected to find new roles on your own and just apply, but you have no insight into whether you'd be a good fit. You may end up having to apply to a half a dozen completely unrelated positions before landing something.
-Very slow to create new roles that are needed, instead key duties often distributed among a large group of people who are usually uninterested/uninvested in said work.
-Your role may change so dramatically overnight that it feels like a demotion. Likewise, you may be asked to interview for a role you've already been doing for a long period of time.
-Shared resources and tools have no ownership, so once whoever created the tool or resource leaves it gets no attention and eventually falls apart.
-Upper management is very tone-deaf and completely very disconnected from work that customer facing teams are doing.
-Management very bad at taking feedback- your feedback for leads is often turned around into a criticism of yourself. Frequent response you will here in response to feedback given to management is ""maybe this isn't the place for you"".
-Decisions are made by people who are not involved in work being done without consulting people who ARE doing the work.","-Create additional operational and specialist positions as needed, not 3 years later.
-Do not try to distribute key responsibilities amongst a large group of uninterested people.
-Reward high performers and tenured employees.
-You can't keep putting off improving tools and documentation in hopes you'll find the perfect solution. Invest in these things today in a significant and forward thinking way, not by making reactive half-assed ad-hoc attempts when the problems boil over.
-You wouldn't have to spend so much time and money training people if you made any effort to retain talent.
-Your employees are not leaving for reasons that reflect well on your team or the company- they are leaving because the team is dysfunctional and the job sucks. Do not assume they are leaving to pursue better things.
-Until you improve the above you will never be a ""world-class"" Support team, nor will you provide ""world-class"" support. Your actions and inactions are making hundreds of people unhappy.",2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

The speed of change sparks affords new opportunities on a very regular basis. Even as the company has grown and gone public, the culture is still very horizontal and executives and higher level managers are still very approachable and open to new ideas. Perks are great - flexible vacation policy, good food in the office, plenty of snacks, coffee bar, and a beautiful office.

The CEO has strong morale convictions and this clearly guides his leadership. It's very refreshing to have someone this authentic heading the company who speaks their actual opinion about social issues. Even when I don't agree with him, it's nice to know it's actually his opinion (opposed to something his legal team drafted up).","A lot of these issues have been fixed, but due to the rapid growth there are still some systems issues and managers that are in over their heads. Most of these Managers have been replaced (or moved to a more appropriate level), but some remain in higher level positions who lack the necessary experience in critical areas which is still causing some pain. The HR team is understaffed so they are not in a position to offer much support, but this is currently being addressed.

The CEO's political beliefs create a somewhat insular environment, though I'm sure most tech companies are like this. It would be a challenging place for someone with conservative political views to work at.","- If the company is going to pride itself on creating an office environment where political/social issues are discussed, ensure it's true discussion of opposing view points opposed to just patting each other on the back for believing the same thing.
- Invest in the HR team, particularly in higher level leadership. I don't think it's wise to have the same executive leading the Capital Program and HR team.

Also there really isn't a lot of transparency in regards to upward mobility. Tons of possibilities are discussed but the odds of moving up are pretty slim, especially in a supporting role. The work for a supporter as to be expected is highly repetitive and can wear you down pretty quickly.

2016-11-18,,,Former Employee ,Seemed good as long as you're not in Support,,0,"Square is very perk-oriented. The company has a great energy about it, with leaders always sporting positive attitudes. It is a very casual environment where employees can relax (until they begin work).","The positive attitude didn't have much (if any) substance behind it, and that especially goes for Support. The brunt of the company's changes were placed on the Support team, with very little information or assistance in even the biggest company changes. It is very much a chained-to-your-desk environment, where even a longer trip to the restroom is heavily questioned. Unlimited PTO becomes less of a perk and more of an onus when leaders speak critically toward employees wanting a vacation.

Things move very quickly there, and not always in a good way. The Support team is expected to balance dozens of products with hundreds of features and is pulled in conflicting directions: keep someone on the phone while you investigate a messy issue, but don't let your call run long; we don't have a script, but we do have a very strict template of what you should be saying. Support employees have very little control over their situations, their days, and their growth within the company.

Arguably the worst part was that it was not like this at the beginning of my time at the company, but the leadership placed an emphasis only on quantifiable data rather than on our customers — a bad sign for a company claiming to be all about its users.

This is a company I had expected to stay with for a number of years, but I left as soon as I saw the direction it was heading.","Putting a happy face over a bad situation doesn't make it a good one. Senior support leadership needs to return to its customer-centric (as opposed to data-centric) focus, as human interactions and true service can never be thoroughly quantified. You can only put so much weight on employees until they break, and employees can tell when your caring is a farce.",3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

* The food is about as good as it gets. We get spoiled.

Anyone that has spent time at a larger company would marvel at how gracefully Square has made the transition to being as big as it is.

If you don't drink the kool-aid, you're gone.

Management refuses to admit mistakes. The communications team seems to focus on placating employees, not telling an inspiring narrative to the rest of the world.

Generally, projects move at a glacial pace unless management happens to fancy your project this quarter. The next quarter your headcount could be gone. I saw projects take two years that should have taken 3-6 months.

Compensation is unimpressive. I think there's more of an effort recently to improve it, but for many employees like myself it's too little too late.

For as many great engineers as there are, there are equally as many really poor engineers. Square grew far too quickly, and its talent suffered as a result.

- Friendly staff","- Google Square and you'll see it is rated 2 stars, and for the same complaints that it's merchants have is the a problem that is not getting resolved through the eyes of an employee the turnover rate is huge because they hire on contingent workers with low pay and do not offer upward mobility unless you are white/gay. This company hugely discriminates! Yes you will see a couple specs of minorities around the building but they either work as a janitor or a contingent worker never anything more. So as far as career opportunities there are none.

- Square has treated me and my colleagues as if we are invisible. I have no idea who my supervisor is and that is sad.

- For the past several months my team has been getting paid to sit here. It may seem like a fun job to sit and do nothing but not when it messes with the overall productivity of the company.",Hire more people on so you have phone support.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,
2016-03-27,,,Former Employee ,A Chaotic Mess,,0,"- Gorgeous office and great benefits including fully paid health, dental, and vision
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner five days a week
- Incredibly generous vacation policy if you're on your lead's good side
- Most of the company genuinely believes in the mission to enable small and mid-sized businesses to succeed and grow
- Numerous showcases for Square merchants and high-profile speakers who regularly stop by to share their stories
- The security and kitchen staff are incredibly down to earth which is refreshing in this industry","- Absurdly unnecessary “perks” that bloat operating expenses. $40 designer plates, a made to order smoothie bar AND separate coffee bar, full Wise Sons deli, and robots you can remotely drive around the office with your face plastered up on a screen in google hangouts weirding everyone out. They also recently brought in a full mariachi band to parade around the office as well as a cotton candy station and magician. All completely necessary when you’re on track to lose north of $80 million in one quarter (this is public information).

- The amount of tech entitlement in San Francisco that you’ve heard about is alive and well here. There was a ridiculous debate concerning the cafeteria's pre-planned closures two days out of the month. Some argued that it was completely unacceptable because 30 minutes spent to go out and get lunch was 30 minutes lost with family or productivity. Ever heard of packing a lunch the night before? How about ordering from the food delivery service your company just acquired for 90 million dollars?

- The company is extremely divided and headed in a million different directions but doesn’t seem to care that it's affecting its bottom line and employee morale. Payments? Register? Capital? Cash? Caviar? Invoices? Appointments? Payroll? Employee Management? Marketing? Remember Wallet and Order? Ask any of your friends or family what Square does and they’ll say, ""Um that credit card dongle thing right?"" Yet everyone has convinced themselves that we’re known for “more than just our reader."" The epitome of biting off more than you can chew.

- Massive attrition. Don’t be surprised to see scores of paperwork and candidates spilling out of the interview rooms. It’s almost a guarantee that the position you’ve applied for was recently vacated and needs to be filled immediately, resulting in a rushed interview process that devalues candidates. But of course they won’t tell you that. If you do interview in person, you can judge the sense of panic for yourself.

- Combine all of this with extremely poor compensation relative to industry standards, atrocious middle management, limited growth opportunities, and a “culture” that seems more like a freshman high school mixer, you can clearly see why they’re struggling to mitigate the massive amount of turnover in all departments.

And while you’re at it, google “Square IPO ratchet” and see who’s really benefiting from the ill-timed IPO.

Square says its mission is to empower its sellers, yet it has mightily failed to empower its own employees.","- At Square, no one is ever wrong, even if they’re wrong 25 times in a row. Repeatedly fail to spot massive fraudulent charges? Ship a bug riddled build that affects thousands of buyers and sellers? Oh well, because it’s never anyone’s fault lest we hurt someone’s feelings. There is an unspoken rule prohibiting the assignment of any sort of blame or responsibility and you will be ostracized the second you break rank and attempt to. TAKE ACTION and fire the people who are coasting or not living up to their job duties.

- Pay people what they're entitled to rather than feeding them empty lines about how they're changing the world, you're still a fledgling startup and that ""all things take time.""

- Focus on consolidating your products and services and playing to your strengths. Quality over quantity isn't a new concept.

- Get rid of middle managers and leads who can't lead and have no prior experience doing so. They bring down team morale and alienate those who are trying to actually get things done.",1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

-Some very smart and talented people
-Big comfy office with lots of space
-The core products are still very strong and growing very fast
-Works hard on diversity and other ethical challenges","-People are added to the middle pretty consistently. That is, it's becoming more and more likely to see your role effectively demoted because they decide to add a level of management between you and your boss, or boss's boss, etc.
-Decisions are now mostly by committee. In Square's earlier history, decisions were generally made quickly by informed leaders. Today, processes are much, much slower and the company is becoming less nimble.
-Burned by the IPO. Many employees at Square, especially members of our Finance Team, took substantial pay cuts to work for Square -- sometimes in excess of 50% -- under the promise that there would be a big IPO someday and we'd make up that loss in stock. However, with the substantial cut in Square's valuation, many employees have stock option grants that are entirely in the red. To make up for these losses, the company issued one time RSU grants to older employees who might have been burned. My RSU grant was the equivalent of a 7.5% salary bonus, which takes a year to vest and will be taxed as income.
-The transparency that Square used to treasure is disappearing. It used to be that there was no product or financial plan that wasn't shared among employees. Today, a combination of unplanned leaks to the press and the demands of being a public company have ended a lot of that transparency.
-Out of touch leadership. Jack is a very inspiring leader and has an excellent understanding of design and usability. However, his conviction of being a visionary contradicts current market forces.
-Lack of career mobility. Square is very proud of its ""go/grow"" and ""go/careers"" programs which purportedly allow employees to find new roles at the company if they feel they're not developing in their career. However, very few employees are promoted at Square, particularly on the Finance and Business teams.
-Apparently Square is perfect? It's very rare for Square to admit something didn't go well or it made a mistake. The policy seems to be to just let the problem disappear and hope nobody asks about it. Products are often launched and then shifted permanently to the back burner. Metrics post-launch are rarely checked and very few financial resources are oriented towards product launches.
-Dead weight remains. People who are under-performing or are becoming caustic to the organization are very, very rarely fired and only occasionally mitigated. On the few occasions someone is fired or mitigated, of the person who replaces them is just as bad, they let that person stay in role indefinitely rather than embarrass themselves twice and have to hire for the role a third time.","You have serious organizational structure and behavior issues on your hands.

2014-12-14, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Misdirected Talent,More than a year,0,"If you're someone who likes to read management or business case studies, Square serves as a terrific example of how not to operate in several key areas: how not to manage projects, how not to manage people and retain great employees, and how not to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive payments landscape.

The sole area of excellence is the San Francisco office's cafeteria, which is on par with a fine restaurant.","Introduction

Square started with a fantastic product: the iconic Square Reader, which may still be the best designed, most reliable credit card reader device for mobile devices. Unfortunately, like many companies that start small and focused, they lack the managerial focus to become a standout performer.

As my title suggests, the story of Square boils down to this: it's a case study in misdirected talent.

And talent there is: Square boasts some great industry minds (as some of the more benevolent reviews suggest.) However, it is my view and my personal experience that winning product strategies, focused execution, and experienced management can succeed with merely ""good"" talent, while no amount of talent can rescue a company devoid of the other elements. Do they really fall down in those areas? Let's examine each notion in turn:

* Product Strategies: an Uphill Battle *

Virtually all of Square's low-or-no-margin payment businesses (mobile Reader,Square Register, Cash, etc.) face enormous competition from both entrenched competitors and more focused upstarts. Although it is the opinion of the author that the Reader product is the best in the business, the ugly truth may be (much to the dismay of their meticulous designers) that margins matter more to customers than design, and in this area, they will be driven to the dirt by Amazon and others.

* Inefficient Execution *

It's hard to quantify execution capability. From the perspective of the author, however, I would say that I have seen much more accomplished, by fewer (less talented) people, in less time. The reason this is true is that the rank-and-file engineer at Square has little industry experience, and many managers have no prior experience managing people. (This is discussed below.)

* Poor Management *

Past Glassdoor reviews (some of which seem to have disappeared) mentioned chaotic, Twitter-like management, replete with disorienting reorganizations. This is still the case. While there is significant talent at the senior level, the middle management is rife with inexperienced young people who have never managed others at all, many of whom were promoted due to their perceived engineering ability.

This has led to several situations that would be hilarious if they weren't so sad: Lack of clear ownership of major functionality, huge variability of code quality across teams, borderline-hostile code reviews, poor training, humiliating and unprofessional behavior in meetings, bad technology choices, and so on.

Conclusion

Despite the hype, talent, and early success of the Reader product, and despite the purported sky-high valuation (which makes no sense when compared to industry comps), Square is no longer a horse worth betting on. With a product portfolio consisting of low or no margin businesses, its apparent lack of focus and efficiency, and terrible management all add up to a company whose drawbacks far exceed potential benefits.

Recent college graduates should realize that the company is no longer a start-up; you're joining a medium sized firm that's still struggling to find its way in a sea of competitors. If you're talented enough, you'd be better off trying for Google or another quality big firm to shore up your skills, and THEN move to a start-up.

The situation is even worse for experienced hires: compensation won't match what a skilled engineer can earn elsewhere, with far less hassle, and more prospects for growth. You're also likely to face a bait-and-switch when it comes to your position and duties, as well as the aforementioned issues with bad management.

At the end of the day, while probably not a sinking ship, Square is idling at port, bobbling listlessly while the smartest rats scurry down the mooring lines for the relative safety of the rotting boards of the dock.","Find a high margin strategy that offers true product differentiation, and stick to it.

Everyone is great here and Square always makes sure there's something to look forward to- the Town Square company-wide meetings are awesome and fun to see what's happening around the company.

Whether you want to focus on one area or contribute to project across the board, Square is a great place to work! My peers are amazingly talented. I think I have a good work-life balance.

We also have a culture of pair-coding, which I think is great. It prevents procrastination, encourages the exchange of skills, and helps ensure more than one person is really familiar with the codebase.

I feel like I can approach him and question how decisions were made, or why we do things the way we do.","The sub-levels of leadership are awful. Some orgs are run with no care for the employees, but rather driven by data. Some orgs are managed haphazardly, and with no transparency whatsoever. Managers are leading groups of people, without knowledge or understanding of the work they ask their employees to do on a day-to-day basis. This has led to zero trust and high levels of frustration. How can one be considered successful in the eyes of a manager with no context for success? My boss only ""knows"" I'm doing well when he hears it from others, but does not seek it out, nor give me the benefit of the doubt when approached with feedback.","Make the hard decisions, cut the fat and get rid of the people who are more problematic than they are valuable.

It is a collaborative environment so it might be a better fit if you enjoy working closely with other people than if you prefer to sequester yourself with a problem and solve it on your own.","Although the general management and prioritization situation has gotten better with a few really good executive hires, there are still things which fall through the cracks given shifting priorities (which up to a point is desirable), re-orgs, and an emphasis on building new things (keeping existing things running does happen, but isn't planned for by management in the same way).","Focus on the tier of management between the executives and the individual contributors. Many of these people are promoted from individual contributor roles (at least in engineering), which is not a problem, but do focus on what these frontline managers need to be successful (skills, organizational support, good ways of making decisions with each other and higher-ups, etc).

I love being in a challenging environment, and everyone is smart and passionate about our work as a company. I've never experienced such personal connection with previous employers, and I love working at a place where we all truly believe in our work, and share the goal of making commerce easy for everyone.

Offices are a little sterile, but very nice. Great benefits and perks (especially if you like coffee, smoothies or free food).

Transparency is excellent. It's refreshing to know what our finances look like, what's on the product roadmap and why decisions are made. It helps promote accountability and gives me the information I need to do my job.

Getting time off is as easy as chatting with your manager - typically no questions asked. The food program is amazing with very high-quality comped breakfast/lunch/dinner. Rapid growth translates to continuous learning opportunities and a work environment that never gets boring. As an engineer - the learning opportunities never end!","Any ""cons"" need to be prefaced with this: remember that Square is an extremely rapidly growing company that feels like a whole new workplace every 6 months. I've tried to only list the more consistent or recurring cons here, but all of them are consistently trending positively (or I wouldn't be working here anymore, really!). Any of these cons could be gone in a month or two, or replaced with new ones. There's just no way to know!

That said:
- Immature leadership has been an ongoing theme for my entire tenure. It's been a problem at every level of leadership from executive on down at some point or another. On the other hand - I think this is to be expected of a company this age and size, and is usually course-corrected eventually.
- Immature HR (incl. compensation adjustment and talent review). First iterations of talent review were downright insulting: we were rated by shape (circle, square, or star) like kindergardeners. Luckily we acknowledged that was a horrible idea and have never done it again - but our cadence of performance feedback has remained random at best. Same goes for cadence of compensation adjustment. If you get a job here - NEGOTIATE UP FRONT - there's no telling how many months or years it might be until someone thinks to themselves ""oh maybe we should look at comp again!"". Note: this situation has already improved immensely with the introduction of a consistent engineering ranking/ladder system - if we manage to keep it more than a year, that is.
- Rampant politics and personal agendas. To be expected at any growing company. We have them too. Nothing special to see here, move along.
- Oncall policies. No overtime pay for brutalizing oncall shifts are the norm. No compensation for personal phone use either. Occasionally you'll get a ""thank you"" from someone.
- Not enough bathrooms. Not kidding. Try and find a free stall or urinal sometime after lunch. Good luck!","Keep doing what you're doing. Really. I mean it.

New strategies and products are shown early and often. A huge amount of trust is placed in each of us to keep these secrets but it's incredibly empowering and can even spark new ideas across the company.
- Challenging the status quo. Square is growing and iterating extremely fast. Old processes are quickly questioned and replaced if they get in the way. Employees are encouraged to ask the senior staff anything they want during our weekly ""Town Hall"" on Fridays.
- Tons of autonomy. Individually, employees have the latitude to work when they want, how they want. Some people get in past 11am & stay later while some work typical 9-5 hours.

Very high quality work is produced by this company. Design is always paramount and on point. Awesome coffee.,"Business practices: Square leverages its name to their advantage and to the disadvantage of everyone else. This is manifested in poor compensation for all people outside of engineering and getting out of paying for recruiting and / or sponsorship privileges for their brand. Contractors are treated as second class citizens and must be willing to work for very little pay. Full time roles are advertised as available but I know for a fact there was never headcount to begin with. All this makes the company seem disingenuous as they are constantly trying to convince people that they're the ""good guys"" in merchant services.

Business health: Cost cutting is apparent throughout the organization (not that this is a bad management style, but it seems to be a signal something more). Sometimes it feels like some people are shoving the proverbial company ""kool-aid"" down people's throats; I think anyone with a discerning eye knows what's going on.

Working environment: The company is large now so there is a lot of red tape and channel conflict. Be prepared to manoeuvre a highly political environment. Your experience largely depends on your team and manager (like every other corporate) and culture is obviously much less cohesive than at smaller companies. Tricky thing is even if you get onto a great team, I guarantee that team will not stay that way long.

Churn is very high at this company (for many reasons) so don't count on anyone sticking around for very long. 4 months in and you're considered a veteran! Most people come in and realize it's only a stepping stone.

There are lots of intelligent people here; most are not humble. There are also lots of ambitious people here but they're more likely to push you down than help you up.
