I would respond to that by saying that I have worked at many different companies and left jobs for a myriad of reasons. I have never written anything even remotely similar to this about any of my former employers because I have never experienced anything like my time there.
I worked for a company that was purchased by “B&D” in the early 2000s. Within weeks of this acquisition, the writing was clearly written on the veritable wall(s). The following realities became stark early on:
- No relevant decisions are made outside of the boundaries of the HQ located in Towson, MD
- Smaller companies that are absorbed by B&D will quickly find themselves in lockstep with their toxic and inequitable human resource practices and policies
- Black and Decker fosters a self-serving, predatory culture void of anything resembling a work-life balance
- Upper-echelons couldn't care less about the well-being of subordinate employees or their families
- Leadership is unscrupulous, aloof and indifferent toward the workforce in general
- The singular intent of the company is to leverage contrived brand strengths in the hopes of pushing their products upon the unknowing masses
- Their marketing stratagem is a broad-stroke, uninspired and cost-driven approach
- The actual quality of the tangible products is a nonfactor as it relates to their target market(s)
- Their sales force consists mostly of recent college graduates hired on the basis of their physical energy levels and perceived abilities to adhere to market-push methodologies
- Middle management consists almost exclusively of fear-inspired, overworked and largely ineffective “seat-warmers”
- “Burnout” runs rampant throughout the caste system that permeates the entire company
In summary, in a failed national economic state, this company is an iconic manifestation representing the complete avoidance model for potential job-seekers. If you are considering any type of employment there you need to view your prospective tenure as a temporary and painful learning experience. As such, you will learn everything you do not want to be as an employee or a person for that matter. Better companies can most assuredly benefit from your experiences.","Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the main goal of the leader is to serve. This is different from traditional leadership where the leader's main focus is the thriving of their company or organizations.

Forklift drivers are hired through a temp. agencies at first: Strataforce and Kelly. Depending on how much you suck up to your group leaders and supervisors, you can be hired on full time by B&D after 6 months or 3 years. I am not kidding.

NOBODY get's two 15 min. breaks ever, only one 20 min. lunch, which is HIGLEY illegal but management could care less. There is no smoking area on the premises after 2016. Group leaders show favoritism to employees (usually the laziest and most talkative ones too) while other hard working employees have to pick up their slack and are asked to stay late/work extra shifts.

Don't want to or can't because your son has soccer practice? Too bad! That's +1 point against you. They will tell you to suck it up or they'll find someone who can.

Career Growth:
There seems to be a lot of opportunity for everyone in general - there's always jobs available and people get promoted often. I cannot say I see it happen in HR though...

Employee Groups:
SBD has finally hopped onto the diversity and inclusion train with the Women's Network, African Ancestry Network, and hopefully soon a LGBTQ group or even an Asian Network. The company is finally coming up last in the race and now it just needs to finish strong by normalizing these groups.

I can't really think of any more pros because I am honestly burned out... I tried though.","There is no work-life balance. In the beginning there was and at very short stints between; but I am working nearly as much as I was at my old employer; which was the reason I left there and got paid more money to be nearly as miserable. At this point, I am convinced that Corporate America burns people out as quickly as they can; so I am trying to find a loving start up or untraditional technology organization to work for. At least there I would have the benefits, compensation, and perks. There are no policies about work-life balance in place and I doubt one with breadth will ever generate; it is all verbal which means there is no guarantee.

Managers need training on how to be an inspiring, just, and transformational leader. There are terrible managers in place who have driven their talent away; and the company keeps them because they are scared they won't find anyone else like them. Please! Let them go. Listen to the direct reports; surely all of them are not conspiring against their manager.

Layoffs or not filling roles seem to be everywhere and it is depressing - ask about EXL. It is a terrible work environment waiting on the day one's job will be over with. The morale is gone and I don't think any kind of award or happy hour will bring it back.

In the midst of uncertainty, the communication about the direction of the business is nonexistent. People don't know what is going on but are certain that EXL will eliminate several jobs once projects and initiatives are complete. It is like being on the Titanic (SBD) when the passengers (employees) knew the ship started to fill with water (EXL) but are waiting to see if they want to jump ship (leave SBD) or not (stay until they are terminated).

People are tapped on the shoulder way too much here and they do not even bother to post a role for everyone to have a chance. Even then, a candidate is already identified. It really makes me believe that you can work hard, better yourself professionally and be forgotten; no matter what you do. Nothing makes me believe that I will ever be an executive because of this behind-the-scenes behavior that is rampant at SBD.

This company is SO behind on letting systems make life easier! Mass uploads into every system should be a thing. Accurate data from systems should be a thing. Pulling hundreds of different reports with a few clicks should be a thing. Data integrity should be a thing. I am fed up with this.","Remain steadfast and become more aggressive about changing SBD's culture. In terms of large, traditional conglomerates; I do believe we are ahead but definitely not that much - especially when it comes to the affinity groups which many companies have had for years and/or decades! If culture change and diversity really matter, invest in a department to lead this; and not doubling it up into HR or Communications. I believe if we try, we could be as sought after by the best talent in the world as the ""cool"" tech companies. We really need to be smarter about this because at that point, we would not have to recruit - it would all just flow through the door.

Clip spending elsewhere and throw it into the tuition reimbursement program. This company is too large to just offer the federal maximum. There's a company right down the street from New Britain that pays for everything down to the pencil. How could you let your talent in search of higher learning get away like that? Many millennials and Gen-Xers are buried in student loan debt and/or would love to get their masters. Going ""across the street"" would be a no brainer to this population; especially since that employer compensates more.

2 weeks of PTO is not enough; especially since we don't have sick or personal time. Everyone needs to start at 3 and work their way up.

Can we please get rid of Wells Fargo for our retirement plan already? How could you stay with them after their irresponsibility last year?

There are probably more, but I can't seem to recall at this time.","During 2016, the operations department worked on 38 Saturdays with no extra pay/compensation. While operations works on Saturdays (and occasional Sunday) office personnel do not come in (HR, accounting, ISO, clerks, etc.).I genuinely felt that there was no appreciation for the work performed. In all, I had 87 associates to manage in 5 departments, to include weekly Kronos audits for clocking punches, reviews for full time SBD employees, conduct Lean/6-Sigma events, manage temp agency hired associates, assess weekly production efficiency on each associate, and conduct counseling/corrective actions on. The HR department was slow to respond or to provide guidance on corrective actions, information for floor associates, etc. Iver the year I found that several of the supervisors (my peers) would pick and chose which rules in the Employee Hand Book to enforce and follow and in general some in the management areas had favorites who were not held accountable for transgressions/violations. A real clickish atmosphere existed at the FMDC plant. I did not feel like the supervisors were on the same team--1st shift does not support or set 2nd shift up for success, 2nd shift does not support or set 3rd shift up for success, 3rd shift does not support or set 1st shift up for success. There was a lot of passing the buck from other managers outside of operations giving information and tasking for the supervisors to manage and do the leg work. HR, ISO, and others would frequently schedule meetings for me to attend during off shift hours. The safety department and ISO department were reactionary. When an inspector was coming to the plant, these were important areas, but other than that they were just words, badges, ""nod your head and agree"" points. In total, I genuinely felt that because I had not been working in the facility for 5+ years, that my input was not valued or desired. I started to get a bad attitude because of this and adopted a ""Save Your Breath"" mentality towards the job.","-If Operations works, all should work

They dont care you'll get points. 1 point for every occurrence. 8 points for a write up and you cant earn points back like most shops do you have to wait an entire year. In fact I know someone getting married and theyve already told him he will get points for taking a weekend to do it, but recently told a guy that they hired he can go hunting in october with no points. The turn over rate is so high due to the high demands they force on their people continuously, and they have lost good people to their Hitler like point system. My advice if you have a family, and love your family stay as far away from there as you can. Management is so disassociated from the production people they continually have monthly meetings to ask what needs improvement only to write it down and never actually fix anything. There is a ""union"" but its in the companies pocket so bad that that there was a fellow employee that was being targeted and the harassed by a supervisor so bad that you could physically see how it affected him. We convinced him to go to the union about it where he was told it is harassment, but dont do anything about it because it will only get worse, and just to ignore it.","Need to be better orginized.

President lacked foresight or ability to plan and prioritize workload of the team. For
example, when our contracted manufacturer ceased production of our product, there was no plan in place to keep production going at an alternate location even though we were informed of the shutdown months in advance. Result? Layoffs in year 2 of the business. President continually took on new projects that had little or nothing to do with increasing sales. For example, spent a huge amount of our limited budget on a low-exposure PR event that distracted the team from primary job functions and drained already-limited resources. Spent exorbitant amounts of time and money at useless conferences, on phone calls and in meetings that did not further company objectives (i.e. selling) in any way. Lots of activity, few results. Absolutely no real direction in terms of objectives that really mattered in terms of growing the business. Instead a lot of last minute projects that usually failed because President would wait till last minute to communicate them. And those projects usually didn't have any value in the first place. Again, huge amounts of wasted time and money.

President would frequently brush off members of his team on important business and personnel matters. Led to lack of confidence In his leadership and eventually a lack of cohesiveness and trust across the team, with several team members eventually leaving (which President tried to spin as them getting fired, leading to further mistrust). Not to mention, we still had no product to sell. Fortunately it appeared corporate leadership was privy to the fact that there were problems but still were unable - or unwilling - to uproot the problem and find a leader who knew how to prioritize, plan and make money.","Basic management training for leadership.

2016-04-01, Thread Roll Operator,"East Greenwich, RI",Former Employee ,Almost 20 years of my life was given to Stanley,Almost 20 years of my life was given to Stanley,0,"I started in1994 as a nail packer in East Greenwich RI. I quickly moved up the ranks and the pay was great, the hours were all I wanted, and I took them all. Working as much as 60-80 hours a week several times throughout my tenure. The mandatory hours were 55 a week. So plenty of work and best pay in RI compared to other companies. I moved up the ranks rather quickly and finally found a great fit for me as a Thread Roll operator/nail polisher. Awesome pay and benefits.","In 99' management decided it was more profitable to send our jobs to Mexico, China, and Poland. This devastated me and my new family, a month prior to closing on the new home I was purchasing. Luckily the TRA saved us from losing everything we had worked so hard for and for so long. Several years later Stanley had realized it wasn't the best move sending the products we made elsewhere. Eventually I got called back and faithfully I went back again as a thread roll operator, but I had to start over again at the bottom of the pay scale. A few years later after reaching the top of my scale they once again decided to close only this time the whole factory was going to Poland, China and Indiana. All this after a 10 million dollar investment in our location to update and expand the facilities to increase our potential growth, reduce costs and improve the overall image of the building itself. The biggest decision by far was the closing of our sister plant in Connecticut that drew the iron wire for our nails and staples. The entire process was moved to our location directly on site and was a huge part of that 10 million dollar fiasco to update and improve our facility and production line. We would no longer have to ship in the wire from CT. It was pulled down to size at our plant now and with that investment in our future we thought we would be set for years to come.... We couldn't have been more wrong.... we bet our lives upon it and lost.","Focus less on investors and the stock market price, and more on the people who work there, without them you would have no company to grow. Make ""Made in the U.S.A."" mean something again. Do those things and the stock price will take care of itself and your investors will be happy.
