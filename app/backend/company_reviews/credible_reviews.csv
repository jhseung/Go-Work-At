The HR and office team is amazing we are adding so much more benefits and doing more team gatherings to get to know people in other departments. It’s becoming a lot more fun to work there! I really enjoy the people that is by far the best part of this job. Everyone is very kind willing to help, always brings homemade food for everyone.

You have the opportunity to shadow other departments to gain skills or learn more.

We have happy hours on Fridays and themed office get togethers. Holiday party is awesome.

They company really values employees opinions and makes positive changes based on feedback.

It’s a pretty laid back company. You get free lunch on Wednesday. If you work hard you can be promoted/ create your own position. Most of the departments are recognized for their hard work.

Commuter benefits are good.","Has its typical growing pains, lots of changes all the time. So you must be ready and able to adapt. Not really a con if you can handle start ups.

I do believe customer service should be recognized way more. They aren’t able to participate in company activities. Those that work hard in that field aren’t promoted properly or it takes years even though you’ve been putting in the work.

Medical / dental benefits could be a lot better.","Keep working in the direction we are going! Doing a great job.

Disastrous dead end Customer Success job,Less than a year,0,"Nice spacious office in the Jackson square area , free lunch on Wednesdays, snacks, coffee, bagels on Fridays.... close to a few coffee shops","Zero opportunities for advancement. At the moment you finished the mediocre training they provide, you are stuck doing the same routine over and over and over.
Is amazing how the customer success leads do not even talk, greet and say anything to their employees, while they are micromanaging you listening to your calls. ( God forbid they pick up the phone! - they never ever do so how are they good evaluators if they do not do what you do?)
Hey treat their employees horribly. I have never felt more rejection ( is a sense among the whole team) at a company where the customer success team members are looked down like second class citizens because everybody else In other departments think they are so above everyone else and they have zero interest to even acknowledge you or interact with you.
TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK. ZERO ROOM FOR GROWTH. You perform the same list of calls over and over and respond to the chats like a robot. At some point, the job is so tedious that people fall asleep.
If you would like to be a robot, ignored by everyone in the company including your own mediocre team lead, apply at credible, you’ll regret it and will start calling out like everybody else because they hate the job.
Credible is such a terrible company that they pay two teams to basically execute the same job. Customer success, calls the customers to finish their application, you finish them for them and a person sitting behind you ( the loan operations team) receives the same application and if the customers are missing something, they do not call them, they ask you to call them again,.... hello credible? Can one person do everything at once? That way you save money in wages and stop burning cash capital! ? Unbelievable inefficient the whole operation.","Say hello to your employees, is called COMMON COURTESY AND CORDIALITY. Be smart about business operations and engage the customer success team with the rest of the teams so they do not feel rejected or at the bottom of the pool. Is horrendous the way you treat people. Also, hire people in the leadership team that have a vast understanding of the English language. Basic skills to perform the job lack at the customer success team.",1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

2) A Truly Helpful Product: It's a privilege getting to develop, market and operate a product that helps Americans arrive at the optimal financial outcome, often reducing their student loan debt so that they can achieve grater financial flexibility.
3) Culture of Teaching and Learning: Employees take time out of their day to educate others on the tools and processes relevant to their role. For younger employees, this means they can start to develop skills for future roles at Credible and at other companies.
4) Transparent and Data Driven: The whole company is aware of the key metrics we are trying to hit.
