I have been working here for 6 months, but feels like I have been a part of DJ family for long time. I like working at DJ. The culture of this company is great.

2017-01-18,,"Bronx, NY",Former Employee ,"Poor senior management, poor pay, poor benefits","Poor senior management, poor pay, poor benefits",0,"The senior management of the company used to be good (when I started) but the good managers left and the ones that remain do not appear to care about their employees.

They have hired junior testers with little to zero experience and then trained them. Giving new people a chance to break into the market. They also promoted some of these junior people to lead roles if they showed they were capable.","Senior managers make promises (many, many promises) regarding pay, bonuses, vacations, and benefits and they managed to fail to keep ANY of them.
The benefits were outrageously expensive. At my new company, I am paying one fifth of what I had to pay at Doran Jones and I have a much lower deductible.
The management team appears out of touch with how modern tech companies operate. They have a dress code for developers who are working off-site away from the DJ customers. They watch the clock for when employees arrive and leave and do not look at the overall work being completed. They are quick to criticize and slow to reward.
The company does not have a sales team and rarely brought in new clients.",,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
