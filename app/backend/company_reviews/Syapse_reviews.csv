2018-03-18, Senior Software Engineer,"Wayne, PA",Current Employee ,Genuinely excited to come to work every day.,Genuinely excited to come to work every day.,0,"Great team with highly skilled engineers. In the Wayne office, we've been extremely selective of who we've hired and most new hires are interviewed by a large subset of the employees in the office. This has nurtured a culture that has genuinely made me excited to come to work. Due to this we've had almost no attrition and become a more cohesive unit as we've grown,

Engineers have a significant amount of control over how things are built, which is great for self starters and those looking to actually understand the value behind features. With that said, it won't work well for someone who is just looking to close tickets and ""punch out"" at 5.

Flexible working hours with emphasis on personal responsibility. There are no set working hours and we can take vacation whenever needed, but don't leave your team hanging and make sure you're pushing the company forward. No pressure to not take vacation and no one is checking who is and isn't at their desks.

Precision medicine is an exciting field. There is obviously the ""we're curing cancer"" aspect, but the reality is that there is a lot of potential for a company like ours. On top of that the software/field is actually super interesting and makes it cool to not just be building another basic webapp or CMS.

The office is a pretty solid setup. Open working area with plenty of smaller rooms for heads down work. It's very casual and there is no dress code. Plenty of free food and some catered lunches.","We're in the midst of exiting our ""awkward teenage years"". Due to the considerable growth we've needed to pivot, change and hire quickly. This means restructuring of teams, moving into new offices (both Wayne and SF office are new locations in the past year), and restructuring application architecture. This has given rise to a bit of resentment (as seen in some of the other reviews), but also opens a lot of opportunity for those wishing to push forward into a better technical space.

Technical debt. Between changing customer strategy and some more rigid previous engineering leaders we've built up a decent amount of technical debt. Luckily we've made some changes in the past 6 months and better architecture is no longer a discussion topic but a reality. Unfortunately, some engineers are left maintaining some code that is a bit stale.

While wanting to grow the company, we've hired a bit more middle management than is necessary for the amount of engineers. This will eventually even itself our once more engineers are hired, but in the meantime a number of engineers are plagued by reporting to multiple different individuals.","The Executive team has a good vision for the company going forward. Unfortunately, I think at times there is a disconnect properly relaying that down to the employees.

Amazing customers . Top notch founder with a lot of energy and clarity of though when talking about the vision of the company. CEO is approachable.","The new management has hired a bunch of middle managers and a number of scrum / agile people who are making life miserable for the engineers. They are not always prepared for the meetings and are super unorganized. They keep getting confused between sprints and their policies . They keep changing the policies and ask the same question again and again. The PMO office should make an attempt to understand the structure of the code base and what the functionality the team is going to build in order to understand what keeps getting discussed in the million scrum meetings that happen in a week. Thats why we need technical people running the show so that its not such a pain for the engineers. 90% of the meetings are chaotic at its best if not useless. You walk out with no contribution or a worse outcome than when you entered the meeting.

Add to this the unpreparedness of the product. They keep shifting priorities every week , every day . It makes me wonder if they have any idea what they are building.

They are some very good managers especially internally promoted ones who have been in the company for a long time. They understand and interactions with them are not so bad. But the new employees are not spending enough time on ground to understand the company ,product , customers and the people before they go about announcing their moves and policies.

Also there is an increasing shift towards expectations around working in weekends and late nights just because some people are excited about doing that. Its more than obvious that such a work life imbalance is impossible and not sustainable for most people in the company and it does not help in the long run.

2018-03-08, Senior Software Engineer,"Wayne, PA",Current Employee ,An awesome place to work,An awesome place to work,0,"Before I get into the nitty-gritty review, two quick notes:

1. Some of these other reviews are disingenuous, in my opinion. If you look closely, several of the negative reviews were written by the same person, and I just can't agree with many of their points.

2. I work out of the Philly office, and so my experiences with the culture might be a bit different from those in San Francisco.

So, first thing's first -- let's talk about where Syapse is at as a company. I've been here for about three years and have experienced a fair amount of change.

Syapse is a startup that's growing like crazy. The organization changes rapidly as new people are brought on and that has brought with it some discomfort as priorities change and decisions are made. I can see how some would find this kind of change abrasive and annoying but, to be completely honest, this is why I joined a startup: there's an endless stream of opportunities to step up and lead. At Syapse, if you see something that you'd like to change, you just do it. Grab a few other people who have a similar vision, and prototype it. Bring it to the table and share it, and you're likely to get support from everyone else.

The company is also incredibly dedicated to the mission. I know a lot of companies are all talk and no substance, but that's not the case at Syapse at all. Patient care and safety is at the forefront of every discussion. We're all laser-focused on improving cancer treatments. Many of us have been personally affected by cancer, and it shows in our work. If you're actually looking to make a difference, Syapse is where you want to work.

Along with the mission and growth came blue-chip customers. We have an absolutely astounding customer base given the size of the company. We're expanding internationally. We have big-name strategic partners. It's mind-boggling to be how such a small company has such a strong market presence.

Working here has been one of the best career experiences in my life. My manager is fantastic and goes to bat for the team. Learning and career growth are top of mind for management. The people I work with are smart and dedicated. We don't hire B-team engineers (in Philly, at least).

The pay, perks, and benefits are excellent. Super flexible schedule, catered lunches every week, an infinite supply of snacks, drinks, and caffeine. Work-life balance is awesome.

Overall, I love working here. The growing pains -- while annoying at times -- make things exciting and full of opportunity.","As I said in the Pros, Syapse is going through some growing pains.

* There are a _ton_ of new people being brought in, and this is having an effect on the culture (especially in SF, from what I hear).
* They're trying really, really hard to implement Scrum for engineering, which is definitely rubbing people the wrong way.
* There is a crazy amount of management right now. The company is hiring lots of managers, but hiring on the engineering side is a bit slower. I think open head count is approximately appropriate, but one is growing much faster than the other.
* Our deadlines are aggressive, and some teams have micromanagers that slow progress.
* Meetings. Holy crap are there a lot of meetings sometimes.","* For the teams that have a micromanagement issue, you need (_need_) to address it. If you don't, you're going to discourage your engineers and turn a bunch of dedicated employees into nine-to-fivers looking for other jobs.
* Implement monthly compulsory skip-level one-on-ones until we get through this growth phase. Your higher-level managers need to get feedback from the individual contributors and address it quickly.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
2018-03-06,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Forward momentum with a positive mission,Forward momentum with a positive mission,0,"The most obvious positive aspect to working at Syapse is the company mission. Working on a product that has the ability to positively impact how cancer is treated in the US is really what drives me.

That being said, the technical challenges and ability to learn and embrace new solutions is also a major driver of satisfaction. Working with some truly talented engineers, ontologists and product managers pushes on our boundaries, forcing us to consider new options or technologies. That's both fun, and good for career development.","The company's seen some growing pains transitioning from a small start-up into a larger company.

2018-03-05,,"Wayne, PA",Current Employee ,Great company with a bright future,Great company with a bright future,0,"Syapse is the real deal. You can find lots of companies who claim they are trying to bring healthcare into the 21st century, but Syapse is actually doing the hard and necessary work to actually make precision cancer care a reality. This is an incredibly important mission and it's what continues to motivate me every day.

Syapse has great customers. Many companies would feel lucky to have just one of the US health systems Syapse has, let alone all of them. That doesn't even take into account international expansion to South Korea and partnerships with industry leaders like Medidata and Roche.

Syapse has great benefits. The leadership team has rolled out an entirely new benefits package in 2018 that substantially increases benefits for employees. The benefits rival those offered by much larger companies: transit benefits, gym memberships, affordable health insurance plans, 401K, snacks, a weekly catered lunch, etc...

Philly area office has great culture. The east coast office in Radnor/Wayne has a great, cohesive team. The company has significantly invested in this location with a new office space and added amenities.

Syapse is a company that learns from past mistakes. Companies are made up of humans and humans are imperfect and make mistakes. Over the last year, Syapse has transformed itself into a company that is relentlessly focused on improving itself and increasing customer value. In particular, there is an intensity around measuring this value, setting aggressive delivery goals and achieving them. There are some negative reviews here specifically about the management team. Syapse is a company with a serious mission. If you value concrete goals, being held to high standards, and expecting high standards from your colleagues, there is a lot you will find to like here.","Syapse is a company that is in the transition phase that many companies go through around 150 employees. As many new team members join, the old ways of doing things don't work anymore and need to change. These growing pains are real and can be difficult. I would suggest that some of the negativity you see in a few other reviews here are from individuals who are having difficulty adjusting to all the changes that are happening.

There can be a lot of meetings. As the company has grown and new processes have rolled out, the number of people who need to be in sync and coordinate has gone up, resulting in more meetings.",Continue with the cultural and organizational changes that are underway.

+ If you are a good talker and approach the job with the right political mentality you will be successful.
+ Low technical entry bar","- Lack of experience on engineering , made worse because there are huge egos that will stubbornly continue down wrong paths, despite warnings from the few experienced engineers. This happened so much that the experienced engineers have left. The engineers who built the core of Syapse and most public products are gone, and the engineers who took over don't know what they are doing because they dont have experience and they didn't write the code. Some experienced engineers moved to management and they no longer ever code and spend their days in meetings. Code review comments are routinely ignored. The other reviews mentioning lack of github/sql knowledge are true. Most don't actually know proper OO programming.
Tip: If you are interviewing here, make sure you really probe back at the projects that your intervewers are working on and make sure they can really describe the technical tradeoffs they made. Chances are they won't be able to.

- No accountability. This is improving, but its not possible to change the culture so drastically with just a couple of management hires. Software architect has spent the majority of time upgrading code-base to python 3 for the better part of a year (guess what, we still havent migrated and I bet we never will). Why is this OK? Every time a deadline is missed, there is always a million excuses immediately ready. Ask what happens when a production fire occurs? At Syapse, people will actively dodge and have an excuse why they cant help this time. The people who end up working the entire weekend or all night to try to debug the issue are always the same people, and this never includes the most ""senior"" people (the software architects, the staff engineers. the actual senior software engineers).
Tip: Ask your interviewer about the last few projects they worked on and whether they met the schedule. Ask them whether all ""senior"" employees help out on fires or bugs.

- Politics. Management has their favorites and it doesn't have anything to do with productivity. There have been so many instances of credit stealing and grandstanding, which has caused multiple senior engineers to leave. The people at Syapse who have been promoted the most are the ones who spend their entire day boasting about all the things that they do and all the subjects that they are experts in. Dig a little and you will see they are just middlemen who provide nothing but more processes and meetings, all carefully planned so that meetings with the people who do the work don't overlap with meetings with higher-ups so that they can exaggerate their performance and claim total credit.
Tip: Ask your interviewer about when they last received a promotion. Ask them if they know what everyone at the company does and whether everyone is contributing to the success of the company.

- Doesnt take care of employees. Another review has stated that no refreshers are granted for equity, which is true. There are also raises promised, that end up being delayed for months with no further mention of it unless the employee constantly prods, or just forgotten. The management of incentives is so off here that there is no real reason to do anything but the minimum. No one knows what their job title means and what responsibilities come with it: what is the difference between a software architect and a senior software engineer?

- Big company processes with small company expectations. Multiple hour scrum meetings every couple of weeks, many hours reporting to all the different people who ask you for status (middlemen who are aiming for credit). Too bad expectations and deadlines are always set to be delivered quickly.

Flexible schedule: Can work form home as needed","No accountability across any organization: Promises are made and every couple of months, there is a new all hands meeting where we talk about how things are going to change. Nothing changes.

Endless excuses for why we don't deliver on promises: You will run into an endless wall of excuses if you ever depend on another team or team member to deliver.

Dead weight all over: For a company this small, there is a lot of management and middlemen. Software architects spend their time refactoring code and renaming variables and all the big decisions are left up to junior engineers.

Major office politics for a company this size

Undervalued engineering: You will always hear ""just do this"" or ""just do that"" for major assignments. Many here think that engineering is easy and doing every shortcut we can think of is the best way to create a sustainable system. Major technical debt all over that only a very small handful of people understand.

Below average salaries and no stock options after your first signing: No additional equity is ever given and after dilution each round; quality people have no reason to stick around beyond their first year.

Constant fire drills: There is always some new event that forces the same set of people to have to pull all nighters or work through the weekend. The work life balance is good, except for probably 15% of the company that is forced to always work on the latest fire drill.",Understand who brings value and in what way and develop a culture of responsibility instead of a culture of excuses.,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0
