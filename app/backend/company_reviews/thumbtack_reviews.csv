If you do not have a passion for helping others, or you do not see yourself in a position to accept and openly offer criticism, you will not grow here. If you work hard and actively propel yourself you will love working at Thumbtack.","Some of Thumbtack's values, while for the most part are positive can have a tendency to run faster than what they can keep up with. They are constantly trying to change to improve and it's invaluable in the technology industry but can be frustrating if ideals have been implemented, yet they are already working on the next before they've mastered the recent.","It's okay to slow down a little. #Go shouldn't just mean run, run, run.

The actual job itself is pretty standard to a call center job, however, it doesn't feel that way because of how many fun things are going on at Thumbtack. There is a very open feel, as there are no cubicles, couches to sit on, weekly meetings with leadership, that makes you feel like you are included in the process. You get catered lunches Mon-Fri which save a ton of money especially since they are great caterers that make the food fresh every day, kombucha on tap, and tons of snacks to munch on. There is a gym to use, and tons of events to break up the monotony of the work week. Culture is everything here! Oh and you get ""Thumbtack bucks"" to use quarterly which can save you a lot of money on your personal projects you'd use the site for on your own.","Constant changes with teams and the product itself, this can be good or bad depending on how you like a changing environment. For me I don't mind but I know some people have a hard time with it. There is not as much room for growth as I would like, it seems a lot of people when they get to where I am at have left for other companies after applying for multiple positions here and not getting them. There has been talk of getting a bonus structure built out for quite a while, but nothing put in place yet and it's been over a year. Honestly, I love the culture but other jobs do seem tempting that have a more competitive compensation for similar roles.","Don't mention a bonus structure until it is ready to actually be put into place. It leads to disappointment when one isn't built out when you thought it was going to be. I love the culture though and keep up the good work with making things so fun at work!

Well someone at Thumbtack thought it was cool and turned that into a policy. Now it becomes the norm to have to message the coworker sitting right next to you to ask a question, because they wear their headphones on.
- At some point, someone pointed out that employees should clean after themselves and not leave their mugs behind.

No leadership member is held accountable for this attrition.

- Promotions are incredibly rare, and people can excel at their jobs for 2+ years without any tangible career progression.

There's a lot of energy behind that vision.","In the Salt Lake office, the culture was once laid-back, fun, and amazing. At the time I started working there, it was hands-down the best place to work in Utah. People were promoted based on hard work and drive. Employees constantly went above and beyond because at that time, you were recognized for doing so.

Now, however, the Salt Lake office has become riddled with political agendas and favoritism. Managers that were once friendly with their employees became bosses, pushing numbers instead of empowering people. People get promoted based on their friendships outside of work with their managers, rather than their actual achievements. (For example: The people who go out drinking with the boss are the ones that get the most attention, rather than the ones that keep their heads down.) You can have the exact same metrics as someone else, but they'll get promoted over you because they're sucking up and you're not. This never, EVER used to be allowed at Thumbtack (most managers would be annoyed with the teacher's pet kind of employee), but now it's the norm.

Many departments are weighed down by stressful goals and ridiculous, impossible performance plans that only set people up to fail. There are multiple managers in multiple departments that aren't people leaders and don't know how to be. Those managers in particular are a HUGE part of what has destroyed the culture and have pushed people to their limit.

Surprisingly for a company that's growing rapidly, there's little to no opportunity for growth in many departments there. The only hope you have for moving up is starting in customer support. However, once you're out of that department, good luck going anywhere else.

The Salt Lake office is also riddled with HR red flags, but it's virtually impossible to go to HR without getting in trouble for it. Multiple managers and ""star"" employees are walking HR violations, but continue to be rewarded rather than punished for their behavior.

Overall, Thumbtack WAS an amazing place to work but now the culture is stressful, toxic, and severely overrated.",Management needs to go back to treating people like people rather than numbers. The culture has wilted and died because of managers who don't stand up for the best interest of their employees and ultimately let them fail.,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

The culture here is excellent, it really feels like family when coming here, which is a good thing since we spend most of our days with our co-workers. Cross department communication is great as well.

-Room for Growth

Internal mobility is encouraged here, as well as opportunities to be a mentor or mentee with another Thumbtacker.

-Seamless Onboarding

This really gets started about a week before you get here, you get to pick your own equipment and desk setup before you even get here. When you do get here all of your stuff is ready to go at your desk, including a sweet little welcome package. Extended onboarding includes Thumbtack University which is a multi-day training session that goes over the company and its history. The product’s evolution and current state, and some research methods and options within Thumbtack.

-Food

The food here is ridiculously good. Food here is cooked in house by some of the most amazing chefs. You’ll be enjoying daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner (except Fridays). Also with Thursday snack days you’ll be treated to an assortment of in house snacks and beverages. Speaking of beverages there are ‘coolers’ or ‘refreshers’ made in house, a personal favorite is the Passion Fruit cooler. We also have a few beers and wines on tap, and in cans/bottles if you don’t like those options. There’s even an instagram account dedicated to this talented crews’ work.

-Extremely flexible with PTO

Need time off? Take it.

-Transparency

Meeting notes are dispersed across departments which provides a window on what the company is working on. This goes all the way to the top.

-Thoughtful and Hands on Leadership

Leadership here is astoundingly great and active! They’re quick to respond to major events and set a great atmosphere for the company as a whole. They listen to feedback

-Offsite Team Building Events

Want to get to know your team better? Don’t worry you’ll have a lot of opportunities to get out of the office with your team and build that relationship up!

-On-site Guest Speaker Events

Thumbtack is increasing their efforts in being thought leaders and having more community based events.

-Community Involvement

Thumbtackers respond to help out our local community, especially when they need it most like our most recent fires. We also have a few internal groups for different sports and activities that take place outside of work hours.

-SF Office Space / Location

We’re in the Twitter building which is pretty convenient for most people living in the city, and pretty close to most transportation options.",It's hard to write something here without sounding pretentious and entitled.

I've read other reviews about Thumbtack too especially the negative ones and they're all on point. They say that they're not micromanaging you but the truth is they are. They use positive-scripting to ""keep the culture"" but they're not really doing a great job.
- when it comes to promotion, it's also who you know and not what you know.
- people that are personally struggling don't get much support from the management and the company although that WAS their intention. It used to be an employee-centered company too, but now they're just about numbers and how to make the company bigger.
- I used to brag about Thumbtack but now I would not even recommend it to anyone anymore because of all the changes
- not much career growth.

I've learned as much about software engineering as I have about product decision-making, analytics, and project management—all as a new-grad hire.

Almost everyone here is exceptionally helpful and cooperative. The company is intensely mission-driven and people are well-aligned with the company's vision.

People here are smart. With few exceptions, I am impressed by the caliber of team members here and the lengths they go to not only understand our customers, product, and market.

There is immense company growth potential. We are years ahead of even our biggest competitors in a market that, in the US alone, is worth $700 billion annually. There are few other tech companies that can even claim to have that much potential for growth—let alone a strong chance at realizing that potential.

Upper management is excellent. I rarely question the decisions made by executives about our team and our product because they are accessible, transparent about their reasoning, and deeply concerned with data-driven decision-making. At the same time, they seem to balance these traits with well-honed intuitions about how to make step changes in the product that take us in the right direction.","While the company has been receptive to feedback about career growth, it still has room for improvement. I realize catering to people's career growth needs is often in tension with team agility and bureaucracy minimization, but I think Thumbtack is capable of finding a better balance.

Given our ambitions, we need to grow our team more quickly than we currently are, without resorting to the pell-mell of hiring that was 2016. I think a crucial part of this will be polishing our brand and doing better at publicizing the great work we're doing here.","Trust your team members to take initiative, give them space to own their work, and be a source of context and assistance.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

Decent working hours.
Specific teams aren't bad.
The benefits are great.","Faking it completely. The CEO came to Salt Lake to deliver news and decided to plant people in the audience to say kind things about the updates to shape the narrative. If that isn't shady, I don't know what is.
The politicking is insane.
The ""culture"" isn't diverse. Hiring the same type of people doesn't get you new ideas or thinking outside of the box. Getting actually diversity in people instead of who they voted for would do you good. It's a fancy call center for lazy hipsters.
The CEO and leadership think they are bigger than they are and walk around with their noses in the air. They company is still growing and it's a good time to be humble.
There wasn't an HR until the last year or so. Lots of issues brewing that aren't being solved. People get promoted to leadership because of who they know, not because of their work ethic. Overpaid management and underpaid staff.
Management who used to be in HR actually sexually harassed employees without any repercussions even with ALL of senior leadership knowing about it.
Firing managers, senior leaderships, and VPs is seen as a weakness so they will keep people around who are clearly unqualified just to save face.
Being a ""cool place to work"" invites inappropriate behavior that is brushed off as being ""fun"" or ""hip"" yet they push unbias training down everyones throat and make it mandatory that you show up. It's not helpful and all it does is push people who were already afraid of speaking up further into their corners.","Take actual advice. Stop preaching ""always be improving"" when no one in sr. leadership in the TSL office has shown any sign of it. It's covered up with daily high fives that disrupt your work.

The product Thumbtack is working on will change the services market, if they don't continue on this horrible path they are on.","Micromanagers, bosses instead of leaders, metrics that are hard to obtain, constantly being told you're paid more than you're worth, constant changes that don't make any sense.

The changes that are made on a weekly basis just anger professionals we work with and they feel like Thumbtack is just in it for the money, which is it seeming like it more and more everyday. When you bring up feedback, you think they care about it, but they don't do much to implement it. We have 2 offices, and the office in SF is not in tune with SLC, so they make changes that WE know are going to anger customers, and they are surprised when they get negative feedback.

TT used to brag about transparency and how much they valued their employees, now they only care about numbers and you can end up getting fired in a matter of weeks because of their high metrics.

Lots of politics, if you're a brown noser, you will get special projects to work on and not have to work as hard as everyone else.

You are only important to Thumbtack as long as you are performing, if you have a tough week, you will get into a bad groove and it's hard to recover.

Some ""leaders"" take it upon themselves to target employees and try to get them fired for bringing up issues to upper management or hr.

2017-01-08,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best company I have ever worked for,,0,"The culture is fantastic. There are no egos, and pretty much everyone is willing to drop what they're doing to answer a question or to point you in the right direction. The company is built on transparency, so you know what other teams are working on and how that contributes to the larger vision of the exec team.

Everyone has an opportunity to make an impact. We're at that stage in which the user base is relatively well established, and yet is still growing rapidly. You won't be working on some widget that only a handful of people will see or use.

People come here because they believe in the product and the mission, not just to collect a paycheck.

In-house culinary team provides great food 3x a day. It is wonderful not to have to wander around SOMA every day looking for lunch.

Work-life balance is great. There is no pressure to work a minimum number of hours a day, and you have the flexibility to work from home if you have an obligation that prevents you from coming into the office. I've almost never done work after leaving the office for the day.

We're beyond the instability and uncertainty that comes with early startups, yet we've only captured a small fraction of the $700 billion local services marketplace. There's enormous room for growth and I'm confident we are moving in the right direction.","The company is growing so rapidly that sometimes there are breakdowns in communication, or teams step on each other's toes.

Understaffed in certain areas. Until recently, the mobile team was understaffed, and people with substantial front end experience are still in short supply. That's one of the major pain points in the overall dev cycle.

Greater proportion of people here (anecdotally), as compared to other companies in the Bay Area I've worked at, are married and/or have kids. So, don't expect a lot of interest if you ask people to go out for a drink or do something outside of work as they're probably making a beeline for the Caltrain station.","Continue to be selective about whom to hire, not only in terms of overall competence, but also in terms how well they ""fit"" into the Thumbtack culture.

This is a very creative and open work environment, with tons of hard problems and smart/fun people to work on them with. The company is in a huge growth cycle right now and so there is plenty of opportunities to make a huge impact very quickly. I've surprised myself by how much I have accomplished since coming here because of the responsibilities I've been given, and this is without anyone pushing long unnecessary hours on us!

Most importantly to me, above anything I mentioned above, is knowing that I'm building a product that is helping people carve out careers for themselves by their rules. We constantly get to hear stories from people that have created meaningful employment for themselves and others through Thumbtack and it really makes me feel like I'm doing something that matters.

2) The people at Thumbtack are great.

While we're doing well financially, there's no guarantee that Thumbtack will be around in 10 years. Having said that, this is also an opportunity. Everyone can make an impact at Thumbtack and leave their mark here in a way that wouldn't be possible at one of the aforementioned companies.","Be as aggressive as possible in getting us to where we all want to be.

- Extremely cautious, planning oriented culture. Good and bad. Helps work/life balance, feels mature and improves execution. But we could make bigger, more creative bets if we found ways to make occasional failure OK.
- Career development needs work. Titles here feel junior (vs. other companies) and can make people feel like Thumbtack doesn't believe in them (even when it does). Need to give people more chances to build new skills, not just execute their one function.

2014-12-23,,,Current Employee ,"Great place to work full of mission-driven, intellectual people",More than a year,0,"Thumbtack is a really great company with a very strong culture and an obsessive focus on improving itself. Everyone from the engineers to the recruiters to the operations teams are approachable, curious, humble, dedicated to learning, and fun to talk with. The product makes a difference in people's lives and the opportunity is huge, which makes the environment exciting and the work satisfying. Decisions from hires to product changes to ad buys are made in a very thoughtful, rigorous manner, but bad decisions are owned up to and abandoned quickly.

Very little ego or politics within the company, as everyone seems committed to making the best decisions to help the team, and working hard to make that decision making process as analytically rigorous and free from bias as possible. As a start up there are many opportunities for team members to contribute and expand their horizons and leadership offers support for people to figure out and implement new things.

I love coming to work here.","The relentlessly thoughtful decision making process means that the company can move more slowly than it perhaps should at times. Engineer hiring has proven to be a major bottleneck due to absurdly high standards for new hires. As a result, teams that could get by with less than world-class engineers are left without any engineering resources at all. Also as a result the product has simple, glaring flaws that go left unaddressed, and there are clearly areas of the company set up years ago that have been given no thought in a while as attention is focused elsewhere. Huge opportunity for new hires to fix these things and help this company realize its potential.",The company is incredibly transparent but somehow key decisions aren't getting communicated across teams. Resources that are largely locked within certain areas today could be made more available to others. Consider hiring more experienced staff across the board so there is a diminished need for everyone to be learning on the job at the same time. More experienced staff could also provide leadership and guidance that is somewhat lacking today.,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0
2016-05-16, Product Analyst,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Amazing people,,0,"*** TEAM ***
The people and the culture they embody make Thumbtack a truly special place to work. These adjectives describe the team:
+ Hyper intelligent
+ Friendly
+ Positive & optimistic
+ Ambitious
+ Open minded
+ Collaborative
+ Trustworthy
+ Emotionally intelligent

A lot of qualities emerge from this mix. I'm a person who tends to attract conflict. I'm loud, outspoken, and I don't react well to foul play. I can truly say that in 1 year of working here I have yet to had a single conflict with anyone here, work related or otherwise. I also haven't met one person who I really don't want to work with. For me, both of those facts really stand out.

*** VISION ***
Thumbtack has been around for quite sometime, 7 or 8 years. Throughout that time, the founders' vision has remained remarkably consistent. They also communicate it effectively. That solves a lot of problems for a growing team. We may disagree on execution, but we all share the same long term vision for the company and the product. That, combined with the attributes mentioned above, make me really feel like I'm part of a team all striving together towards the same shared goal.

*** SOCIAL GOOD ***
It's really hard for most of us to be excited about working for companies of neutral or dubious societal value. My last job was in social / F2P games so believe me, I know what I'm talking about. Working on a platform that empowers small businesses to succeed and helps customers have confidence in hiring professionals is really easy to be excited about. Every week we are treated to more stories about professionals whose lives have been changed by the ability Thumbtack gives them to pursue and succeed at their dreams.","- The salary and benefits are very average. Certainly not bad, but also not a selling point.
- Thumbtack expects a lot out of its employees. The high bar in hiring corresponds to an equally high bar in performance. This can create a climate where people feel taken for granted. If you're not shipping product that moves a key metric by 20%, you're generally not receiving much praise. Not a good place to feel insecure. If you're doing well, meeting expectations, you probably won't hear very many thank you's or good job's.","Recognition doesn't mean getting your name on the screen at our weekly ""All-thumbs"" meeting. It doesn't mean winning an award. It doesn't mean getting a #LoveIt from a co-worker. Recognition means a culture of gratitude. When I finish a project it's great to hear all of the ideas for how I could take it to the next level. But if I've produced acceptable work, don't forget the ""Thank you,"" and ""Good woork!""

They are really stand-up guys who are concerned more about the good they do and how they affect people's lives than their bottom line.","Very heavy politics which bleed into upper management in TSL. One or two weak managers promote and keep weaker players in leadership positions because they are liked and not because of their contributions or proven skills. They tout transparency but fail to examine the facts behind complaints about management and look for anywhere (or anyone) else to point the finger to rather than holding the leaders accountable first - which could end up being a much larger downfall and problem as Thumbtack scales.

Weak and inexperienced managers are allowed to continue making the same mistakes at the cost of their direct reports productivity, career progression/security, reputation and morale and are not held accountable to any level of responsibility for their own actions or inactions.","VP or Directors doing team skip-levels will help them stay directly in touch with what agents are thinking/feeling about management and other practices at the front lines and help eliminate politics as information is passed up the chain.

I won’t go into details on those aspects as they are mostly covered by other reviews. What really makes me excited to come to work each day is what Thumbtack differentiates from other startups.

Thumbtack is competing in a huge market (800 billions per year in US for local services)/ Like in any other big markets: search, social network or online shopping, there will eventually have one dominate player at the end. (Google for search, Facebook for social network, Amazon for online shopping). Based on the current competition status, Thumbtack has a good shot to win this game.

Tech startups live or die on growth, no doubt about that. Thumbtack focuses on making a profitable business as much as pushing impressive growth rate. We don't play games of selling 1 dollar for 70 cents to feed the growth like many other startups. The business model of Thumbtack is creative, healthy and having a great potential.",I feel we are not moving fast enough on the product and engineering side.

- The food is amazing. We're so spoiled with talented in-house chefs who keep us well fed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- We're doing very human-centric work that positively impacts so many lives—it's very cool to see.
- We're on verge of getting very big, very quickly.","But thing's aren't perfect.
- A lot of very similarly minded people—a little diversity of thought would do us good.
- Our high focus on data and conversion changes is good but comes with the danger of thwarting creativity, big-picture thinking, and risk taking.
- All those smart people who work here mean a lot of employees are doing work they're overqualified for with unclear paths for internal growth.
- Growing pains. We're still learning how to adapt our structure and process to accommodate a much larger office. There's a lot of hustle and far less attention to culture.","- Don't forget to focus on culture. Hard work is an important value to nurture, but so is encouragement and affirmation.

- Seek out leaders, not just high-performers. A structure that encourages natural mentorship and growth is a good thing.

-In it for the long haul to build a sustainable business, and I think we have a very good shot at succeeding","I have basically one con. We're rather image focused. This takes several forms:
-We are recruiting heavily, which means we want to appear like a good place to work. We send out multiple reminders to fill out Glassdoor reviews, write and upvote recruiting blog posts, and so on. Now, we actually happen to *be* a decent place to work. But it's a little weird to be in a place where a large part of your job is proselytizing rather than doing the things you are proselytizing about...
-Our business was built around SEO. Fortunately optimizing for SEO tends to somewhat aligned with creating value for the world. But when considering a feature, we sometimes ask ""what will get Googlebot to like us more"" rather than ""what will make a better product for our users.""","As the company grows, put more effort into ethical behavior -- in our past, we could be decent people without much conscious effort.

2015-03-27, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best company I've ever worked for,Less than a year,0,"Thumbtack is amazing. The culture is extremely open and trusting. Everyone has a manager, but they are very non-interfering. Thumbtack hires extremely intelligent individuals who are capable of getting whatever tasks assigned to them done. Therefore, managers aren't micro-managing and are really there to ensure your development as a person.

Everything that goes on is super transparent. Every meeting that occurs has meeting minutes that are emailed out to the entire company. Any email list or slack channel is open for anyone to join. We work in an open-floor plan, meaning that I sit two desks over from the CEO. Everyone from the CEO, to the VP of engineering, to the person you sit next to is very approachable and extremely willing to hear your thoughts about anything.

I love all of my coworkers. I would seriously be very happy to hang out with every single one of them outside of work. They are all super friendly, super smart, and super humble. They all want you to succeed on anything you are working on because we are all one team, with one mission, trying to make service professional interactions better. They are all very willing to give up their time to make sure your projects succeed.

Lastly, but not least importantly, the Thumbtack product is amazing. There was a survey done of our service professionals, asking where they would be without Thumbtack. One of the most common responses we received was ""hungry."" These professionals literally would not be able to find customers without Thumbtack and would not be able to afford food. I love waking up everyday and coming to work because I know I am making people's lives drastically easier and better.","The only negative I can think of is that we're now getting to a size where I don't know everyone's name.

Thumbtack is tackling a pretty massive problem and growth has been really great to see- $130M in funding since I've joined, the team size has doubled, we've set up a new office in Salt Lake City, and we've hired a handful of really sharp senior hires to learn from.",The company is still young and leaders are still learning as we grow.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Thumbtack has been a breath of fresh air in a sea of ridiculousness. Of course there are the perks that every other company here offers - home cooked meals, fancy gadgets, beautiful office, lots of fun events, but it's really the kindness and support that makes Thumbtack stand out.

It's the handwritten letter from the founders on your work anniversary. It's the encouragement to really explore what you want out of your career. It's the complete transparency around tricky situations. It's the trust given to you because you know that if Thumbtack hires you, you're opinion and expertise is respected.

It doesn't hurt that the benefits are good too - unlimited vacation (no - for real, you're encouraged to take it), good pay, work from home days and an amazing $1500 education stipend. Working here makes me feel like I'm not only investing my time in Thumbtack, but investing in my career long-term, wherever that takes me.","The one similarity Thumbtack has to many start-ups is the crazy fast growth that sometimes means important decisions and processes are long over-due. Sometimes you'll hard on a project that then gets changed last minute. Or that they're so busy hiring leadership that you end up floating and without a ton of direction for stretches of time. The opportunities for career growth here at Thumbtack are unclear. I think management is open to progression (promotions/raises) in theory, but I've never seen it in practice. A lack of cost-of-living raises is also a bit of a downer.","Don't stress so much about making Thumbtack a fun place to work. Trust that Thumbtack itself can be enough. Office parties and boat trips and Onesie Wednesday are all great, but many of us would much rather have raises any day.

At the time of writing there are about 80 employees in the San Francisco office, so you'll often find yourself quickly becoming the authority on a subject since no one else has done your work before. It can be stressful at times if you find yourself in over your head. There are two sides to this issue, however, since you will learn a lot by being in this position.","Overall the management is very strong. If you are interested, all of the meeting notes for every team in the company are published, so you can easily learn about what other teams and even what management itself is working towards.

We do things with intention and it ties up into the bigger picture. Also with the growth, by default I've been able to own a substantial chunk of the business.

You can see the outcome of this process in the current team - I seriously feel like I learn so much from my colleagues - both on a professional and personal level - every day. I feel so lucky and blessed to be here.
- The opportunity is incredible for two reasons: 1. the enormous size of what we're going after is insane - we're trying to improve the way the entire professional services economy is run globally!! - and 2. we're helping real people in the real world. Literally every day we have service professionals write in to us and thank us for building Thumbtack - ""I was down on my luck and out of work, then I found Thumbtack. Thumbtack has transformed my life. I'm now able to put food on the table for my family again, feel proud of myself again, I just bought a new pickup truck and am finally able to invest in myself...""

Thumbtack is a place where every voice has value. No one's input is above or beneath anyone else's. As a mid-level manager, I am empowered to make the decisions I need for my team. When I request resources I am extremely well supported, and I feel my team makes valued contributions toward long-range company goals. The transparency, while at times overwhelming, is incredibly refreshing compared to other industries I've worked in.","The culture of transparency contributes to information overload, which means internal communication isn't nearly as effective as it could be. I believe this will be resolved eventually but it's definitely a pain point today. Also, my compensation is lower than I would like, but I get incredible work-life balance and very interesting work to off-set that. So my salary is okay for today, but will likely be a problem for me a year from now.","Our transparency is a great thing. It hurts us when the flow of information becomes a flood, and then a tsunami. Other reviewers have pointed out key decisions aren't communicated across teams. I don't think the problem is these decisions aren't communicated. I think that information is lost in the sea of updates we swim through daily. We should prioritize for this year establishing some internal communication methods to help people filter data quickly and key in on what's relevant to their team. You may need to hire someone with internal communications experience for this.

We are undergoing some growing pains; this is inherent to any company in our position in the marketplace and it's a good problem to have. But it does mean that processes and systems that got us by and were working even 3 months ago are hurting us today. Some people who've been with the company longer than I have (less than 1 year) are having trouble shifting from the mindset of fixing a problem today towards a mindset of fixing things that aren't problems yet, but will be. The first approach gets us through the next quarter, the latter sets us up for long-term success. Some training and coaching on change management for everyone in a leadership role would help.
