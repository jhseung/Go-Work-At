• Pay is competitive/comfortable for Austin.","• Too many clueless people in positions of power, who don't always put the company's best interests in place of their own.

• Lack of transparency i.e. when colleagues were promoted, there was sensitivity on making it public. Perhaps if we had actual goals that we were accountable for, and there were less politics, then maybe announcing promotions wouldn't be perceived as arbitrary.

2017-10-21,,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,So Far So Great,,0,"I'm a relatively new employee, but I'll say that the onboarding was hands down the best that I've ever experienced when it comes to setting you up for contributing to the company quickly and effectively (without having to simply pretend that you know what you're doing). There are some great tools like ALEX that Spredfast has invested in to give new hires a great onboarding experience.

Talent-wise, there are a lot of really impressive folks working here from what I've seen. But that should be expected of a company of Spredfast's size where you can still reasonably scrutinize every hire. What I've really been impressed with is middle management's approach to coaching and development. Throughout my career, I've experienced a lot of management styles and found that it's incredibly rare to work under management, like what I've seen at Spredfast, that sees each individual for his/her own strengths/personality and tries to create a relationship that will help each individual be the best that he/she can be given those strengths. Many managers I've had will talk this talk but won't walk the walk. Of course, I don't report to every middle-manager at Spredfast so this statement only reflects my narrow experience.

Internal information is organized and structured phenomenally well. We have great systems in place that make it very easy (relatively speaking) to find information on product, industry knowledge, competitive, etc. And it seems like there is a great culture of encouraging everyone to contribute to the internal knowledgebase. In the several SaaS companies I've worked for, I've never seen a better use of SFDC for CRM and Salesforce Automation. And I've definitely never seen a better use of cloud documentation via Google Docs/Sheets/Slides, etc.","Generally speaking, it seems like a friction exists between teams and departments that I've been exposed to. There is a certain element of tribalism within teams, which can create strong bonds and loyalty within the team, but can also make it more challenging to work with tangent teams. To put this in perspective though, I would say that the interdepartmental friction is generally on par with other places I've worked at in the past. Perhaps slightly higher.","You've certainly done a lot of things right to put Spredfast where it is today in terms of culture and marketplace position. Perhaps take a page out of Michelle Obama's book and try to increase empathy between teams (easier said than done, of course). I feel like we're in a great situation overall, and what might take us to the next level is to somehow enhance trust and empathy between teams.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,

• Maternity leave, some paternity leave (albeit not as long as mat leave)","• When strategies shift, and they do so a couple times a year, people are left behind in the wake. Re-orgs, account management model changes, sales team focus - they all result in shifting goal posts. With little professional development outside of sales other departments are left scrambling to adjust to changes with little guidance.
• The company doesn't have a culture of development. Goals are loosely enforced (if you get any at all). There is no uniform review structure and no internal training (outside of sales). They can't settle on internal development tools so each team is at the whim of their VP or managers when it comes to development focus.
• There is little racial/ethnic diversity, but this may be an Austin problem. There is also a skew towards youth, which only becomes problematic when you don't have structures to help young people develop skills.
• The open office plan can be terrible, depending on who you end up sitting next to. There are a lot of people in the Austin HQ and they just keep jamming them in and moving them around.","Lean in and listen to your teams; they are smart and hard working.

We still get really healthy food options catered everyday, coffee, snacks, and more. It is not about what they give us but the fact that they care enough to prioritize those things is important to me. I love our downtown office location, and I love that I work with extremely intelligent and creative people who are trying to make an impact with the software we provide.","The hardest part about being at Spredfast is probably where we are at as a company. To me, I feel like its an opportunity to continue to push in order to see where we end up. However, there are product challenges, teams are constantly shifting and changing, and our company size makes it hard to be as nimble as we used to be.

I take a lot of pride in working with companies of this caliber (and when I forget, my non-SF friends remind me).
* Great colleagues - I've worked with A LOT of teams in my career, including in SaaS, including in startups, including in Austin, and I can say with confidence that this is a team that is both smart and has heart. Given the stage of growth we're going through, we need both of those things. And, I'm amazed at how many times people go out of their way to give others credit for their contributions (i.e., not just through YouEarnedIt).
* Intellectual challenge and career growth - with how social is changing its role in business, and with how we are moving from early/mid-stage and small to late stage and mid-sized, there is a constant puzzle to be solved. I can't think of any time I've been bored or felt that I wasn't trusted to think bigger than what's right in front of me. More importantly, I know that, wherever I land in my career, this will be an extremely valued experience (and in a career centered on fickle tech, this is key).
* Solid product strategy - in this crazy space, you have to have the strategy pinned down and keep the tactics flexible. I think the company landed on a strong target and offer earlier this year and now is marching ahead to execute.","* Benefits - I rated comp/benefits strongly, but I've been startup-centric for the past 5 years. And I hear persistent asks from team members on the 401K match. If we want to recruit more widely, from a diversity of careers and locations, we will have to deal with this gap.
* ""Globalization"" - Really, a need to broaden out our reach in customers and people outside the US and Austin, respectively. We are aiming high, and need to get even more serious about our ability to fan out and deliver to big, global companies. I also think that having a truly connected team outside of Austin keeps we Austinites better grounded (Austin is kept weird, and not always in a good way for business).
* Product execution/tension - related to above, we have to keep doing the ""less shiny"" kind of innovation to keep bringing in the ""more fancy"" types of customers. I think the company has taken great strides in driving scale, security, and administrative function in the platform - but there's always so much more to be done here, and it competes with social bells and whistles on a daily basis .","Keep on with the focus and strategy you laid out, while taking to heart where we have specific talent and product gaps to fill.

Also invest in your employees (401k) and give employees that have delivered a chance to contribute in a larger roll while kindly excusing the employees that are not performing.

Having been at Spredfast for a year now, I can firmly say this is the best company I have worked for. Of course, no company is perfect, but there is a LOT that I appreciate about this company:

1. There are some really smart people here, at ALL levels of the organization. This is true from the executive level down to the most entry level position.
2. I love that there are so many really smart women at every level in the organization. I say this as a male.
3. The folks in leadership positions truly value initiative, and are eager to clear a path for you to blaze your own trail within the company. If being given a list of directives and following orders are what works for you, this may not be the best place for you to work. If being given a goal, and then having the freedom to explore your path to achieving that goal is more your speed, you'll love it here.
4. We get to work on some really fun projects!

Overall, the benefits are pretty darn good. Lunch catered from Whole Foods 4 days a week is great. The 401k and health insurance isn't the best.","Some of these things may sound nit-picky, and others are likely department specific and may not apply across the entire company.

1. Social media is an evolving industry, and as the social networks constantly add/change features, Spredfast ends up having to pivot and make changes pretty often. Of course, this is rife with opportunity, while also being frustrating. To thrive here, you have to be comfortable with very frequent changes of direction.
2. Spredfast works with some really well known brands that are at the top of their respective industries. Because it is often hard for companies to truly measure the impact of the social marketing spending, our customers can be very demanding, and it is not uncommon to face high pressure situations with customers. Once again, situations like these can be opportunities or pitfalls depending on your outlook and disposition.
3. It can get fairly noisy in the office. While some of that is just a part of the culture of most young technology companies, there are more than a few people who don't have a good grasp of using their ""inside voices"" in the office. It is not uncommon for me to put headphones in my ear without any music playing just to cut out excess noise.
4. This is more of a personal gripe, but as someone who values punctuality, it bugs me that meetings at Spredfast almost always start and end late. It seems to just be an accepted thing.","Invest more in the technology! I know that growing our sales is a very important goal and pays the bills, but at the end of the day, the product is what delivers value.

You'll often hear those who do this called ""rock stars, "" and the culture is built around them. I've had numerous opportunities to explore different roles and have seen many others do the same with strong support from the business. I have truly loved working here and you should strongly consider Spredfast for your career.

Critical thinking is rewarded. Ideas, backed with data, can change the course of any decision and it doesn't matter who offers the idea. Speaking up is a must if you are to be heard here, but the good news is people listen.

The plentiful food, generous vacation policy, health benefits, excellent work/life balance, and trendy Austin office match most tech company benefits in Austin. Spredfast has HSA matching.","Always on the move, Spredfasts will pivot often. We not only have to replicate most features within every social network but innovate on top that. We're often tied to the whims of the networks. Facebook adds a new feature a customer wants to use, we have to add it, or they go outside the platform.

Pressures from established competitors, shiny point solutions, and demanding customers strain resources and clouds long-term visions by the very near-term threats.

The people can get pretty down if pipeline seems off or the extremely high goals set are not met. And in the back of everyone's minds, the main competitor lurks.

No 401K match and the plan options are so-so. Healthcare benefits are middle of the road for those with the HSA (still worth it if you are healthy). The conference room technology is inconsistent and often goes down (they are working on it).","Stop being competitor obsessed and invest in the product. I hear the main competitors name more than I do our own some days. Ultimately, ""It's the product, stupid.""

It was something I envisioned and hoped for when I started, and in that sense working here has exceeded my expectations.

When people ask me what I like best about Spredfast, my first answer is always ""the people"". Across the company, I've had the pleasure of working with some of the most talented, thoughtful, and kind individuals that I've encountered in my career. Not sure if this is an Austin thing, or just unique to the way we've grown as a company (lots of employee referrals), but I count myself fortunate to consider many of my colleagues good friends outside of work.

The social marketing space and the level of innovation is another ""pro"" in my book. If you enjoy being challenged, constantly learning new things, and being at the cutting edge of where social media is headed, then Spredfast will be a great place for you. You'll feel like an insider any time you read about something new that Facebook, Twitter, or any of the other social networks are doing.

Besides these two things, all of the other perks benefits that often get referenced in reviews make the day-to-day quite nice - downtown offices overlooking the lake, lunch from Whole Foods four days per week (and lots of nearby eating options - this is not life in an office park), a flexible vacation policy, a good work-life balance (note: probably varies by department, but I have always felt empowered to create a good balance between working hard and focusing on my personal life), and a good reputation in the Austin tech scene all combine to make Spredfast a great place to grow your career.","If you're the kind of person who doesn't like constant change, then Spredfast probably isn't the place for you. It's a fast-growing company in what is probably the one of the fastest changing markets, so there are definitely going to be times when you feel stretched and outside of your comfort zone. If you value being challenged, then this will be a pro, but otherwise I've seen people struggle with the ambiguity.","While I personally think change is great, change for change sake is not always the best course of action. If there's something that is working well, stick with it and focus instead on the areas that need real improvement. Consistency in strong execution leads to better results than constantly reinventing the wheel. There's been a lot of new blood at the company over the last 12-18 months, which has been good for staying fresh, but there's also a lot of legacy knowledge floating around with the people who helped grow the company to where it's at today. Listen to these people - they're still here for a reason.

- Top management is very high quality with hardly any turnover because of their effectiveness and ability to get the most out of their teams.
- Work / life balance is in the culture of the company.
- Employees are not micro-managed and the company rewards great work with career growth.
- Lunch is provided 4 days a week and while that seems like an excessive perk to some, it helps build closeness in teams and keeps people motivated to get back to work quickly instead of having to go out and search for lunch.
- A challenging work environment in an industry that changes quicker than most. This may be a negative for some, but it makes for an exciting place to work.
- The company recently hired a top-notch CFO who has already made a very positive impact.","I'm not sure this is necessarily a con, but I feel it's worth mentioning. As the company continues to navigate the social SaaS market, there have been and will continue to be bumps along the way. Management is highly determined with aggressive growth plans which often results in positive outcomes, but can lead to disappointment when some of those aggressive growth plans aren't met at times.","Management at the company is doing a lot of the correct things. I recently have come to appreciate how the company is aligning the workforce. This has had the benefit of creating a unified team that is moving forward toward a common goal which is to be the best company in this market. A few other things:
- Management should continue to strive to be an independent company because this is such a great place to work. There is no reason to think this company can't succeed, creative immense value, and be around for many more years leading the social SaaS industry with their current plans to achieve smart growth.
- Continue to develop your employees by investing in training. Employees who are invested in by their employer feel more valued and will be your best employees for years to come.
- As the company moves to profitability, make sure to implement significant new employee benefits such as a 401k match.
- Continue to invest in your Downtown office. Downtown Austin is a great place to work. Please don't ever move to the suburbs which I don't foresee would ever happen. The Downtown Austin environment is perfect for a creative company like Spredfast.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2017-06-02,,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,"Two decades in professional workforce, this place is the best (by far)",More than a year,0,"I've been around the block a time or two and can say - without any doubt - that Spredfast is the best place I've ever had the pleasure of working. And I've worked at global comms firms, small advertising firms and a few in between,

Their is a true servant-leadership culture, which starts with the CEO. Does he have to make tough decisions? Of course. And I get the true sense that he doesn't do so lightly. The leadership here cares about and puts the people first. It's a growing, ever-evolving space, so yes, shifts are made, but that doesn't change the fact that the leadership here really, truly CARES.

I've had many bosses, and at Spredfast I've now had the best. Thoughtful, though, but fair, but allows me to play to my strengths, gives me (enough) freedom to do my job well and is there when I need them at the drop of a hat.

Benefits? Oh yeah. I don't think that some of the younger people who work and have worked here truly realize what they have. Yes, catered lunches four days a week. Downtown subsidized parking. Open PTO. An AMAZING work/life balance. The ability and support (and encouragement) to move to other parts of the company. To be strapped to a rocketship of a company.

But for me, the biggest thing is the people and the platform. The people are the best in the business. Talk about truly caring about their customers. They do the RIGHT thing, even if it hurts. And they care about one another, too. You get the true sense of family and togetherness, which I didn't have the ""watch your back"" global comms world. We're all in this together and rowing the same way. And you feel that everyday.

Everyday is filled with problem-solving, challenges that stretch us - but also with laughter. You are always met with a smile in these halls. I could go on and on...

Platform: The platform is reliable, easy to use/manage, and mission critical for many of our customers proving the value it delivers. The speed of delivering new capabilities has increased significantly over the years, which has helped to eliminate competitors, and retain our market leader position.
2. Services: Fantastic services organization. Our services continue to be a differentiator. This space changes every day. The focus and dedication from our services teams to adapt with the constant shifts in the market to help our customers receive value from their software investment and social media is impressive.
3. Software Development: Our product design, engineering, and product management teams are some of the best I have ever worked with. Working with the social networks is unique and challenging. It feels like the team we have built enjoys the demands of this space at least in part because they have to constantly learn to stay relevant, and develop solutions that differentiate Spredfast.
4. Leadership: The leadership team includes a great mix of executives that have a ton of experience running social media programs for large enterprises, and managing/building successful software companies. While it is impossible to address all the demands of Spredfast customers and employees, the leadership team has done a good job prioritizing what to focus on so Spredfast can continue to help customers achieve their business objectives, AND manage a healthy company. They are also eager to engage with customers/prospects to help develop recommendations that address their needs, and transparently answer general questions about the company.
5. Sales: Management tends to hire experienced sales reps. They put a lot of trust in the people they hire to get the job without a ton of hand holding. While management is always available to help, reps need to own their success, or they will fail.
6. People: The best thing about Spredfast is the people.

Generally: It's fun to be a part of one of the most well-known/successful startups in Austin. Even in SF/NY, it's not uncommon for someone to recognize our brand within the marketing world.

People: It's pretty rare to be a part of a company that's grown to the size that we have so quickly, but still held onto most of the startup vibe. One pro is that the 2 other companies we merged with also had good people/vibes so we were able to blend together pretty quickly. Most people have a work hard/play hard attitude. Those who are ambitious move up/get promoted.

Food perks: Generally healthy options are always available, and the selection can be over the top sometimes: Whole Foods every day for lunch, every possible Lacroix/soda/coffee/snack/cereal/etc that I can even think of. Other perks are subsidized gym, parking, etc.. and free massages & unlimited vacation.

Management: Most of the leadership team has been through this stage of growth at a tech company before. Since they've ""seen the movie before"", it helps to keep everyone pointed in the right direction even when the pace of change in the social/marketing space is so quick.

Financial: Most people would say they get paid what they're worth, sometimes more. Great options for 401k, insurance, maternity leave, etc.","Generally: Growing pains have happened which is probably to be expected at this point. Too many internal systems to navigate both for admin purposes & activities related to different parts of the org.

People: Depending on the type of job you have, and the style of your manager, the expectations can be different for performance/face time/etc. Some people have been known to get liberal with the WFH & unlimited vacation policies.

Perks: Even though the office is really nice, it would be pretty cool to have everyone in 1 space, on 1 floor, all together (split between 2 floors in the same building currently). It's hard to complain about free lunch but it would also be nice to have hot breakfast/dinner like facebook/google have.

- A solid, quality, reliable product.
- Nice offices (if you're in Austin). The 3rd floor takeover last year made a big difference: it feels like a SV startup, with a nice open space for company meetings.
- Global footprint: London + Sydney.
- An interesting/evolving space that is continuing to grow rapidly.
- A world class customer summit.
- Beer on tap, a well stocked snack cabinet and catered lunches four days a week.
- Competitive pay for many.
- Convenient downtown parking lot.
- Perfect for people who like the color orange.","- No clear company strategy, other than to disparage competitors.
- Incredibly Austin-centric: fine if you're based here, but there is a constant drum beat from outside of Austin complaining about how hard it is to get things done if you're not there, and how people and teams outside of Austin are essentially invisible.
- A marketing team that doesn't generate leads (according to the sales team) or have an attribution program that sales recognizes or understands. There is constant friction between 'revenue marketing' and sales. How does a revenue marketing team not have an attribution model?
- There are many inexperienced people in senior roles, leading to a wildly differing experiences from team to team.
- A leadership team, of a social media company, that is barely active in social media, beyond scheduled auto-posts presented as 'social selling'. Let that sink in. Today is April 16th, the CEO, Rod Favaron, hasn't tweeted since March 12th. Smart social?
- The CRO, Eric Anderson, openly mocks employees and has childish nicknames for everyone on his team. Think Wall Street circa 1985. An email sales guy, he has brought that email sales mentality to Spredfast.
- White, white, white. Spredfast is whiter than Trump's cabinet, which at least has one or two non-white faces to twenty crusty white men. The lack of diversity is incredible.
- A human resources department that is stretched so thin as to be close to useless. One person handles benefits for a company of 500 (!). Unsurprisingly, the level of service delivered is very low, particularly for non Austin people (notice a theme here?). Basic mistakes are made on things like election of benefits and tax withholdings. You need to triple check everything yourself. Good luck navigating that attitude, too.
- Bizarre, childish focus on the #1 player in the space, to a fault. Spredfast lives so much in Sprinklr's shadow, it's painful. The CEO likes to talk about Sprinklr dumpster fires, yet somehow Sprinklr has 3x the employees Spredfast does, and got 2x the funding round last year. It is very evident that that stings.","- Get rid of the 'sales bro' culture. Everyone in tech in Austin can see the way the company has changed in the last 18 months, and it's not good.
- Work on addressing the 'big fish small pond' issue. Spredfast is big in Austin, but barely registers in SV, NYC or London.
- Work on the company's diversity. In 2017 there's no excuse for being so painfully white. Diversity is strength.
- Acknowledge that competitors have strengths. The constant, childish trashing of them just makes you look weak.",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

 - Opportunities to stretch your skills and learn new things in your role
 - Fast pace and varied demands mean you'll never get bored","- Parking costs $80 / month, so those free lunches pretty much get canceled out
 - No 401k matching and you get laughed at by the CEO for asking if/when this is coming. Seriously.
 - Considering the size and age of the company, you would expect some of the nimble, flexibility of a startup. Not so. The level of politicking and legacy baggage various teams maintain means that multiple committees and several months are required to make even the smallest common sense change to any given process.
 - The quality of your experience is 100% dependent on the quality of your manager. Unfortunately, there is no real development language used to help advance career paths and management seems to have just given in to the fact that people will bounce, so internal growth and development is extremely rare. Those who do advance do so because of back-alley deals and barters, not because of normally-tracked growth and accomplishment of goals. There simply aren't positions defined for advancement, so you either hope your manager is willing to face a battle to create a Sr role (or similar) or you're forced to change paths if you want to stay at the company but continue to develop your career.
 - Questionable hiring decisions of leadership roles (VP+) means you are constantly starting over to assert your abilities, gain recognition, and/or move ahead.
 - Executive leadership bounces from one dramatic move or direction to another on an almost quarterly basis, so things always feel in upheaval and there is little sense of stability or security. Sometimes these radical choices create problems that require months to resolve... and it's hard to win back trust after those missteps.
 - This doesn't seem to be a place for people who want to start or grow their family. Spredfast burns people out and offers very lean maternity benefits; is it really just a boys club or for single women in their 20s?","Decide exactly what you want and move towards it, communicate this to your employees in no uncertain terms, and start fostering and nurturing the careers of the cogs who make it all happen if you hope to keep them long enough to achieve whatever it is you're after.",3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

Salary was decent and within market value, although chances for advancement are slim. There are some great things that the product does within the market and the open platform philosophy is smart and a great selling point to customers.","The company that I was sold on slowly disintegrated from the time I started to the time I left. It is quite clear that they are aggressively looking to be acquired or IPO and every decision made in support of that has changed the culture of the company in a truly negative way. The values that they preach of openness, transparency, and collaboration are a sham. They are selling themselves in the market as folksy, friendly, and doing things with customer success in mind, however actions speak much louder than words and their recent actions are in direct opposition to what they espouse.

If you don't work in the Austin office, good luck trying to get support or career advancement. There seems to be a huge disconnect in the management figuring out how to run a global company and it shows in the way they treat their ""satellite"" employees.

Career advancement is virtually non-existent and considering the direction the company is heading, it would be tough to get ahead with the already slim opportunities and the money-hungry executive team fixated on the appearance of profitability. They are shifting to a sales-centric organization and slashing resources that support successful long-term customer relationships. I have seen smart, kind, innovative people savagely lose their jobs so that the entire organization is now inefficiently top heavy.

The product team is becoming quite a mess as resources are shifted, unbalanced, and redistributed to achieve short-sighted goals.","The actions and decisions made over the last several months are defining the kind of company that you are. No matter how many times you say that you're open and care about putting the customer first, your pursuit of an attractive bottom line exposes your true priorities and intentions. You cannot claim that you care about building partnerships with customers and then eliminate more than half of the ecosystem that supports your customers without a long-term plan. Employees should not care more about the customer than the management. In pursuit of hastening ""profitability"" your reputation and relationships are being damaged by the folly of short-sightedness.

As a remote employee, I never felt as though I was part of the team-- and I later realized I wasn't. If you aren't in Austin, you basically aren't part of the org; no matter the revenue you generate, responsibilities you oversee etc, you are nonexistent. After multiple requests for on-site attendance from upper management, not one was trip made. Many times 1x1's were canceled at the last minute, feedback was limited at best, absolutely zero upward mobility (even when YOU take the initiative as employee to do so). Spredfast is also very very good at appearing warm, welcoming, #free #open #fun etc but in fact, I've never felt more distrusting of an organization in my life. It's extremely two faced and dishonest, all while blaming everyone/everything but themselves. Reading HR responses here, its infuriating as it's not ""growth"" or ""moving fast"" or “employees not speaking up” yadda yadda yadda….that causes these issues; it's poor leadership, an absurd boys club culture, a false sense of security and lots of lip service. I used to love our CEO as I felt he was fair, a force in the industry, involved and quite frankly a great person overall. That quickly changed when meetings became childish chants about killing our competitors for several minutes. Enough already. He also brought in the folks that have since taken the company on a big downward spiral, so that's another strike against him. It's not a coincidence that several reviews state the same thing-- if you voice your opinion, aren’t a pushover or professionally disagree with something, you'd better have a job offer; your days are numbered.","1) Get rid of the boys club mentality. It's quite dumb and just a really really bad look.
2) If you REALLY want to attract and RETAIN top talent, learn how to treat those that work there; allow them to express their opinions about product concerns, management issues, internal workflows and customer complaints. Quit retaliating against those who disagree with decisions; it's obvious and tacky.
3) Provide ACTUAL opportunities to grow; top employees want a place with upward mobility and that's a good thing. Stop promoting those who shouldn't be managing teams or overseeing large clients.
4) Practice what you preach. Stop blaming everyone for the problems at this company. The executives that have been brought in are NOT the right people to run this org and it's obvious on many levels.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

2016-09-11, Front End Web Developer,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Stay Away From Custom Team,Less than a year,0,"I absolutely loved the work I did. I got to work on something new every 3-4 weeks and most of the time it was incredibly challenging and therefore engaging for me. I learned SO much in the time that I was there. If management were different, and if Spredfast's approach to custom sales were more modern (in line with other agencies doing similar work; i.e. less black-box, less waterfall) then I think that it would have been a much more enjoyable place to work.

I worked with a pretty great group of people. Hard-working and optimistic in the face of some incredibly challenging work conditions. They for the most part seemed to enjoy what they did and tried to give it their all - it is nice to work with people who care about what they do.

The rest of Spredfast (outside of the custom team, and Austin location only) seemed really cool. If given the option, I would have chosen to change to a different team. I had a lot of respect for the other development teams, they seemed like the had some really good standards and structure around their process and there were a lot of really smart people. I also think that the other products were really neat and would have been interesting to work on. I can't speak much for the other Spredfast offices, but on a couple of occasions that I worked with their developers, it wasn't a great experience. I think the Austin office has higher standards.","The custom team is a mess. If you are a developer, do not go near it. There is a reason that almost no developer on that team lasts more than a year before finding a new job, switching teams (voluntarily), or getting fired. The custom team chews people up and spits them out. There is no work/life balance to speak of. Expressing concerns about this leads to responses like 'well when you start logging 60 hour weeks, then we'll know we need to hire more people to share the workload' yet logging more than 40 hours was frowned upon since we were doing contract work and we were almost always over on our hours anyways. It was sort of an unspoken expectation and everyone seemed to be in a constant state of stress and exhaustion.

The team as a whole (no one person's fault) was also incredibly resistant to change. It took months to start trying something new, and then it was usually only a half-hearted attempt so it never stuck. Things like agile development, automated testing, code reviews, no meeting Wednesdays, a 1-hour hackathon knock-off, designated time periods to take questions to reduce interruptions ('office hours'), 'lunch & learn' type meetings... These were all things we tried to implement in the time I was there to various degrees of success (or failure as it were.) If you join this team hoping you can make a difference and turn it around, you are going to be disappointed.","Please care about your employees. It seemed like the only people interested in an individual's happiness, the success and awesomeness of a product, the process and streamlining workflow to make our jobs easier, the learning and growth of an employee (etc...) was NOT management. Please care about these things more so that your employees are well taken care of and happy. So many times I felt like I was fighting to change something just so that I (and coworkers) could be happy at work, and all I got was resistance from management. I felt expendable - which, it turns out I was!",2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0
2016-08-12,,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,"Once great, now circling the drain",More than 3 years,0,"A few great people to work with, but far less than there used to be.

Decent starting salaries.","- Terrible insurance. No excuse for a company of this size.

- Impotent raises. As a rule I don't talk about salaries with coworkers while I work for a company, but after I was laid off I discussed it and no one got more than a 3% raise.

- No bonuses except for...

- Sales gets bonuses for projects, but the people who implement the projects get squat.

- No transparency. Decisions made seem random and foolish, and they can't seem otherwise since nothing is ever discussed.

- Roughly 300 layers of management. OK, an exaggeration, but honestly I never could figure out why I had at least 6 layers of management between me and the CEO. Although not a small company it's not a large one either.

- Ever-shifting management. Not only were there an excessive number of layers of management, the sections kept changing as did the people running them, not to mention the turnover. In my time there, I had 4 different department managers, and 4 different section managers.

- Inept management:
1) I watched the most immensely profitable section of the company wither and die away simply because upper management tried to shove a square peg into a round hole.
2) Bringing up problems is the surest way to be put on the bubble.
3) Several coworkers lost their job because of their managers ego. The people who did the actual work got laid off, while the manager continued on. These managers were later laid off themselves, but it never should have happened in that order.

Honestly I could go on, but there's little point. I don't want to sound petty, its just there are so many intrinsic issues that I don't see the company surviving much longer.","Try to remember your startup roots.

Spredfast is a great place to work in that the perks really provide a sense of pride and community -- free lunches, overflowing snacks, beer on tap, etc. They throw huge brand awareness events that cement their name in the marketplace and the city. You get to work with some of the most prestigious brands in the world. If you are entry level, Spredfast is a great introduction tot he world of SaaS, social media, startups, enterprise technology and business. You will work alongside some of the most prolific thought leaders in the industry and also important names in the general ATX tech world. Work/life balance is valued and it is an extremely friendly and collaborative atmosphere. There are specific times of year where the company comes together to work on interdepartmental passion projects that both strengthen the community culture of the organization but also the products.

Working at Spredfast equipped me with the skills and experience needed to launch my career to the next level...but at another company. Which brings me to the cons which you can find in more detail below and are important to note.","LACK OF CAREER ADVANCEMENT: Manager's lack of commitment to professional development (particularly in the services organization, where pay is not competitive) has caused Spredfast to lose top talent to other startups and tech companies in the city. There are whisperings about this being addressed now. They have a solid lead of talent and development on board who pushes managers to make these changes -- however, the data speaks for itself and employees continue to leave Spredfast for this reason. Kombucha and beer on tap can only keep employees for so long. Snacks don't always translate to real appreciation or compensation. Without clear and methodical approaches to career advancement and professional growth, Spredfast will continue this trend. They do not use any real rubric to measure performance and as result, promotions are simply based on politics and glaring organizational gaps rather than merit. There are, however, a few select people who have moved up continuously in the organization due to perceived favoritism.

LACK OF SYNERGY BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS: This is a problem at almost any SaaS company. But for Spredfast, it's more of an organizational issue rather than heads butting between departments. Several job titles perform the same job, for different kinds and amounts of compensation. Way too many cooks in the kitchen on one account -- causing confusion for clients and frustration between departments. And sales general lack of understanding of product causes for over-promising to clients

HOLDING ON TO STALE TALENT: Like another reviewer commented, because of the familial culture of the organization, mediocre talent still exists in the office. Again, without a true rubric to measure performance, Spredfast lacks the infrastructure and systems to trim the fat of such people. This was particularly detrimental when a handful of sales hires were brought on whose knowledge of the industry was so low that the org suffered for about 2 quarters, causing the competition to rise above.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

I have received more recognition in two years at the company, than I have in 10+ years on the agency side. My contributions are appreciated, and I'm regularly rewarded in compensation, promotion, awards, but even more important, in the quality feedback from leadership, managers and junior staff.
