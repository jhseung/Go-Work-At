There's still a lot of work to be done to break out of the monolithic codebase.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2019-03-08, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Best place I have ever worked,Less than a year,0,"- We have a great educational culture. For me, the most important thing I was looking for was investment in my engineering education, and that's happened on both a team/manager level and department wide. We have many internal educational programs (lectures, workshops, funding for conferences and educational materials, mentorship program, access to Udemy courses, etc), and my managers have been fully supportive of helping me transition to fullstack engineer. I mean, I am working right now with one of the founders on Django on an educational project. That's so awesome in and of itself.

- We have a great engineering culture. We have a healthy culture of feedback and discussion - I feel like we are always discussing the best way to accomplish things, and people are really passionate about finding the right way forward that's the best for everyone.

- I really believe in the product and mission. Our goals are to help create live experiences as well as support our event creators, which is something I can definitely get behind, having been an event planner in a previous life.

- I get to bring my whole self to work, and get to do all the things I'm interested in. I'm not only interested in coding - I also love education and diversity initiatives, and have been allowed work time to accomplish things like an internal mentorship program and bringing diverse groups into our space.

- We have a great culture overall. Management is celebratory of the work we do, without being too over the top and flashy (unlike some other companies in the area). We have lots of great internal events as well. Also, I really feel like management cares about both the employees and customers. Management is constantly asking for feedback and acting upon it.

- I have lots of opportunity for growth and promotion, and options available to pursue the career path I want - either continuing to be an individual contributor or go into management. I've also had multiple directors across different departments take interest in my career growth and offer their help.

- I feel like I'm being paid very fairly and there are great benefits. Good medical, and lots of really nice perks around the office - smoothie bar, in house massages/chiro, lunch is provided, snacks, commuting benefits, wellness stipend, etc.

- I am really listened to by my manager and upper management. I was rather unhappy on a project due to extenuating circumstances, and was switched to a different project that was more in line with what I want to accomplish. All of which I feel very grateful for.

- Good work-life balance. Sometimes there's a project deadline and people have to work really hard to get stuff out of the door, but in general managers are really respectful of work life balance. We also have a really good culture of being flexible with time off and working remote.

- I get to build cool stuff, working for our R&D department.

- The interview process was one of the best I've ever been through. They were willing to meet me where I was at (being a junior engineer), and my first phone screen was with a director, not a recruiter. That really left a lasting impression on me.

- Lastly, the people. I LOVE the people I get to work with - they are so incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and supportive. Also, just really freaking cool. Everyone has something that they are passionate about, both inside and outside of work. I have met so many amazing and inspiring people at work, and genuinely feel like I have made friends. This is probably one of the biggest factors of what's going to keep me around for a long time.

All in all, I can't recommend Eventbrite enough. I love it here, plain and simple.","The internal development environment has been really difficult to work with in the past - lots of lost time and productivity.

We don't have an official QA department. That sometimes is a bit concerning.

Sometimes our internal culture isn't as cohesive as I would like - both SF wide and engineering as well. I do feel connected to other offices, as we have had opportunity to visit and work with each other which I feel grateful for. But I thankfully have friends across all the departments, which makes it feel a lot smaller.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Benefits are good, but salaries still aren't competitive against similarly-sized companies in the Bay Area.

A lot of folks are operating like we're still a startup underdog, but others expect us to act like a huge, cautious company. That tension can be confusing and leads to mixed messages from our leaders. Not everyone in a leadership position is qualified or ready to lead other people, so be prepared to lean on their peers for help.

We were largely centralized in SF for a really long time, so the transition to being a global company with teams spanning continents has been a tricky one.

2018-08-13, Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Horrible 2-Year Experience,More than a year,0,"Usual perks: free food/snacks, coffee, health benefits, nice office","I quit Eventbrite as soon as I was able. Despite the nice office/perks and facade of a ""fun company culture"", I did not enjoy working at Eventbrite. Don't be fooled by all the hyped 5-star reviews by entry-level new hires who don't know any better (yet).

1. Senior leader(s) of my department created a toxic, uncomfortable working environment. Complained to me about my own peers/colleagues, putting them down behind their backs. I've never experienced such unprofessionalism, and I was really disappointed about this. Given how frequently this happened, it was very hard to trust my managers: seeing them pretend to care about an employee, only to turn around the next moment and complain about them. I don't doubt that they've done the same to me.

2. Unappreciative. Leaders take their most diligent employees for granted. Constantly made heavy demands of the team to meet deadlines, but did NOT take the time to understand whether we had enough resources. Because of this, team would kill themselves working long hours just to hit deadlines, and management WON'T go out of their way to acknowledge dedication and hard work. On the other hand, if anything is less-than-perfect, then fingers ARE pointed and you'll get facetime with upper management to talk about what they don't like about you or your work.

3. No actual work/life balance. I was expected to return emails/calls in the evenings at home and while I was on vacation. I felt judged by my leaders whenever I asked to take any of my ""unlimited PTO"", even though I took less PTO than most others on my team. They were definitely counting days and letting you know they didn't like it.

4. Clique-y and cultist culture. Like a few others here have written, if you don't live and breathe Eventbrite, you don't fit in. Managers show favoritism.",Seriously evaluate your leaders. Eventbrite doesn't practice what they preach.,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0
2018-07-02,,"Nashville, TN",Current Employee ,It's Seriously Amazing! Phenomenal Place To Work In Nashville!,Less than a year,0,"Amazing tech company that is large, but not too large (if that makes sense). There's an entrepreneurial spirit pulsing through the atmosphere that is both inspiring and challenging. Working at Eventbrite helps me feel like I'm accomplishing meaningful product output and contributing to an overall organization that knows what its goals are and where it is heading into the future. Not to mention, Eventbrite excels at offering not just competitive, but truly phenomenal benefit packages, work/life balance and options to work-from-home, catered daily lunch (plus breakfast & snack options!), continued learning and growth opportunities, and more. The leadership from the top down to my own people manager is positive, personalized, and inspiring. I love working here!","It's hard to think of anything that's ""wrong"" here. Would higher pay be nice? Of course (when would it not be?). Would additional benefits like a student loan repayment program be helpful? Yes. However, there is already so much offered, it feels greedy to ask for more. That being said, I have very clear goals and objectives, so that I know when the time comes, I can point to everything I've accomplished and that could open the door to a discussion about compensation. It's not something that's ""taboo"" or off limits. Eventbrite wants me to grow.

The company is growing quickly! It's difficult to keep up with everything happening, so I think there could be some focused new-hire training/education on all the various teams and departments. This would provide insights into what everyone across the company is working towards and accomplishing.","Keep it up! You're doing a stellar job.

The company benefits are very fair and the new 401k match is an exciting improvement. The recent work HR did to relevel comp according to market rate was a much needed remedy to our historically below-market pay. It finally feels more equitable to the rest of the tech world in San Francisco.

The leadership culture is evolving for the better as well. I feel proud to work for Julia and believe she is an empathetic leader who truly cares about each employee (especially welcomed in the current ""me too"" political climate). It's a relief to say that Eventbrite has reinvigorated our HR leadership to be more active in shaping company culture and addressing personnel issues.

Work/life balance here is the best of any company I have ever worked for. Time off is not only ok, it is respected (i.e. you won't be expected to work from the beach), and being able to get home at a reasonable hour most days is such a gift.","As with any company at this stage of growth, there are times when priorities shift abruptly or things seem to be moving very quickly. There are also longtime employees who are no longer effective or mesh well with current culture, but are kept around for historical knowledge, which is frustrating.","Continue operating in an open, transparent fashion - that goes a long way for employees.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

EB is best described as a superficial culture that lacks genuine interaction -- the leaders I worked with pretended to care and be on your side but would conspire against you and shut themselves off from all forms of communication. I often times would come into work and have to guess if my manager was having a bad day and if they'll deflect their negativity onto me.

The people I worked with were all intelligent and respectable, but there were plenty of moments where they leveraged that and became condescending. Definitely a culture of flexing and seeing who has the bigger stick. Additionally, if your work is not your life, and you are not constantly thinking about ""Eventbrite,"" you will have a very tough time connecting with anyone. Here, you have to be all about Eventbrite or you're out.

Eventbrite prides itself for its work life balance and even has an unlimited PTO plan for its employees, however, they hardly practice what they preach. Unlimited PTO is pretty much a myth used as a pitch to get you to sign on with them. I had a vacation planned and gave my manager plenty of notice ahead of time and was still hounded for responses and work during that time -- is it not common sense to respect my personal time? Don't be fooled by the benefits and the people. Easily the worst place I've worked in my career.","The CEO is a great woman and leader that I personally loved to talk to, but it's a shame that other leaders can't take after that and keep their power trip to themselves.

- Some of the management here has no business being people managers. I think you'll find this is a common theme among some of the reviews here.
- Review process was a joke, so your feedback on your manager won't make a difference.
- Poor transparency and communication. People you are working with on projects would be let go, and it would not be communicated to you.
- It was a very sales/marketing driven company when I left, which also suggests weak Engineering leadership at the executive level.

2018-01-22,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,The most fulfilling and challenging professional experience I've had to date.,More than 3 years,0,"For me, the most important things to find in a company are tough problems to solve, inspiring co-workers, and collaboration. Over the past few years at Eventbrite, I can say without a doubt that I am having the most fulfilling and challenging professional experience I've had to date.

We're at a really interesting point in the Eventbrite's journey, where we are big enough that have resources to go after crazy challenges, but small enough that not everything is figured out yet. After about 6 months of establishing that I was competent at my job, I have felt continuously pushed to raise my hand and solve tough problems. I've gotten to take on responsibilities that are usually reserved for high level management, and I get to work strategically while also getting my hands dirty. I can honestly say I've learned more in my few years here than I had in my whole career prior, and I think the experience I've gotten here sets me up well for the rest of my career. I've always felt encouraged to seek that career growth within Eventbrite.

Solving tough problems is more fun when you work with impressive people, and I feel lucky to be surrounded by some really brilliant individual contributors and inspirational leaders. Even as Eventbrite grows, there is a feeling of a family that Julia has found a way to keep around.

What continues to inspire me about Eventbrite is the spirit of collaboration. Over the past year, and definitely for the next few years to come, we will be figuring out how to work together as a large global company. While these growing pains are really hard to go through for any company, I feel strongly that we will excel - simply due to our dedication to collaboration. I've seen many cross-functional projects exceed expectations, and I've seen us gracefully move through large acquisitions - and it all comes down to collaboration. At the end of the day, we get to solve tough problems, with smart colleagues, and we are dedicated to working together to make it happen. After a few years, that still gets me excited to come to work every day.","Over the past 2.5 years, we expanded globally very aggressively. We added offices in new countries and added a lot of new Britelings - both organically and via acquisition. This was not an easy expansion to go through.

For me, the biggest downfall of the expansion we've gone through was the fear that our culture could be diluted. There were times when it felt like we were making decisions based 100% on what was good for the bottom line, and losing our focus on growing a people-first, ""best company to work for.""

While I would say there were a handful of cons that came with this growth (RIFs, lack of focus on global competitive total compensation, feelings of distrust and lack of a clear path forward), I have started to see a clear shift back to our goal of becoming the best ticketing technology company AND the best company to work for - in tandem. This shift is noticeable, especially with the hiring of Omer Cohen, our new Chief People officer, and that prompted me to write this review.","Over the past 6 months, there has been a clear shift towards reclaiming our ""best place to work"" focus. I've noticed changes in how transparent e-staff is, I've noticed more input from middle management around the globe, and I've noticed a big change in focus on career growth, L&D, and Total Rewards since Omer joined.

I remember walking into Eventbrite in 2011 for my interview and I could feel the energy. I saw smiles on every employees face. The office had a Disneyland vide - 'happiest place on earth.""","The company culture changed drastically as Eventbrite grew and executives were shuffling in and out of VP and C-level roles. Eventbrite stopped interviewing for culture fit, negatively affecting team and cross functional team dynamics.

My last few years at Eventbrite, I would wake up and not want to go to work. I didn't care for my coworkers and I didn't feel upper management, or even my manager, cared for me. I also struggled with a few ethical issues the last few months of my time at Eventbrite. I was asked by HR to lie to my coworkers, I was also told by HR that there would be times in my career where ""I wouldn't have a life outside of work."" That conversation with HR was the straw that broke the camels back for me. It also supported my observation on the company culture changing dramatically - no work/life balance directly being communicated to employees from an HR representative.",Advice to upper management - go to your bottom line workers and ask for their feedback on their experience and manager.

The people, culture, environment, etc is incredible. I have never been happier with a company and, at this point in my life, I can honestly say that I don't see myself leaving any time in the near future.

The company is very transparent with everything that that can be and I feel constantly supported by my supervisor. They are sincerely invested in your growth and career path. I have had the opportunity to transfer into three different positions so far during my time here and I constantly see people getting promoted internally and given the opportunity to interview for many different teams/positions. They are very invested in their employees and highly encourage a work-life balance and opportunities to shadow other teams for new opportunities within the company.

Bottom line- I love working at Eventbrite and cannot speak highly enough about it!","We have grown rapidly and that can make finding a conference room challenging at times, so I would like to see investment in additional private meeting spaces at some of our offices, but otherwise I sincerely love working here and really can't think of many other cons.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

There is so much transparency, and ability to ask questions to management up to CEO level, but you have to take advantage of the opportunities. (ie: asking questions in Hearts to Hartz and being open in team meetings and your 1:1's with your manager if you have questions or issues to address)

Don't get fooled by high ratings. They are from young new hires who are fascinated by free coffee, snacks, and energy drinks. This place has massive deep-rooted problems that are not going away.

- Managers - extremely incompetent, inexperienced, unprofessional. One manager openly said ""Its like high school here... CS, Developers are the nerds, and sales are the popular kids"" I thought this was funny and meant as a joke -- but she and most of the sales team genuinely believe that... this brought up SO MUCH Politics - all this makes it impossible to get things done

- No opportunities for career development and nobody really cares about developing talent. You are blindly promised development, training -- but instead you are given 1-on-1 with your managers that are not helpful. They say they are open to questions at any time ... I asked a question once and they said ""what? thats a weird question..? kinda dumb?"" I get you want to foster a competitive spirit in the office - but thats just bullying and not helpful

- During my interview, I had mentioned I had wanted to go back to school... I was promised tuition reimbursement, time off, flexible schedule, and more. But after joining the team, all dreams of going back to school and pursuing an MBA were met by odd looks and ""oh... why??"" or ""no... we don't have a tuition reimbursement program""

- This place fires people all the time and not in a nice way - you will be doing everything perfectly and arrive one day to your desk being cleaned and you being escorted out the building in front of everyone.

Please do yourself a favor and review profiles of Engineering managers at EvenBrite before considering taking a job here. Be careful of not hurting manager's ego even accidentally and unintentionally, or be ready to be terminated at any minute. Seeing your colleagues suddenly getting disappeared is a norm here.

Communicating indirectly behind the back and in the groups is the accepted practice here. Meetings are used for discovering what other thinks. There is just weird tendency of agreeing as group. People Don't raise genuine issues and express honest opinions as they fear getting isolated and retaliation from rest of the group. Even long-time employees don't speak a word as they are waiting for an IPO to encash their stock options.

It is the worst quality code base I have ever seen in my long career. Accruing technical debt is encouraged as inexperienced managers attempts to direct entry level developers without any planning and design. Much of the code is a monolith and remains unchanged since inception. Tight coupling, circular dependencies and code duplication is common occurrence. Unfortunately in the absence of mentorship and guidance , young developers write best what they can. There are no architects around.

There is no thought leadership other than repeated attempts to induce excitements by announcing birthdays and anniversaries, cheering inter-project movement and celebrating festivals. There is nothing wrong with celebration. However there ia a lot of faux-positivity. Most young employees are attracted by this, free food, shower in the office and relaxed work environment. However there is no real growth and in absence of challenges and mentorhip, there isn't much to learn.

Salary is subpar as compared to average salaries in SF. Beware of those stock options as the strike price is very high. When you are granted $40K of stocks every year, you are getting $65k of options that you can exercise only if you pay $25k in cash. Since it is private equity, you cannot sell your stocks until company goes an IPO or mgmt gets approved investors. It means your money is stuck if you decide to leave. There is no 401k match. no bonuses. No PTOs and no cash payment for PTOs.

Unlimited TTYN policy isn't same as unlimited PTOs. Per CA laws, employees earn PTO/ vacation time and it is your right to spend the way you want. With unlimited time-off, it is on the discretion to your manager to approve your time-off. You may be asked to reduce your vacation, participate into meetings and supporting 'business' during your time-off.

There is no work methodology followed here. Company has recently started introducing Scrum(in 2017) and most teams don't like it. Basically running projects with no focus and hiding failures behind excuses and allegations is the preferred way. Often decisions are based on individual biases without considering any data points. No wonder why many project fails and company is struggling to make profits. Also very few customers bring repeat business and many of themare tired of technology issues and high fees. Management has shifted its strategy to acquire companies as it cannot fix inherent problems and grow organically. Management is aware that without consistent growth company cannot go for IPO.

Performance is reviewed every quarter. When the project fails, engineering manager starts finding a scapegoat, blame failures on that person and fire him. I have seen this pattern repeating numerous times. I have even witnessed people getting extremely positive review in last quarter but fired within a month for performance reasons. Make sure to dine and drink with your group members and build a personal relationship or you are next in the line.

I have seen many il-managed companies in my long career. But this one is the worst. Everyone in middle and top management has an inflated ego.

Other cons - only 1 restroom with 4 lavatories for an office space of 50,000 sq ft and among ~300 people. Long queues in the morning is norm. Loud rock music in the restroom doesn't help so please stop playing it.
It is imposdible to find a conference for next 2 days.","To middle management: Try introspecting at least once to find out root causes instead of blaming failures. Take some training in people management if you are inexperienced.or if you need it. Your job is to help your team resolving blockers so better start running 1:1s with agenda and have an action items out of each meeting. 1:1s isn't meant for gossips and finding scapegoats.

To top management - Hope you know what happens at ground-level. Please be aware who is fired and hired. Many good employees are leaving because of incompetent and egoistic middle management.

They would give inconsistent feedback and empty promises on career growth and advancement. Their entire team has now left the company.

3. Compensation is below market rates. Management tries to bake the perks of the company into your package, however, this should be an added bonus, not part of your yearly compensation.

4. Part of the motivation driver of the sales team is fear. There is a top-down culture that creates politics and tension.

1. My coworkers: there is no one at Eventbrite who doesn't want to talk to you, teach you things, learn from you, and improve the product together. It's a really unique group of people.
2. My projects: eng does a mix of new projects & keeping down tech debt, so there's always a mix of learning from existing code and getting to build entirely new stuff.
3. The product: it's awesome working on a product that has such a huge impact on small businesses in tons of different verticals, AND on a product that most of your friends & family actively use.
4. Culture at large: Eventbrite's culture is focused on allowing employees to be their ""whole selves"" at work. This sounds corporate-speak-y but I think they're succeeding at making a place where a wide variety of people can feel comfortable being themselves.","Like any tech company that's been around for 5+ years, some of our code base is messy and outdated in ways that aren't ideal. More investment in our technology infrastructure would help the engineering teams move faster in the long run.

Like almost all tech companies, we have a fairly un-diverse engineering team, though our ""diversity numbers"" are better than some. I believe eng leadership is interested in keeping our existing employees happy and intelligently addressing issues that come up for women & people of color in the workplace, but there is room for improvement in our recruitment & retention work.","Keep up all your good work!!

My largest concern was getting lost in the shuffle, and my product not mattering to anybody nearly as much as it mattered to me. Our company, Queue, was acquired by Eventbrite because of our ability to build so much with such a small team (currently, 3 engineers). The two attributes of Eventbrite, and the team surrounding the acquisition, was recognizing that and making sure we stayed relatively autonomous, yet still ""included"" (if that makes sense).

If you want the juice, here it is:
* Medical/Dental/Vision benefits are incredible, and the employer covers quite a large portion of dependent coverage as well
* Pay is adequate. Not the most I've been offered in the city, but provides for a great quality of life while my partner is able to stay home and raise our child
* Catered lunches in the main offices (since we work remote, they add a lunch allowance) are always delicious
* Snacks, Red Bull, all the fuel you need throughout the day
* Top of the line hardware, I didn't have to haggle for extra RAM or CPU, I was just given the best and latest MBP upon arrival","There is a singular con (I've been working here for six months), and I don't believe it to be a fault of Eventbrite, but the fault of a company with any size: meetings. As I've stated before, I've worked in tiny companies. To push an idea forward, somebody had to say something out loud. In a room of 10 people max, it always gets heard.

One day it's mobile, the next day it could be Eventbrite hair care products (you can never predict it).

- Nepotism seems like a problem you'd never encounter in your adult life, but it's a reality at Eventbrite. I've seen someone placed in a position that they were not qualified to handle. I've seen a different person repeatedly make big promises, sink a ton of money into them, and have nothing to show for it. It's difficult to ignore the relationships they have with executives and how those relationships influence what's expected of them. At the end of the day, they'll still be employed and the projects swept under the rug. This subject was only discussed behind closed doors, but was a huge distraction and had a negative impact on the morale of many of my coworkers. Middle management would never surface it in fear for their own standing, which I completely understand.","Data should be the driving force behind every project until the company becomes profitable.

Every part of the company seems populated by competent, motivated, and intelligent people. On the engineering side, I've had the privilege to work with colleagues I respect and admire. Feedback is part of the development cycle, and these same people are generally willing to jump in and take a look at work to suggest improvements, best practices, and architecture.

Ticketing/e-commerce is now commoditized SAAS and the company's ""strategic"" projects has failed to deliver any differentiation. Both Product and Strategy teams have abandoned the marketplace mission as they struggle to make Eventbrite a destination page for event discovery. Instead the team executes multi-year efforts on refreshing the look and feel of the website to occupy time and without substantial metrics impact. The Engineering team moves at glacial speeds and mostly comes from other events-oriented SAAS companies (read: never worked at pedigree like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc). This breads an engineering culture that lacks real processes or documentation. The ""bench strength"" has never worked on large-scale services at aforementioned firms and thus many of its services/experiences have broken under larger loads. This lack of know-how also creates a fear of touching legacy code, building hack upon hack. Recent acquisitions have built off-shore engineering centers making it even harder to develop.

This is the greatest company for engineers who want to learn, grow, and collaborate with others. They have a team of engineers who are really smart but at the same time very personable.

The culture at EventBrite seems to fit the individual; if you're the type who wants to work alone, that's fine, but if you need help, just ask for it. I haven't met a single person I would hesitate to work with. We have 2 remote engineering teams in Mendoza and Nashville, both of these teams are great and easy to work with. To break up the work we host meetups, have beer on tap, clap when we are excited about something, and give out gnome awards.

Leadership takes time for both small and large group meetings where tough topics are discussed with transparency and input is genuinely solicited.

It's the first job I've had where I can picture my career growth very long term, and plan to be here for as long as I can.

The totally unique amazing thing they have (that I've never heard of another company, let along tech company) having is such amazing support for new moms. They were great about supporting my maternity leave and transition back and, this is the kicker, they have the most amazing ""Mom Rooms"" ever. There are two rooms that both have hospital grade pumps (!!!) that they give you personal parts for. There's a fridge, a cushy arm chair, and basically everything you need to be a breastfeeding and working Mom. It's out of control awesome. It's made the challenge of breastfeeding while working full time much easier, and made me much less nervous to come back.

There are a lot of other great perks (great catering, a smoothy bar with two vitamixes, yoga and massage).

* The degree of transparency is very high -- founders have weekly chats with the entire company where any question can be asked and will be answered. There is a minimum of office politics.
* Good work-life balance: unlimited PTO, managers encourage work life balance and there isn't a culture of staying in the office until midnight.

I've worked at 3 different companies before this, and can honestly say that Eventbrite is my favorite by far.","Compensation tends to be on the modest side, although in line with industry standards.

2014-08-15, Data Analyst,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Enjoyed working for Google, but LOVE working for Eventbrite even more!",More than 3 years,0,"I've been at the company, full time, for several years - here goes:

Transparency - I love how everything is communicated to the employees and how often updates are sent out. This manifests in company all hands meetings, emails, exposure to Kevin (CEO) and Julia (President) since they sit at a regular table on the main floor like all other employees, and even a ""heart to hartz"" where you can ask them any question about the company, goals, etc.

Leadership - Management is pretty awesome and the board, executive staff, and VPs are all very smart and make great decisions. Also doesnt hurt that Julia reaaaaaally cares about people and office morale and makes sure that ""wellness"" is a top company priority.

Equity/company success - I believe the company will do really well as it scales internationally and across many verticals. Its pretty nice to have equity in a soon-to-IPO company that will be massively successful.

Growth opportunities - People move around all the time. If you're a hard worker you can jump to other positions either by moving teams, or being promoted. Its awesome how Eventbrite helps its employees do what they love.

Perks - free food/snacks/beer, dogs in office, massage, yoga, acupuncture, nap room, games room, tons of offsites, opportunities to join groups for sports or similar interests, great medical/dental, wellness and transportation stipend, unlimited vacation days via a ""take the time you need"" approach, and best of all - SMART PEOPLE that are humble and fun to work with (yes, I hang out with my team outside of work because I enjoy their company!)","I've been at the company for several years and have seen how people who underperform get fired (which is fair to do), but the manner in which its communicated to employees/team members can be done better.","Please start matching 401k.

Eventbrite has been hiring very smart, motivated, and cool people to work with but then when it was time to promote them to be managers - they were first time managers that had never managed people and didnt know how to do so.

In sales there is no real career progression. As you advance, the quota gets larger, commission rates decrease, and the prospect quality / deal sizes stay the same.

Commission:
If you do decide to go to Eventbrite, be ready to reconcile every paycheck, as they are still ironing out tracking deals. Every month, my commission came in short and had to be corrected.

2019-03-12,,"Vancouver, BC (Canada)",Former Employee ,"Problems at Vancouver office potentially saved by Eventbrite brand, but history of toxic culture and high turnover",,0,"- Eventbrite has a positive brand and culture and will likely try to improve local reputation.

- Fun space to work in: events.","Do extra research and reference checks if you're looking at a job at this office. While Eventbrite has a workplace brand of being inclusive, diverse, and supportive, this office has a reputation of something quite different. The Eventbrite Vancouver office came from the acquisition of a Vancouver startup called Picatic. That team and its leadership are still intact there, but was wrought with high turnover and toxic workplace culture for years. Here are some specific examples:

- Extremely high turnover and so many disgruntled former employees. In the last 2 years leading to the Picatic acquisition by Eventbrite, for example about 70% of the people hired to do sales, marketing, or support (the half of the company not coding full time on the core product) left in frustration or were abruptly fired. You'd never get a genuinely convincing reason why they quit or were fired, they'd never visit the office, you'd see them remove Picatic from their LinkedIn bios, you'd see them write insinuating comments around the web about it being a mediocre job, and you'd even see them leave disgruntled comments on the management team's social media posts. The origin story of the company was rarely shared because it's full of burned bridges. It was so painful.

- Not diverse, not supportive. For example, no women were hired or could be retained as employees. Many times, you would hear people's opinions be insulted out loud in front of other teams or colleagues. If an opinion wasn't the same as management's, often you would be ganged up on. Over time, everyone just started sucking up because other opinions and debate were so dangerous.

- These aren't just fixable skills, like hiring, managing, firing, defining job responsibilities, etc, but systematic problems. Also being able to say that the company was acquired (though really acqui-hired to the detriment of many people) probably only gives them validation that how they were doing things is ok, so they are unlikely to change.

- Look at roles at other offices, or just hold off 6 months and see if things and office leadership dramatically change.",,2.0,,,,,

Right after that comes that Eventbrite is a fast moving, ever evolving company. If you don't mind oreven enjoy that – and the opportunities that come with it – this is a truly exciting company to work for, and one that has a real shot at becoming the operating system of the global event industry.","The constant change can be unsettling for certain personality types. While a lot of effort is being put into it, Eventbrite is still getting to grips with acting like a truly international company.

free lunch, and some great benefits. However there is still no pension plan for UK employees.
Some good staff
Great potential if they had stronger leadership","The company is dominated by a sales culture that is driven by targets, and lead by a management team who have a blame culture. They are quick to sack staff rather than taking responsibility for their own incompetencies as managers.
The US office often make decisions on behalf of the international teams without consultation and without any knowledge of the international markets and their business needs. There is a lack of experienced leadership in the UK and a complete lack of understanding of the market they are trying to move in to. The culture has been on the decline in the last 2 years and much of the talent in the UK and US has moved on. The huge turnover of staff is something that I have never experienced before.","You need stronger leadership in the offices outside of the US. You should invest more in your staff and ensure you have experienced managers and leaders that provide support to their staff, and coach their teams to success.

2017-02-21, Business Development Manager,"London, England (UK)",Former Employee ,Past it's best,More than a year,0,"Eventbrite employs some incredibly talented people who work very hard & (used to) have a lot of fun doing it. I have seen more brand / employee loyalty and emotion attached to this place than anywhere I've worked - to me this is a sign of truly great culture. When times were good they were really good, but when they were bad.... (I'll get to this later)
You get free lunch!","Eventbrite masquerades as a ""startup"" when really they have been running for 11 years but still haven't sorted out some very basic business processes (like employing local HR, ensuring people get paid the right salary/commission, actually reaching profitability etc etc). Although Eventbrite celebrates & boasts of it's ""startup culture"" it no longer exists. In reality management want everyone to behave like they are in a big, musty old corporate machine with no diversity, no freedom / trust / autonomy, a very slow pace of change, an extremely hierarchical structure and a general ""do as I say not as I do"" attitude. This is a shame and a waste of the talent & loyalty of the staff that built and stuck with it over the last crucial 3-5 years or so. It's no wonder the last 12 months have seen a mass exodus of key staff members from all departments in every country Eventbrite operates.
This is a business that's lost it's direction and lost it's soul.","Trust and listen to your staff. You hired them, now give them the autonomy to do their jobs without micromanagement.
Take international teams more seriously. Take the time to understand them and think of them first, not last, if global expansion is truly your goal.
Care more for your employees, don't make them feel dispensable (even if you think they are it will cost you more to have to keep hiring & training new people than make the people you have feel valued).
Value diversity - cookie-cutter teams have a short shelf life and won't learn & grow from each other.

2017-02-20,,"London, England (UK)",Former Employee ,Don't believe the hype,More than 3 years,0,"Nice office in a good location
Catered lunch, as well as drinks and snacks
Some great team members","Eventbrite WAS a great place to work. There was a real buzz and people were collaborating across the business towards achieving a common goal - which was making Eventbrite a great success. It was also an environment where management/leadership were supportive and it felt like we were all in it together.

However things changed...

Understandably when a company grows it needs to get more streamlined processes, systems and become accountable - it is debatable if this has happened at Eventbrite - what is becoming clear though is that the culture has taken a dive.

Leadership appears to have taken an 'us and them' approach - lots of 'have you got a minute mate, let's grab a room/go for a walk' type chats. Minimal communication. Lots of people leaving quite quickly and quite uncertain what the long game is.

Leadership seems to neglect that employees emotionally invest in a company and work hard to make it a success. To have a leader say 'tough, there are worse places to work' when raising concerns is incredibly demotivating.

A lack of trust has also crept in, management have spoken negatively about absent employees in open spaces as well as making inappropriate comments about employees personal lives. Management has also been vocal about their political views - which is fine - however the ways and means that this has been done has left quite a few feeling uncomfortable.

Inconsistent career progression

It seems that HR are quick to respond to Glassdoor reviews however the reality is that HR on the whole were unresponsive and seemed to be more focussed on the US.","Don't just hire corporate men - there is a huge and diverse talent pool out there
As well as tech people Eventbrite also needs people who know the ticketing space

Generally hire good people (excluding management positions)
Free lunches, drinks and snacks","Recent hirings have been weighted on the corporate side, losing much of the culture which made Eventbrite a great place to work initially.
No HR in place outside the SF office, and no anonymity - if you had a grievance this would just be reported back to your manager creating a more hostile environment.
Lots of internal politics, often the person who shouts the loudest or is friends with the right person gets their way.
No career progression within UK office - no transparency or structure in place. Often promises made at interview and annual review stages which are then never acted on.
Not a transparent company despite insisting they are - really bad at communicating both at a team and company level, which creates a thriving rumour mill.","Trust your staff, stop micro-managing, clock-watching and putting processes in place for the sake of it.
Involve your full company, not just the HQ, in feedback and brainstorming sessions, and think about your other markets when creating and releasing updates - not as an after thought.
Spend more time visiting other offices to understand what is going on in them - do not just trust local management who are likely spinning the story to fit their narrative.
