2018-10-26, Mep Engineer,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Trading Prestige for Low Pay,Trading Prestige for Low Pay,0,"High Profile Projects - You can brag about your recognizable work to people and they may have heard of it.

Well-Known Company in Architectural-Engineering Consulting World - Good Resume builder

Overtime Pay for Long Hours - Straight time, not 1.5X

Decent, helpful people - Your peers are generally good, fun people who are willing to help if asked.","Low Pay, High Turnover - Arup uses it's prestige in the AEC world to justify a significantly lower base salary in the industry. Most engineers can see through this logical fallacy. Profit-share bonuses are usually a joke. 401k only vests until after 4 years, to keep people from leaving before then.

Slow Advancement/Terrible Flexibility- They only promote/raise once a year. Negotiation is rarely allowed. The compensation scheme is based on grades that are supposed to follow your advancement. In reality, this is rarely the case. On some projects I'm asked to do things well above my experience and pay grade. Who doesn't love doing the work of someone who gets paid a lot more than you? Or getting paid the same as someone who does bad work?

Lacking Transparency - The ultimate decision of whether you get a raise or not is behind closed doors. The factors of the decisions are discussed with your supervisor. In my case, my supervisor barely has an insight onto this process.

Undefined Expectations - There are no defined goals, or maybe that's just my group. I've been working here for over 2 years, and I still have no idea where I'm supposed to be in terms of skills, capability, and autonomy on projects. I can only guess where I stand among my peers. You ""turn and burn"" projects with no evaluation of the finished product. No feedback on things that could have been done better, just on to the next project with a tight deadline.

No Accountability - Nothing incentivizes you to do more work. Whether you're work is good or bad, you can expect no praise for good work or repercussions for bad work.

Culture can feel... Cult-ish - ""We shape the World"" is the motto. Loyal employees call themselves ""Arupians"" and have nothing but good things to say about our impact. The late Ove Arup is such a ""visionary"" and plastered everywhere around the office.

Yearly Appraisal System - There is a very corporate appraisal system that occurs yearly and supposedly influences your raise. Since your raise is influenced, most people will avoid negative reviews and be untruthful with there career development. Most people do not take this seriously and the conversation is extremely forced.

Bad Support - Big slow moving company. Hard to get timely support for your projects and/or from HR or IT.","- Provide review sessions on completed projects so people know if they did a good job or not.

- Make sure your engineers are not doing work excessively above their pay grade and/or have a more flexible pay scheme for those that advance to greater responsibility than others. We have lost so many good people to companies that will actually pay what they are worth.

- Provide structure for advancement so people know where they are supposed to be in terms of skills and leadership ability.

- Do away with yearly appraisals. How about quarterly or monthly less formal ""check in"" meetings? Have separate system for determining raises so employees feel they can say anything rather than lie to get a better chance at a raise.",2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0

Very little career advancement for silent and smart hard-working people.
All upper management consists of ""brought in"" British people. They selectively give leadership roles only to imported British folks. Each office has a big system in place to bring 8-10 British people over for a year or two on Long Term Assignments (LTA) and then keep them in America forever so that they can be the next bosses.
90% of the projects (In Buildings department) are new office buildings or Tenant improvement (TI) in existing buildings, so architect firms like Gensler are the ultimate client who dictate everything . Hence no job satisfaction if you are a proud engineer. The rest 10% of the projects (healthcare, datacenters etc) are done by the select few people who don't want to share their skills and experience with new people.
Entry and mid-level engineers are paid atleast 20% less than the industry standard. Arup hires lots of underpaid graduate engineers and get bulk of work done by them. This helps them pay fat salaries and business class travel expenses for the ""British rulers"". Company works on a slim profit margin thanks to extensive wasteful overheads. They take pride in the fact that they are not publicly traded, but in reality that is their biggest weakness - there are no checks on these wasteful spendings.
Only diversity exists at junior staff level. At higher up ranks, Arup is a white, male and mostly British party. There are big meetings and regular emails about ""Diversity and Inclusion"" efforts and only people talking in them are 'concerned white people'.","Stop being the British colonial machine that you are. Hire some black, brown, asian, hispanic people in top management who can really tell what ""Diversity and Inclusion"" is. Stop wasting money on stupid ""Invest in Arup"" ideas and first class travel for overpaid Arup Fellows to attend conferences half the world away that have nothing to do with ""shaping the world"".
