They really care about you,0,The benefits package was great for my family. I was pregnant and had a baby during my time at Transwest and the benefits provided through my employer were great and helped us out a lot. They were very flexible and understanding with me and made the work atmosphere very positive. I was compensated generously for the position I was in and the managers in all departments and locations were helpful and made you feel like you were family.,"There was trouble finding the perfect fit for a manager, but only because it was a new store and new location.

If you aren’t “in” with the family, know someone in the family, have been there for 30 years or are a woman, good luck progressing. The sales environment is exhausting and you won’t get any positive feedback. Be prepared to deal with back-stabbing, being thrown under the bus and tons of disappointment. If you have a thick skin and aren’t expecting any type of advancement, you might be able to make it here.

Run old school. Managers do not defend their employees.,"Reevaluate your pay structures and you will get better talent. Work on retention, and managers need to value their team they have. Work on training employees instead of letting them go so quickly. There needs to be more thought into Leadership training, Culture movement and listening to those trying to change the culture for the better or you will run into a lot of problems bringing in good talent.

2017-05-22,,,Former Employee ,"The good, the bad, the ugly","The good, the bad, the ugly",0,"Competitive pay and room for ""moving around"" within the company to gain experience in a variety of different roles, but once you have explored all the entry level operational roles, there is not much room to move upwards anymore as all the people in those roles have been with the company for years and have no plan on leaving anytime soon.

Great 401K plan including company match. You may contribute up to 6% of your paycheck and the company will match that contribution at 50%.","Poor management, poor communication between managers and staff, no structured onboarding for new hires, sub-par training for new employees - you must be willing to ask questions in order to succeed, no transparency in the company, poor PTO and no sick days (sick days come directly out of your already limited PTO) and incredibly un-flexible work hours, don't think about leaving 10 minutes early unless you use PTO or make up your 10 minutes of time later....

Benefits overall are poor - the PTO/sick time thing is a joke. I watched a lot of people struggle with not being able to take vacations because they had to use all of their PTO when they were out sick with the flu... It creates a cycle of very unpleasant morale in the office.

No ""perks"", unless someone brings in doughnuts out of the kindness of their heart there is no coffee/drinks/food provided to employees. BBQ occasionally in the summer months.

Maternity leave policy is complete BS. You have to use ALL of your PTO when you go on leave, only then can you apply for FLMA coverage where you get paid 60% of your pay for no more than 6 weeks.... so when you come back you have no remaining PTO left if your baby gets sick and if you are out more than 6 weeks, you don't get paid for it....

The entire company is run like it is still 1970 to be honest. It is a very VERY conservative, far right-wing managed and run company. Additionally, there is not a strong presence of women in upper management and along with that, an over all sense diminished respect when females try to bring ideas or solutions to the table. The overall mind-set is you are there to work, it is your priority, you are expected to be here 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, and family life comes second priority to that, or at least that is the feeling you get when you look at the benefits and amount of time off you are given.","Communicate everything, and do it better. Managers need training. Let people go that aren't working, quit hanging onto poor performers just because ""they have been with the company a long time...."" This does not encourage people to work hard or do a good job because why should they when others can perform poorly and not get in trouble for it? Do more things for employees other than a once a year event which the employees have no actual say in deciding what the event will be... Do something people will enjoy and can bond over.

Glad I didn't sell my home and move my family and every thing I owned for this one.. I was warned by the shop foreman that its a long standing joke amongst the locals how many people have been in this job.. how long was this guy going to last is what you can expect to hear when paying sales calls to customers. and sure enough.. they were right.. fortunate I moved only what I could haul back in one load. I made your store profit for the first time in for ever.. and because Basils buddy needed a job.. my employment ended. Blessing in disguise.. I couldn't run from that place fast enough.

The TransLease location in Commerce City wouldn't even spring for coffee and a coffee maker... everywhere I turned was a ridiculous level of frugality and lack of appreciation for staff.

The whole organization and its subsidiaries, of which there are many (Trans Lease, Summit Body, Transwest Buick GMC, etc). is really just a vehicle (no pun intended) to put money into the Eidsness family's pockets.

The atmosphere can be very Kindergarten or prison-like. The ""at-will employment"" contracts that you sign to be a part of Trans West are very much in effect - you're always only one mistake away from getting the boot.",Stop. Just stop.,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

2014-07-18, Outside Parts Sales (OPE),"Denver, CO",Current Employee ,"If you like heavy micromanaging, terrible leadership at the top, horrible policies and morale, than this is your place!","If you like heavy micromanaging, terrible leadership at the top, horrible policies and morale, than this is your place!",0,It's very difficult to find a pro.,"The accounting department and it's policies and way of dealing with customers costs the company untold amounts of business. Each branch location has it's own managers but they have no authority or power whatsoever. Everything must be approved by the upper management which leads to a huge disconnect between what needs to happen and what actually happens. Sales people are governed with an iron fist. Huge amounts of micromanagement and ridiculous amounts of computer work required to be done in a very specific, inefficient, and time consuming way. Management seems to care more about how you input all of your notes than what you're actually doing. Company maintains a top-down philosophy that the customers are in business for them instead of the other way around. Employees also exhibit the lowest amount of morale and loyalty that I've ever witnessed in my career. Basically, it has the worst people management and top brass that I've ever worked for. Also, the numbers that each branch are required to do are unrealistically forecasted. Branches in larger metropolitan locations have no trouble meeting and exceeding their quotas while locations in smaller markets struggle to even come close. This goes for the managers and sales people too. Sales reps from smaller markets are expected to achieve the same sales numbers as reps in large metropolitan areas, which is an exercise in frustration and futility.","The owner has stated several times that ""we're only ever one manager away from success"". The belief is that there is some magical manager who will fix everything at a branch location. Again, the trouble is that there is really only one manager who controls things over all the branches. My advice is to fire him and get a manager in there who has a spec of ability and experience with managing people. Then, let the local managers do their jobs. This goes all the way down to the sales people. You hired them to do a professional job. Let them do it without all the micromanaging. Listen to what your sales people and managers tell you about the local markets and quit pushing them to perform in ways that are not only completely unrealistic, but absolutely ridiculous as well.",2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
