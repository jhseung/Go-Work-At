2015-09-20, Valet,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,Illegal Practices & Greedy Owner,Illegal Practices & Greedy Owner,0,There are a few good things about the company. To start with the hours are extremely flexible. The managers will always be able to work around your school hours etc. The final positive is for the most part the mangers are very friendly to the valets.,"Lots of illegal practices. If the IRS was to audit this company it would be finished. To stat with the company has employees that work over 50 hours a week, every week and they keep them part time to avoid giving health insurance benefits (no one receives benefits, no matter how many hours you work.) On top of this they are able to pay below typical minimum wage because everyone is part time.

The company has a history of practice like this. It wasn't until a pre-law student passed through and sent a cease and assist that they started giving sick time.

The company will also schedule you for shifts that go until 2 am and then ask you to go to a shift at 7am. Finally if you work for them and they hire you as a valet they will often have you do jobs that aren't valet jobs. They will have you go and manage parking lots and stand around for hours doing nothing.",Start giving people who work 60 plus hours benefits and look more closely at peoples schedules and make sure the requests aren't unreasonable.,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0
