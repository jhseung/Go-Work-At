When I applied for the job, I was lied to about the position to begin with; what was posed to me as a programming position was actually glorified tech support. What turned my experience at Kaplan into an absolute nightmare was when upper management started getting more involved with the Habitat team despite the fact that they did not understand the nature of the work we did. It led to micro-managing the team and forcing us to do preferential work for their upper management “friends” rather than our responsibilities to the production side of the business. Additionally, upper management would pull us aside to attack our character — not even our performance. I was called “helpless”, “not respectable”, “unprofessional”, ""immature"", ""weak"", and had my personality and work ethic attacked without constructive criticism or even an example of I was behaving so. Oddly enough, the people that I worked with regularly (not upper management) had nothing but positive feedback for our team and the work we did for different aspects of the business. The fact that upper management, including the president of Kaplan Publishing, would take the time to personally attack our character, and then act like we were buddies in public, was enough to make me quit. It felt manipulative to have the boss openly degrade me without proof or even an example of how I was supposedly “unprofessional” or “not respectable”.

If your good at office politics you wouldn't have to work hard.,"The working environment consistently declined in my tenure. There is extremely limited opportunity for growth and they offer no training. Regardless of how hard you work your compensation is stagnant (minimal annual cost of living adjustments at best). Senior leadership does not value their employees and the employees don't trust them (most likely because they've heard so many lies). The technology and legal team is in need of a complete overhaul. The majority of the workforce is disengaged and jokes about how poor the company is run. Even managers often joke about how ""it's just how we do things at Kaplan"" .",Consider valuing your employees.
