No one micro-manages and they are great about giving the support you need to be successful.

Market - Things are really taking off. The company has doubled in size and we're planning on doubling again. I've never worked somewhere where the clients talk so highly about our products. Seriously, people love it.

Compensation - Right at the market average for tech companies in Chicago. Flexible WFH is a huge plus.

Work/Life - Some long hours here and there when deadlines are looming but not anything crazy and its not frequent enough to be a major concern.

Values - Its awesome working for an energy that practices what they preach. A ""Green Technology"" company that does a lot in terms of conservation around the office, and volunteer work outside of it.",Bandwidth - We've grown so fast that everyone is really stretched. The big hiring push should help a lot but right now its a lot of jam-packed schedules.,"Communicate long-term goals, not just short term results.
