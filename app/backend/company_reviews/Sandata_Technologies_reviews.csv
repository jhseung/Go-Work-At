2014-07-29, Administrative,"Port Washington, NY",Current Employee ,Great place to work.,Great place to work.,0,"I have worked at Sandata for a little over ten years. My experience as an employee at Sandata has overall been very positive. I strongly disagree with some of the other reviewers, particularly relating to employee recognition, advancement opportunities and management. I feel that there is opportunity for advancement within Sandata if you work hard and prove yourself. I know this is true because I experienced it firsthand when I was promoted to a position that better suited my skill set and experience a couple of years ago. I do feel that Sandata does care about its employees and that overall it offers a very pleasant work environment. Iâ€™m not sure if some of the other reviewers have worked in many other places during their careers but many of the issues they cited exist in virtually every other company out there, especially companies that have experienced the rapid growth that Sandata has over the past few years. No company is perfect. Sandata offers a stable work environment as evidenced by the fact that many of its employees have been here in excess of 15 years. That's not easy to find, especially on Long Island and especially these days. I work for a great manager who is always open to my ideas and who I feel values my input. As a working mother I find that Sandata is sensitive to family issues and very supportive of its employees as people. There is a lot of value in that aspect of the company alone. As previously stated I was surprised by the negative reviews and can only imagine that they were written by disgruntled ex-employees who may have not made the grade. And if they are written by current employees, maybe they should consider the positive aspects of working here or get another job. Work is work and the grass is not always greener on the other side.",For me the biggest con of working at Sandata is the commute which is problematic for most people who drive to work anywhere on Long Island.,"I believe that all employees in the company, regardless of their department, should receive a general training session of all of Sandata's products and services at commencement of employment. As new products or services are introduced brief training sessions should be given to all employees to familiarize them and keep them abreast of what we are doing.
Also, it would be helpful if new employees would be familiarized with the various departments within Sandata and the responsibilities of each department. This would just help with the proper flow of work within the organization.
I also think the office could use a bit of an update. New painting, carpeting and bathroom renovations would help. I believe people who feel good about their work environment bring a more positive attitude to the table.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

There are the usual 'characters' as in any company but for the most part those people are well known and people just tend to avoid them at all cost.,"The company made several key acquisitions over the past few years that greatly upgraded their portfolio. However, due to a tremendous lack of understanding of the value proposition of the accumulated intellectual properties acquired and how to make them work cohesively, they constantly make some serious missteps in implementing and distributing said products. This has also led to a major departure of key personnel from the company which in turn leads to a hoard of unhappy customers, some of which are state agencies. Work hours are outrageous. People are expected to be on-call 24/7 even if they are on vacation, at night, week-ends, etc. Customer complaints are always high and reflect a laundry list of issues with the base product as well as with outstanding issues which continue to accumulate. Legacy customers are basically ignored and new customers are generally mislead regarding system function and capabilities.","Get a realistic view of what you have in people and products, come up with a roadmap for making the stuff work and stick to it!
