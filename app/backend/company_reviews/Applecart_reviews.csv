People are incredibly smart, really driven about what they do, and are very supportive. The tech work is interesting and definitely challenging. The mission on the political end is also very rewarding.","Because it's a young company, some of the internal processes are still in formation. That means that there is a lot work to do, but this is also what makes it exciting",,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
2018-06-08,,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,"A young, fast-growing company","A young, fast-growing company",0,"- Given the size and growth of the company, you're given a high degree of ownership and autonomy.
- The political side of the company provides a strong sense of mission and accomplishment that is not present in most adtech companies.
- The work environment and culture is top notch. Everyone is friendly, hard-working and helpful.","- The engineering talent leans toward the junior end of the spectrum. Currently hiring more senior members but the current ratio means that some degree of process or architecture can be pretty green.
- The current office is overflowing. Limited call and meeting space. Moving offices in July so this should be resolved shortly.",Great job,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The company is growing rapidly but hasn't lost the feeling of being a united team. I've never felt like I was stagnating in terms of professional or personal growth, and because of the rapid growth, there's a ton of room for owning and leading different projects that really matter.","There is a lot to be done. You really have to exercise and balance that decision-making skill of what's best to do overall versus what's most important right now. The growth has been a bit of a pain point, but I wouldn't consider that a con.","The growing pains have been a bit more noticeable, but I'm glad to see that they've been addressed in a big way.

2016-12-09,,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,"Innovative, Fast Growing Start-Up","Innovative, Fast Growing Start-Up",0,"Applecart is a highly innovative start-up that is constantly finding new ways to grow and new markets to enter. The company got off the ground in 2014 and is already a profitable, bootstrapped start-up. We've found ways to embed experiments into our technology and products to make sure what we're doing is working. The company culture is well-balanced - people work hard and work long hours when they need to, but the office environment is open and relaxed with (lots of) coffee and snacks.

Some pros:
--Access to founders and team leaders. Leadership is always available and is responsive to new ideas, any problems, and concerns.
--Ability to take on lots of responsibility quickly.
--Freedom to find projects that you're most interested in.
--Flexibility and little bureaucracy.
--Interesting and exciting work with real-world impact
--Incredibly scalable product, which gives employees the feeling that they can build something from the ground up.
--Encouragement to learn new skills
--Collaborative environment within and across teams
--Incredibly smart and hard-working employees that genuinely want to help each other and share insights","Not everyone will be comfortable or thrive in a start-up environment. There isn't a ton of structure, which can be great in terms of getting things done efficiently and building new products from the ground up, but it can be difficult for people who might want more direction. Self-starters and people who are able to prioritize for themselves and start new projects from the ground up will work well here - but people who work better with more consistency/constant oversight may have a hard time.",Stay ahead of growing-pains and make sure the current products are solid before expanding. Keep listening to employees and adjust when we need to. Keep rewarding hard-working employees. Stay innovative but try not to reinvent the wheel - some best practices are best practices for a reason!,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
