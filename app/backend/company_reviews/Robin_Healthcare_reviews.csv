2019-04-27,,,Former Employee ,Great pre-med experience,Great pre-med experience,0,"Such a great environment to be in! I've worked for other scribe companies as a pre-medical student, but Robin was by far the best. I was a bit apprehensive about having to work remotely, but I definitely learned a lot more at Robin than at other in-clinic scribe companies. Although management oversees the scribes, we mostly worked independently and on our own schedule. We were free to take on as many tasks as we'd like, and opportunities to move up or engage in a new project were always there.

Some of the closest relationships I've built with physicians was at Robin as well.

You definitely get what you put in, and because this is a startup company, there are many opportunities for scribes to grow.",Having to pay for parking every day,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2019-03-18,,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,A True Austin Startup Experience,A True Austin Startup Experience,0,"-A real startup experience. Management is responsive if you come to them with ideas for the company or with skills you would like to develop. They will not tap you on the shoulder and ask if you would like a promotion, but if you tell them that you have higher aspirations and you want to expand your role, they will give you more responsibilities. You must be a self-starter to reap this benefit!!! At bigger, more established companies, you may have to work for years to be promoted, but there is a lot of room to grow here as the company is still young.
-It's a medical scribe AND a tech company, so you can grow in either direction if one interests you more
-Close proximity to campus
-Motivated coworkers who are excited about healthcare. It's a diverse group of college students, those who are in their gap year, and those who have worked at various scribe or tech companies before
-Higher pay than other scribe companies
-Monthly socials = fun team bonding","-Lack of communication on how to move up in the company, which seems to frustrate some people. This is not a con for self-starters who are not afraid to ask for more responsibilities
-The company's mission sometimes gets lost in the daily grind, so it would be great if we were all reminded of this company's mission to improve patient care!",Be open about what responsibilities are available to those who want to expand their role.,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
2019-03-11,,,Current Employee ,Robin is Permanently Disrupting the Medical Scribe Industry,Robin is Permanently Disrupting the Medical Scribe Industry,0,"I've been in the medical scribe industry for almost a decade. Robin is so different (for the better) that my experience hardly plays a role in my day-to-day. Most scribe companies are staffing firms that have created some medical scribe training. We're a bad a** tech company who happens to provide a great remote medical scribe service. I moved halfway across the country and left my old life behind for this opportunity. I haven't regretted a moment of the journey.

For scribes - We're simply offering more for our employees than any other company out there. More money? Sure. More opportunity for advancement? Early and often. Scheduling flexibility? By far the best in the industry. But that's just the beginning. Our scribes have a legitimate voice and make a legitimate impact in a rapidly growing and evolving healthcare tech company. The culture is laid back. Robin throws more money at food, drinks, and company socials/events in a month than other companies do in a year. We're also about to start offering CLINICAL ROTATIONS to our scribes as we add more specialties. That's just unheard of in the industry. With some budding partnerships and big clients on the horizon, we're just scratching the surface here.

For clients - Plug in the device and start seeing patients. That's about as complicated as it gets. This site is more for prospective employees, but it's worth pointing out just how easy it is for our providers as well.

I've never been surrounded by such a passionate, intelligent, and effective team. We just analyze problems and craft solutions differently than anyone else I've encountered. Robin truly has a chance to make a positive impact on healthcare as a whole and I feel incredibly lucky to be at the center of that effort. It's going to be a wild ride, but I'm loving every moment!","We're always looking for more and more ways to get to know each other and bond outside of work hours. Office culture can be a challenge since we all wear headphones while working. But leadership is listening to feedback and making positive changes all the time! We've started doing monthly volunteering events, LARGE monthly social events, monthly guest lecturers, etc. Many of these things are planned by scribes, for scribes. At Robin, we have a unique cultural advantage in that we have everyone under one roof instead of spread all over the place in separate clinics/hospitals. I'm really excited to see what 2019 has in store as we continue to grow as a company.","Continue to be transparent with the company/scribes. It's incredibly refreshing that everything is sort of out in the open for everyone. I feel like our SCRIBES are kept in the loop more than typical scribe company EXECS... and it just feels great. It's truly awesome that everyone knows about big company wins, additions to the leadership/engineering team, upcoming technological advances, financials, etc. Keep up the good work!",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-03-04,,"Austin, TX",Current Employee ,Unique opportunity at a fast-growing scribe company,Unique opportunity at a fast-growing scribe company,0,"Valuable healthcare experience: This is the main reason I sought out a scribing job to begin with, and it gave me a lot to talk about in med school interviews. Within my first 6 months at Robin, I was able to scribe for at least a half dozen different doctors. I don’t believe you get that kind of variety in a traditional scribing job. Robin currently only works with orthopedists for now (with plans to expand to other specialties in the next few months), and a variety of subspecialties such as hand and wrist vs sports medicine. I’ve now seen many different doctors in clinics across the country and I learn something new with each one, which is part of what keeps me interested in what I do.

Lots of opportunity for upward movement: They recently rolled out a new pay structure and outlined promotional roles and how to move up. Management is pretty transparent about the whole thing and is really honest if you ask questions. I've been promoted a few times in less than a year of working at Robin, which I also don’t believe is very common with traditional scribing jobs or really most jobs. And although most of us are pre-med and plan to go to medical school, I’ve seen some of my coworkers have opportunities to turn this job into a career. They really seem to invest in their employees and want them to succeed. Also, I saw many people listing the wage as a con, but starting pay is comparable to any other scribing job I’ve seen and is even higher than what a few of my friends make with on-campus jobs. That on top of bonuses and opportunities for promotions/raises makes me put pay in the pros section.

Flexible scheduling: I started working here when I was a student and was able to work around my class schedule easily. You’re asked for your availability up-front, so as long as you’re honest from the beginning about when you can work then there are no surprises. After graduating, I was able to get time off for last-minute interviews or even work over the weekends or get overtime when I wanted to. They have really wide hours of operation so it’s easy to get your hours in even if you’re available at weird times.

Tons of perks: Free snacks and drinks that they restock every couple of days. All of the La Croix you could ever want. They recently switched to a healthier snack vendor at the request of the employees. They also have monthly lectures from people in the healthcare field including some of the doctors we scribe for, which I think is really great because we get the chance to interact with them and ask questions. Lastly, they host monthly social events for employees and have started opening up planning discussions to everyone and having polls for which event to pick. It feels very inclusive and I can tell they’ve been trying to further develop the company culture.","Parking: If you don’t live in west campus and have to commute, parking can be a bit of a pain. The garage next door is expensive and street parking can be hard to find. However, they’ve been really receptive to parking feedback and have recently started reimbursing employees for 50% of parking costs through an easy-to-use app. If you live in west campus, you can easily walk to work.","With the recent changes, it’s obvious that the people who work here have a voice and that management is listening. Keep being receptive to feedback and keep making changes for the better!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Long hours are a con and so is a COMPLETELY UNPAID TRAINING PROCESS that you have no guarantee of getting through. If you do decide you want to make a maximum of $9.50 an hour working ~35 hour work weeks doing work that should really be done by people far more qualified, and you want to neglect your school work this might just be the workplace for you!","Spend your time worrying about things that actually matter like your employees coming into work and getting nothing done, hiring decent people, and finally perhaps management should do something about the NUMEROUS HIPAA VIOLATIONS THAT OCCUR IN THE OFFICE DAILY.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
2019-02-09, Medical Scribe,"Berkeley, CA",Former Employee ,Wonderful work environment that will undoubtedly be a lasting influence on my future medical career,Wonderful work environment that will undoubtedly be a lasting influence on my future medical career,0,"During my time at Robin Healthcare, I was given a lot of autonomy with respect to the work I wanted to do and felt that I was truly part of a team. Management was very open with every aspect of the company's inner workings, and open to feedback, solutions, and suggestions for improvement from employees at every level.

I am currently a first year medical student, and Robin Healthcare was a great talking point in all of my medical school interviews. After leaving Robin, I started a research project with a physician who uses the company's services whom I met while working there.

The biggest pro that Robin has to offer to individuals looking to enter the health professions is the breadth and depth of exposure to medicine. I was able to learn so much about patient care through observing patients, physicians, physicians assistants, and nurse practitioners. I also learned an enormous amount about the musculoskeletal system in a short amount of time, making the musculoskeletal curriculum in the first year of medical school a breeze.",This is a non-traditional medical scribe position in the sense that you are not physically in clinic with physicians and patients.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-02-09, Medical Scribe,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Great Pre-Med Experience,Great Pre-Med Experience,0,"Robin is located in West Campus which is very conventient for UT students. Although 20 hours is the minimum requrired for part time, they work around your class schedule to make sure that you can make it work.
You gain so much medical knowledge from working here. You get to scribe for many different physicians in many different specialties without having to physically follow the physicans around all day. You start off as a scribe but there's also room to move up the ladder.
The managers are easy to talk to. If I ever had a concern, I had no issue talking to any of them. They're very understanding about giving time off for exams or other academic related reasons.","Sometimes there is a communication gap between the scribes and the senior management. We didn't always understand why some decisons are made the way they were, but you can always talk to them about it and they're more than willing to clear up any confusion.
Parking is expensive if youre parking in the garage or having to street park every day.
There is a learning curve, so if you have a very busy class schedule, it may seem tough in the beginning. BUT it becomes much easier to balance everything out after a few weeks.",Talk to the scribes who work for that specific physician before making a decision about that team.

2019-02-09, Quality Assurance Manager,"Berkeley, CA",Current Employee ,"Great scribing experience at a fun, growing company with a vision!","Great scribing experience at a fun, growing company with a vision!",0,"I really enjoyed my time working for Robin, and as an added benefit, I developed priceless clinical knowledge that has given me a huge leg up in my first year of medical school.

I found Robin to be a company with true personality. Company culture matters to them and it showed--whether it's supplementary educational seminars, going out for happy hour with co-workers, or dogs in the office, it was a fun and well-rounded environment. They abide by the work-hard, play-hard attitude and provide plenty of opportunities for both!

The management definitely appreciates hard-workers and initiative. I always felt heard and had the opportunity to take on bigger roles and more responsibility over time. They consistently embraced my (and my co-worker's) suggestions for improvement and seemed to genuinely care about improving the scribing experience. The company as a whole encourages feedback and is very responsive.

Perhaps the most rewarding part of working at Robin was getting to see the true positive change we were making in the doctors' lives. I still remember when one of the new doctors we worked with boasted that Robin was improving his interactions with patients, saving him hours each day, and giving him more time to spend with his newborn daughter! :) It's moments like those that made the work feel so worth it.","Not much! I worked hard when I was there, but I found the work to be rewarding and rewarded!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,
2019-02-20, Medical Scribe,"Austin, TX",Former Employee ,Robin Healthcare is an opportunity to be part of the change in healthcare.,Robin Healthcare is an opportunity to be part of the change in healthcare.,0,"Experience: Above everything, I am continuously thankful for the opportunity to have gained so much experience in my time at Robin. I've always said that I have been able to learn more about the practice of medicine through my time at this job than in my four years of undergrad. Additionally, this is more than just passive shadowing. I actively learn to see and understand what the doctor is doing, and it is such a practical skill. I've been able to write and talk about it in all of my essays, resumes, etc. for medical school.

Culture: Robin also has a really big focus on creating a healthy and happy community. I've seen it go from a group of like 5 of us to a whole building of 100 of us, and still management has continuously tried their best to keep everyone connected. Even on hard days, my team constantly motivated me to want to try my best. They do what they can as a startup to provide us with opportunities for socials, free lunches, snacks, etc. I genuinely felt like my peers and ever managers cared for me.

Pay: I'm going to start off and say, yes the pay is not actually that competitive compared to other nearby jobs. Most college students live a luxury of working on campus where the jobs start at a minimum of $10 and you're only required to work 5-10 hours a week. These same students come into Robin expecting these same luxuries, but Robin is a real company and a real job with very real responsibilities. Sure, they don't pay as much as a campus job might, but compared to other scribing companies they're very competitive. Additionally, they make up for it by constantly having opportunities for bonuses, providing flexible schedules, and keeping employees well fed and happy. If you come in expecting Robin to be a typical college job, then of course you're going to complain about the 20 hours a week, but this is what it is like in the real world that I believe many of my less satisfied coworkers failed to remember. And circling back to my first point - the experience you get through this career is priceless.","Communication: There were many times that changes were made without informing people why, leaving scribes to feel like they are not being cared for or heard, after all, we are all a team and want to know what is happening. There are also so many levels of administration, it is hard to know who to always ask for what. Speaking of which, any scribe has the opportunity to also progress further in the company, but sometimes the rules of how to do so were not always clear. Basically, there is always something happening and it can be hard to keep up. Sometimes half the people will know something that the others don't, or a decision will be made regarding your position without first addressing you, etc.

Expectations: I also had a slight issue with Robin remembering their audience. Half their employees are full time students and only part time workers, yet there were times where I felt I was being asked to prioritize my job over studying. Of course they do try their best to be as flexible as they can, but being a full time student also comes with things you can't always schedule in, like exams, office hours, group projects, etc. and I felt I was asked to have to work those around my shift rather than the other way around. I recognize that I did knowingly sign up for this job and knew the time commitment and so forth, but I do think there needs to be more of a compromise because Robin should know most of their workers are going to want to prioritize school and classes, as they should. Sometimes I was able to take off a few hours to study and make up those hours later, but other times I was not. More consistency in how to handle this would be appreciated.","As the company gets bigger and bigger, keep up the work getting to know everyone personally. Being a scribe, sometimes it gets to feel like it's a numbers game - like how many notes do I need to complete, how much time does each note take, etc. And from a business standpoint, I get it. But I also know that no one likes feeling like they are just another number or another employee or just another statistic. People like to feel like they are people, not a note outputting machine. So just remember to keep talking to your employees, make them feel heard, and try to empathize with them - after all, they almost all want to be doctors one day, so empathy is part of their language.",4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Robin has been accommodating with scheduling and balancing busy lives with work. They are invested in making the company great, and it is nice to know that we are making a difference in the providers’ lives by lessening their burden!

Robin has monthly events and socials, and is starting to involve all employees in the planning process. It is nice to have a voice and really make the events fun for everyone. I genuinely enjoy hanging out with all my co-workers, and have made many friends in my time with Robin.

Robin also provides snacks, drinks, and caters lunch for everyone regularly. They are working on offering healthy snacks that are super easy to grab! The office is also really close to some great restaurants, so there is always good food nearby!

Having served my time as an in-person scribe, I appreciate the opportunity to work at my own pace, take breaks when necessary, and escape the stressful world of chasing after a doctor while dragging a computer behind you. There are also ample opportunities to move up in the company, and the job is really as good as you make it!

Overall, Robin is rapidly growing and constantly trying to improve. It is really cool to see the progress that has been made since I started working here, and I am really excited to see where it goes in the future!","Right now, most of the focus for scribing has been on orthopedics, which I am not personally interested in pursuing in my career. However, there are upcoming opportunities to scribe for new specialties, which I am very excited to see.

Communication between all levels of management and employees could be better, but as a start-up they are still learning and constantly trying to improve. Robin seems to be very invested in listening to and implementing feedback from all levels.

Since I commute daily to work and don't live downtown, the office location could be better for me. Since many employees are students, it is very conveniently located on West Campus, but kind of a pain to get to with Austin traffic if you don't live within 3-4 blocks. Parking is also expensive and kind of a pain, but Robin is starting to partially pay for parking costs, which personally makes my situation less of a hassle.

There is also a bit of a learning curve moving from in-person scribing to virtual, or starting fresh. It seems like the training process has drastically improved since I started, and there are always people in the office to answer questions and help you learn. Once you get the hang of the material and application use, there is no where to go but up!","Communication is the most important thing with a growing company. There is always room for improvement, and it is vital that everyone is on the same page with major decisions and changes.
