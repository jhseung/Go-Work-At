Don't come into every 1:1 expecting an explanation of the team they are managing (for over a year).

In my time there, I was one of six people who reported harassment to their managers where no action was taken. It is accepted and practiced along with victim blaming and gaslighting.

- Great food options
- Great accommodation for work environment (switching offices, WFH, remote)

Adobe is truly a great company to work for and it shows within the people that you work with. Everyone I've met is incredibly open and my experience so far has been great when it comes to being able to chat with any individual within the company that I am interested in learning from.

I started off as an intern last summer and was able to return as a full-time employee and it has been great. The company really pushes for work-life balance and to work smarter than work harder. Upper management within my organization is really open to accommodating to talk to, although I know that one's experience in regards to that can vary based on your org. I'm super excited to be starting my professional career at Adobe and look forward to how my career will develop at this company.","Food isn't free, but it is subsidized and definitely worth what you're paying for. If it ever becomes free, that would be great!

Also based on what I've heard from fellow interns, there is a lot of ambiguity in regards to intern to full-time conversion and I hope that experience would be more defined as I had a lot of my peers experience a limbo of being recommended to have the opportunity to return as a full-time employee but end up not receiving any offer.

Can be a pro for some, but there is definitely a strong WFH culture and so the office can feel rather empty. Regardless, work gets done which is fine.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-02-10,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Isolation and Offshoring,More than 3 years,0,"Nice office with lots of artwork, generous IT facilities (2 docking stations), food, snacks, cafeteria, generous benefits for BART, Caltrain, and other health / wellness benefits.","Two things were very tough to endure at Adobe: 1. Isolation, 2. Offshoring.

Isolation

Regarding isolation, this applied to me and my ""coworkers"", but I think others at Adobe were well-integrated with a team. So my experience in the group I worked in could have been unique. But small teams and geographically-distributed teams are subject to LOTS of isolation. In the 3+ years I worked there, I worked in three different physical office buildings, and moved my desk four times. I worked for four different bosses in three remote locations. Most of all, the people I worked with on a day-to-day basis were also geographically dispersed, and, with me moving around a lot, and other people sitting around me moving around, I never felt a sense of community. The people in the desks near me were not on my team and I didn't work with them. Often they were a bit stuck-up, or unfriendly, or from a sales culture that emphasized a ""dressy business casual"" attire for some reason, which was at odds with my more casual garb (despite the fact they were not customer-facing). Moreover, they had little interest in technical subjects, and therefore encounters were often awkward. I always felt under-dressed, but I had no reason to dress up in my role.

Our group had lots of turnover, so there were constantly new and/or different individuals I worked with. I therefore felt physically isolated, and, a bit psychologically isolated because our team was relatively small and not well-known within Adobe and with customers.

Lastly, there was no good reason given for why I was moved around so much. I almost felt it was at the whims of facilities and/or management.

Offshoring

Adobe uses offshoring aggressively for certain teams and I'm not sure why. It didn't work in my department. Resources in India were poorly trained (if at all), stuck in their ways, very bureaucratic, and under the tight control of another managerial organization, so they had little, if any, incentive to work together or get ideas/insight from their counterparts in North America. Most importantly, I found most of my working time spent fixing or redoing a lot of work that was of poor quality that was previously performed by offshore resources. Offshore teams went through significant turnover, but were still firmly in place, even in positions of authority when I left, with a regular set of newcomers to replace people that had resigned or moved to another department. Offshore teams were often extremely slow and error-prone in their work, and often made very bad decisions about processes and tools that had very negative consequences.

Conclusion

Adobe has lots of great people and products. Unfortunately, in my case, my team at Adobe suffered from much political ""power trips"", isolation, hierarchical, and top-down approaches, and ""upper level"" teams with ""carte blanche"". These people are self-proclaimed experts that will look down at you, always find fault with your work, give no thanks for the hard work and struggles that you do, and generally try hard to bully and make life miserable for you, simply because you are ""below"" them.

Be careful working at this company. It's a big company, so others' experiences could be more positive. But mine and others were not so pleasant. If you work with offshore teams or in a small or little-known group/department, watch out. The fancy buildings, fancy food, and benefits are nice, but when you are isolated and not respected for your work, that negates all the good things at Adobe.",Seriously evaluate if offshoring is a good idea for certain teams. Don't just shuttle people from desk to desk and from office to office for no good reason.,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0

They tend to keep people siloed doing one particular function, and do not really promote expanding your skillset.

Adobe provides a decent but not consistent approach to work/life balance as it really varies from team to team and from org to org.","Adobe San Jose HQ is becoming an increasingly political, ethnically homogeneous and hierarchical environment where nepotism and favoritism thrives. Adobe tolerates brilliant jerks, it even celebrates them. Adobe lacks diversity in engineering and especially in management ranks. Some teams do not respect open vacation policy. Culture is inconsistent across organizations and teams. Some non-native engineering managers mock diversity and even discourage it by saying it will be harder for someone from a different ethnic background to hit the ground running and quickly assimilate with the rest of the team hence resulting in homogeneous engineering teams. Other engineering managers from foreign countries also claim that the true diversity they care about and seek in their teams is the diversity from within their own native (foreign) country, explaining that they have plenty of ethnic groups and languages there too. This approach to 'diversifying' enforced by some foreign engineering managers at Adobe has resulted in homogeneous engineering teams where everyone thinks along the same lines resulting in less innovation.","Not long ago, Adobe was an exceptional place to work and it is not too late to save it.

For employees, the company has been doing extremely well with their Cloud offerings so the stock has nearly tripled in price in less than 3 years making a great ROI for employees that get RSUs. Pay is good/ average compared to other companies in the area.

Lastly, it's a great place to be if you're looking for flexibility and WFH opportunities. As long as you're doing your job and in the office for key in person meetings, they don't care where you work from.","If you are motivated and career driven, this is not the place for you. There is no CLEAR path to promotions. Most of the management/ Director positions are filled with external candidates and it is extremely difficult to move up unless you have an executive sponsor. Also, they don't conduct formal performance reviews which could be part of the problem.

Adobe often times prides itself in being one of the BEST places to work but HR works hard on these surveys and they are always asking employees to rate them well.

He even had a dozen years corporate experience with fortune 50 companies.

He apparently was amicable, diplomatic and passionate about joining Adobe and even had a creative background on top of his MBA. But because he didn’t quite fit the ‘profile’ he didn’t get it. Even when the majority of the interview team thought he was the one, but no.

This is the type of hiring discrimination that stays in the shadows. The Adobe of yesteryear would’ve taken him and his passion.

2017-07-04, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Incredible place to be.,More than a year,0,"- Adobe invests in retaining top talent. Experts land here, and then are incentivized heavily to stay. Thus, if you're fortunate enough to be a junior engineer on a team, chances are good that you'll be surrounded by the very best in the industry to help mentor you. I've found my team to be humble, mature, accomplished, and eager to help me improve my skills.

- Because the engineers here are very much at the top of their game, it makes for a very uncompetitive atmosphere - they have little to prove and are very secure with their abilities. As a result, I've found the teams to be incredibly productive and collaborative.

- Adobe has a thoughtful business strategy. It is stable, focused, and driven. It doesn't get swept up in the typical flashy and silly hype surrounding much of the tech industry. It's fun to be part of this larger, sensible vision.

- I came here because the company placed a high value on ethics. Since I've been here, I've seen that these ethical standards are robust, and it makes for an awesome work environment.

- This is one of the few top tech companies that truly wants you to have a good work-life balance. Adobe understands that their employees perform better when they're not burnt out. Adobe understands that it's better to retain top talent and reduce churn than it is to constantly lose key team members and have to get new employees up to speed. This seems like a no-brainer strategy, but if you look at the industry retention rates, you'll see that few companies understand this.

- It's not a cult. I've not had anyone try to feed me kool aid. I really appreciate this, and probably would have gone elsewhere if this weren't the case. Even though I have a high opinion of the company, I've not ever really expressed this at work - it's simply not part of the culture to bleed for the brand or put on a show about how much you love the company.",- I wish its brand were as sexy as some other tech companies.,"- Keep on keeping on, and so will I.

2017-03-28, Seasoned Sales Associate,"Lehi, UT",Current Employee ,What once was a dream is now a nightmare,More than 5 years,0,"Adobe is a dream and has so many wonderful things to offer. It does however have a single festering sliver that NEEDS to be pulled. Among the many pros of working at Adobe here are a few: elite/driven people, amazing products, fast innovation, positive global impact, and benefits that cant be beat. At one time there was endless growth possibilities.. that was until the sliver got there.","About two years ago leadership changes were made and a marketer was hired to run the Inside Sales Team. He openly admits that his only sales position throughout his career was a total failure. He claims to be data driven and relies heavily on his data guy. Both guys think the entire company can be driven on data alone, and not real world logic. That is basically the demise of everything that has happened since they both started. To his own detriment he has frequently ignored line management who know better. Every time there is push-back from line management it is likely ignored or those individuals are singled out and caught in his cross-hairs. Its very unfortunate because the managers are only making suggestions to better the company and strengthen the team.

They have cut territories, increased quotas, and hired a large staff of analysts to police the quality of work being done. This staff is being paid nearly a million dollars total per year to micro manage. Pipeline is starting to dwindle because of the lack of production due to unnecessary babysitting.

Morale has never been lower...","Pull the festering sliver! A management change is much needed for the Inside Sales Team, otherwise they will continue to experience high attrition. They need to be replaced with seasoned sales professionals who welcome team collaboration and unity. If Adobe is looking to save money it needs to reconsider the wasteful spending on this analyst team and remove it entirely. Lets Make Adobe Great Again!",3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0
2017-03-30, Inside Sales,"Lehi, UT",Current Employee ,Inside sales- circling the drain,More than 3 years,0,"Good benefits, fountain coke AND pepsi machines, pearl ice, waterless urinals, free sunglasses, completely sealed gaps in bathroom stalls, natural landscaping, goats, a nice perch to look down on all the point product companies below.","Well.... if you are still reading this you must either be very bored and lonely, a recruiter (seriously guys... you are at a 9 with the Linkedin emails and I need you at a 4), a disgruntled previous employee making sure the grass didn't green back up...(pst... it didn't), perhaps a ""sales"" leader looking for a real opinion...

Or maybe you are a prospective new employee, eager to start your sales career and are looking to base a major career decision on a random, anonymous, TOTALLY unbiased online source (seriously millennials, don't talk to internet strangers). I direct my comments to you though (please take as many grains of salt as your parent's insurance-provided-doctor prescribes).

You'll notice the other reviewers' chief complaint is with our Sr. dictat... I mean director... to summarize, he has no successful previous sales experience, has insulated himself with a thick layer of mid-level management, armed himself with a fleet of analysts, doesn't listen to any of his more experienced line managers, and targets people who challenge him then warns others to not ask ""career limiting questions."" He tries to come across as genuine but is basically a male version of Dolores Umbridge.

So how does a marketer take control of an inside sales organization?

The key is to remember that most of the roles in this org involve finding prospective buyers and setting up demos for our sales team. There are a few roles where you work with an AE to close small deals but these are difficult to work your way into and frankly the juice isn't really worth the squeeze once you make it into that. So more than likely you aren't in ""Sales"" (from Adobe's perspective). Sure -- you are developing valuable skills for your future as a sales professional, and many very successful salespeople cut their teeth in this org, but from Adobe's perspective you are a lead generator (not unlike a marketing email, display ad, paid search term, etc). Ultimately, a cost of sales -- and costs are meant to be lowered -- which is exactly what the Sr. Director spends most his time on.

That's how a marketer takes over an inside sales org. Because somebody who spends more time with spreadsheets then people thought they could lower cost of sales and manage people like a marketing campaign- while simultaneously preparing them for sales careers.

Hopefully Adobe wises up, replaces top leadership with actual sales professionals who can groom the next generation, and stop the hemorrhaging of great sales talent leaving in droves.

That being said, maybe you will be the transfusion to replace the lost life blood of inside sales... About 15 spots have opened up and there are a lot more coming soon (like empty first class rooms on the sinking Titanic). Just go in with your eyes open, get Adobe on your resume and then have an exit strategy.

Most of the mid-level management privately express concerns about how intensely we've hired in India, how they are blocked from hiring elsewhere, how challenging it is to find staff with a mindset of attention to detail, quality work, and an understanding of how to communicate internationally. They are generally afraid to communicate this to executives. Key executive positions are held by talented Indian leaders who do not appear to understand the extent of these cultural difficulties in hiring at an individual contributor level. Back office and IT are largely a mess because UX focus has been customer-centric for so long, and many small development mistakes have been introduced into systems. Leadership and hiring there could be improved as the complexity of the environment increases.","Most groups need tools and ideas to better manage the volume of meetings and emails consuming people's time. Open work environment increases collaboration and team bonding, in some cases, but reduces productivity as people find it difficult to maintain flow, or abandon their cubicles to find quiet spaces and less movement, despite a desire to work near their teams.","Help your employees get more effective work done. Fix the back office employee experience and systems through better tools, automation, ideas, and/or hiring. And reduce the amount of inexpensive manual labor you are throwing at the problem long term. Large, complex challenges can usually be fixed through intelligent collaboration, clever ideas, targeted and better hiring in leadership. Develop, research, or better disseminate the correct best practices. Where system complexity is high, temporarily spend the time/effort getting leadership (or heaven forbid consulting) in the top 1% in these key areas, rather than the top quarter. Further develop processes and culture that allow the best ideas to pass through the environment rather than layers of leadership.",4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0

Comp package, benefits, employee stock plan and the #AdobeLife is elite. ""I Don't Like it, I Love It,"" by Flo Rida and Robin Thicke wrote this jam about Adobe.","Only one problem: Inside Sales leadership. There are no leaders in management, though they have the titles, they cannot do their jobs because their leader appears to be dishonest, condesending and threatened his entire org during the most recent all-hands meeting, to not ask “career limiting questions,” regarding their quotas going up 40% to 125%. Any managers that challenge his ideas are pushed out. His pride is killing Inside Sales at Adobe.

Employees aren't heard, valued or respected. Twelve (12) from Inside Sales have left in the past month, but whats scarier is the amount of people actively looking. When it==the max exodus occurs they won’t care, but they won’t even see if coming because they think all is well in Zion. There are many more that will be gone by the Summer. Our leadership actually reached out to another local company that hired some of the Adobe employees, and demanded that company end existing interviews with all Adobe employees. The evdence is the emails that company sent to the interviewing Adobe employees. HR violation or not, that’s how this leadership behaves. They don’t listen and they think they can solve problems, but with no sales leaders in upper management they often misdiagnose the problem and the solutions just compound problems. This is not just a Lehi problem as two from San Jose left in the last two weeks. Our leadership will handpick specific people and situations and use that best case scenario as the typical example of how things should work every single time.

Leadership has raised quota 4 times mid-year in the last 22 months. Once you hit your number, they move the number back then brag about how they removed the cap that the last leader had. We miss that guy. After one such quota change they retroactively took money from an entire team of ADMs, totaling thousands per ADM. Retroactive folks! He has taken away entire revenue streams, not paid out spiffs, forced ADMs to compete against the field team and doesn’t provide cover over the top when we attempt to execute his plan against our field teams. We have “new quality standards” that are simply just busy work for him to report up some awesome new changes. All of this would be fine if we were being compensated properly to deal with his drama, but production has fallen off a cliff and he bragged that gives him more credibility as a leader. He may be delusional, narcissistic or just threatened by A+ players. I will admit, I’m not a doctor. I have heard comparisons to Lord Farquad, but I have not seen the movie Shrek, so I cannot comment. During our company Christmas party one of the white elephant gifts was rolls of toilet paper with his likeness custom printed on the ultrasoft. Many fought over that gift. During one exit interview he was called out on his threat to the org regarding “career limiting questions” and he denied ever making that comment. He forgot its recrded and that it was attended by nearly 150 people. It’s also cute that he personally posted a positive review of the great job he’s doing here at Adobe, lol. Now he has the other Inside Sales managers posting positive reviews on Glassdoor. Now you know you’re desperate…","Focus on us and not the field sales team. Fix our org problems. Every new change is for the field and not your own org (TBP, Value Prompter, Auditor team). Just save face and fix our problems. We don’t need or want an apology because we don’t value public perception over production. With your Director title, you are accountable to fix it. No one is right all the time and we don’t hold it against you until you start lying and talking to us like we’re children. Don’t tell us that it’s a good thing that our quota doubled and then tell us we’re being recognized as a high performer when you give us a 20% quota raise tax on top of everyone else on our team. Stop using your fake smile. Its offensive when you smile like that as you end our careers at Adobe and then stop us from trying to leave on good terms. This is Ground Hog Day and Friday the 13th mixed together because when I finally die and the pain and horror is over, its starts all over again the very next day.

I have been with the organization for over two years now and have seen a lot of talented people leave because of their lack of faith in his leadership abilities and organizational direction.

Over the last year I have seen a complete turnaround in the organization and Moral across the sales team.

Additionally, if you are a performer, the workload will just pile on to that individual.

*Extremely High functioning employees are eventually rewarded recognized
*Perk pushes like working from home
*Environmentally conscious
*Community outreach and support
*Advancement potential (though dependent on department)","Little to no racial diversity particularly at the Sr. Level and an odd new ""TechBro"" culture in some departments.
Middle level managers are often promoted into positions they are ill prepared for managing (see below).
Certain operational departments thrive in nepotism and team members are recruited from fraternal connections regardless actual experience or capabilities (tech-broism)
Sr Mangers/Director level managers are unapproachable and seem uninterested in the individuals on the teams that report up to them.
HR (though that is no longer their name) should provide the example of how to treat employees, they seem uninterested in employee satisfaction. Any relevant analytics to be gleaned from the review process is just ""data"" to them. Therefore promotions are long overdue, often title/grade levels are inaccurately applied when compared to other companies within the same industry.","Hold Directors and Sr Directors accountable for the actions of the Sr. Manager and managers reporting to them. Listen to staff, they are the experts in what they are doing and in the grind of it day in and day out, their insight is invaluable when time for input/analysis.

The company is mostly run by white males who give lip service to diversity but have zero interest in it. There is a huge amount of narcissism and a bias towards people who talk nonstop about how great the company is and brown nose. It's like the worst frat you've ever seen. Most salespeople have never used the products they are selling. They have their sales scripts but that's it.

You are expected to attend meetings and engage in typical workaholic behaviors if you want to go anywhere or save your job. They literally openly threaten firing during conferences and meetings if you do not praticipate to their liking. I have spoken to a number of people who have missed family events years in a row or missed milestones like their child walking for the first time because they are expected to attend grueling meetings regardless. It is very clear that these people must give total control of their homelife to their spouse or partner, otherwise their home would be in shambles.

Expect poor to no training or mentorship. When you struggle, you will be blamed. You'll be pointed to the web with countless trainings that will teach you zero valuable skills. Your mentor will end up being someone who is way too busy trying to be a superstar suck up to actually mentor you. When you fail you'll be labeled as ""just not adobe material.""

The processes are a bureaucratic nightmare that would make George Orwell say ""really? That seems over the top."" Expect that any process will require you to call or interact with offshore resources in India who struggle to communicate and have zero understanding of the process beyond their link in the chain.

It is without question the least empathic work environment I have ever seen. God forbid you bring up anything unpleasant like a death in the family or anything similar as just small talk. The employee will gloss over it and talk about how ""excited"" they are about the ""opportunities"" Adobe has in the market. That is unless they want to sell you something and then they will act like they care until the deal is done.","Stop talking about things and actually do them. Get the female population above 20%. That's a shameful number for a company that is in this market.

Actually focus on work-life balance rather than paying it lip services (""I know you'll need to miss your moms funeral, but..."").

2015-05-08, Enterprise Account Executive,"Salt Lake City, UT",Current Employee ,Sales at Adobe,More than 5 years,0,"Great overall environment at the office in Lehi, Utah. Benefits are amazing at Adobe and the open work space provides for lots of interaction with colleagues. The ameneties in the building are second to none!

Adobe is admired in Utah.","The downside is that the sales compensation model is constantly changing from year to year. After each change, it is more difficult for Account Executives to make money (it is difficult to make good money at Adobe now days, great money is a thing of the past). Multiple AE's brought in large deals last year, and the year before, so Adobe officially capped them and did not pay commission above a certain amount (of course this message from management was delivered to the AE's after they sold the large contracts, happy selling!).

Quotas at Adobe are usually 3 to 4 times higher than the average AE's quota at a competitor or other software company. Quotas have increased by 40%+ each year over the past 3 years. Additionally, upper sales management is choosing to micro-manage and apply pressure to bring deals forward (that aren't ready) as pressure mounts to perform on Wall Street. Have you ever had a manager tell you to bring a deal forward that isn't ready? It's not fun and it sets you up for failure even though management knows that the deal isn't ready.

I've never seen it this bad at Adobe. Pressure to perform is mounting and the crap will keep rolling down hill as quotas aren't obtained...","Keep the great benefits! The atmosphere use to be amazing, it has slowly changed over the years but can be turned around with the right changes. Remember that AE's perform best when properly motivated by money and environment. Unfortunately, both of those are slowly being done away with under current management. It appears that we are going the way of SAP as the pressure to perform mounts.

Overall, I love Adobe and hope that managment makes changes quickly to the sales compensation model and the large quota's that are given Account Executives. If changes are made too late, I am afraid that AE's are going to start leaving in large chunks similar to last year, especially since Adobe under pays for sales talent in Utah.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
