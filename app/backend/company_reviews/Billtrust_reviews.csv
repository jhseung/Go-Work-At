As for charge backs that is common in any sales organization. For marketing the changes that were made over the last 18 months have made a huge difference in the business.

Being an SDR at Billtrust was a great experience to build a solid foundation to learn about researching industries, businesses, and cold calling/emailing prospects. They provided paid training at their headquarters in NJ to learn all about the company and their software/products - by the end of it, I couldn't believe what a great collaborative culture exists at this company. At first, I wasn't sure how the job would start out, but the SDR managers and my team members gave me all the tools and resources to learn from their experiences so I could put rubber to the road and be successful from the start. In a short time, I developed a great system to learn about all the businesses in my territory, find the contacts who I needed to speak with, and call/email them. In less than 1 year, the SDR role set me up for success to move up in the sales organization with confidence to work with customers and sell, and I made a great base salary and nice commission in the process. The SDR role at Billtrust is a great place to learn about software sales from very friendly and collaborative team members because of it's awesome culture, and build a great career at a company that's only growing because of it's great technology their customers love.

For anyone looking for a quota carrying software sales jobs, it's almost impossible to get your foot in the door without industry experience. This type of role is becoming more and more popular among SaaS companies and it's because a good ADR/SDR team does a ton to generate more business. After interviewing with several members of the sales leadership team, it felt like a good fit for me and I accepted the offer to come on board. Almost a year later, I couldn't be happier with my decision. The culture difference between Billtrust and spending years within the staffing/recruiting industry is day and night. There's a ton to learn and it takes time to understand the products, industry, and our customers. There's a lot of support from both managers and your peers to help you get comfortable and confident with your outreach and strategy. The job is heavily focused on reaching out to prospects and starting a sales cycle with the account executive team. The sales team in Chicago/West Chicago is still pretty small so you're definitely not just a number. If you are looking for a good work life balance, you'll find that here. This is a sales role so there's always going to be some pressure and stress that comes with the job, but compared to environments I've been in and knowing what other companies s are like, this is a great place to work. Most people don't want to be an ADR/SDR for life, and I've been fortunate enough to get promoted into an Account Executive role where I can focus more on closing business. So to summarize this rather long review, here's what you need to know.... A) great culture and work life balance B) exciting market to be in that's constantly changing C) we sell good products that honest people can stand behind D) opportunity for growth.",This is very much a sales job so you have to be able to manage your time well and work hard. Our products can be very complicated from an IT perspective. You don't have to be an expert at it to be successful as an ADR/SDR but you need to be able to learn quickly and make an effort to be educating yourself. I knew nothing about financial technology or accounts receivable automation before Billtrust and still had success. The biggest competitor in many cases is the status quo. Some of the people you're reaching out to aren't receptive to change and it takes time to build trust with them in order to get them to agree to a meeting with you. You also have to be able to adapt to frequent change.,"Flint is a very hands on CEO and makes the effort to be accessible to everyone in the company.

It is also good to work for a company that has a product that provides a solution to an increasing problem in the industry. There is a long term need for the kind of software we provide.

For folks that work in positions with coverage and/or non-essential positions you have the freedom to use the unlimited PTO that they offer. Single person healthcare coverage is free of charge.

Pay is ok, but not great.","Billtrust seems to like to build itself around single points of failure. Multiple positions in the company have massive amounts of knowledge held by one or two people with little concern as to what happens when those people leave.

For example, the entire company-wide IVR process is managed by one guy.

One of the business units for the company consists of only 2 customer support guys and less than 5 developers.

The primary and largest business unit has massive technical debt and when stakeholders bring it up everyone seems to shrug and treat it as a non-issue. When massive system outages occur everyone is on deck to fix it but then it seems to be forgotten and it tends to get swept under a rug.

While there are currently no shortage of open projects, management seems to delay constantly to acquire new resources while team members leave and management pushes project timeline metrics to tighter and tighter deadlines.

Some seem to abuse the open PTO policy and appear to constantly be out of the office or on vacation every month, leading to persistent pressure on other team members with little or no repercussions.

Long term, the company appears to have no strategic vision for how to make the company better. Beyond seeking investment funds and acquiring new entities, there appears to be no long-term plan to improve system performance, stability and produce consistent timelines for work that needs to be performed.

Based on this, my assumption is that executive management is staging for a sale to a much larger entity some time down the road.","Focus on technical debt. Pull the skeletons out of the closet and work to improve system performance and stability and modernize the system.

Work to cross train team members with deep knowledge with those that do not to improve redundancy and erase single points of failure.

It may sound crazy, but I'd consider a regular PTO system to prevent abuse (not unlimited).

Invest in more analytics to accurately estimate things such as project delivery times, employee hiring, and areas that need focus.

People have respect for your personal life, and the PTO, depending on who your manager is, can be fairly generous","I am saying the following to help you make a decision here, it is not because I am angry. Keep in mind that things change, but consider the following:

There are many people who do almost nothing for the company. They look good because others around them have to pick up the slack. The passive survive and are even praised for their mediocrity while the passionate are treated like they are a problem. Are they overly passionate? No, they just speak up in a non-aggressive manner and are not afraid to say that they think there is a problem.

Upper management does not understand Agile and Scrum which causes a lot of frustration and confusion.

Upper management tends to lie to convince you that you are a problem with the hope that you fall in line like sheep.

There is a lot of focus on feature development, but hardly any focus on technical debt. Get features out the quickest way possible and ignore any consequences. No, problem there, right?

There are loads of broken promises. It seems that we are given promises at times to stop us from talking about things with hopes that we would just forget about them. The ""I'll get back to you in a month"" trick gets old.

There is a lot of us vs them.","If you want to be an agile company, understand what agile is and what the intent of our scrum meetings are. We are clearly on different pages from the top to bottom.

Stop the lying tactics to convince us that we are the problem, we are not here to play games! Instead work with us to solve the problems we have at hand.

The condescending remarks have to end! They are not helpful and they kill any sort of passion from your high performing individuals. Do you want us to care, or do you want us to hate? With each condescending remark you push myself and others out of the business. You act like we should be thanking you for a job, but it is a two way street. There are plenty of other companies in Denver that would appreciate us! There are several individuals that are considering leaving which I do not want to see happen, but I cannot say I blame them.

This used to be a fun place to work but the management team is so focused on numbers that customer and actual sales are an after thought. If you enjoy tele-marketing, this is the place for you. If you are a sales professional with a strategy and territory managenent skills I would advise you keep looking and explore other opportunities. 50% of the sales staff has left in the past 5 months. I assure you I will be next.","Keep the CRO Kirk away from customers and the sales team at all costs. You hired and trained good sales managers, let them do their job. I dont need someone calling me every 5 minutes asking if a deal got signed. What, do you think I am going to forget to tell you about it! I don't know who this guy thinks he is but he is the rudest most disrespectful person I have ever delt with. I would also highly advise you train him and the CFO on some basic telephone and communication skills. Every time one of them is on a call I have to immediatly call the customer back and appologize for something stupid they either did or said. The CRO thinks he can just hang up on anyone at any time. ""Your not that important"" Most of these people run organizations 10x larger than Billtrust. I am sure he is good at something?? but managing a sales team and interacting with customers is definatly not it!
There is a lot of talk about the core values but it is clear the dollar makes the final decision.

Customer service has definatly become the last priority. We cant use the majority of our customers as a referance because the are upset about something. FIX THE PROBLEM, dont pass it along. lets not forget that its our customers who helped get us where we are. we cant continue at this rate. Its embarrassing!

Oh ya, and the only reason your customer satisfaction surveys come back some what positive is because you keep sending them to the same people. We know who to keep happy.

The product is hands down the best in the industry, when you look at the full invoice to cash cycle. They have continued to innovate and grow their product suite, both internally as well as through acquisition. This has allowed the sales reps to sell the solution the best addresses their customers needs. Marketing does a great job between trade shows, weekly webinars, email blasts and more to drive a few good sales per territory throughout the year.

From a sales perspective, I thought the goals were very realistic and because it is a very strategic sale, emphasis is places on quality onsite meetings and results. This is a bit of a longer sales cycle, typically in the 4-6 month range. Company invests heavily in technology to help make sales team more productive.

Sales Executives work remote, this was a huge plus for me.

Compensation & Benefits are in line with what you would expect. They also offer stock options, 401k match, Annual Presidents Club Trip (Sales), ect....
