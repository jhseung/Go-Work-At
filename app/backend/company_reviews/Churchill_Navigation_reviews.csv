2017-11-09, Principal HW Engineer,"Boulder, CO",Former Employee ,Company with a unique culture,Company with a unique culture,0,"Companies like Churchill screw it up for us all. Once you worked there, it is difficult to find satisfaction elsewhere. Here is why.
The company has a unique culture - it really feels like a startup, even though it has been around for a decade. Startups often are cash poor and have month-to-month funding worries. Mature companies quickly grow hierarchies, establish business processes, compartmentalization and tight job descriptions - day two sets in.
Churchill Navigation so far avoided both bitter ends. Everyone on board at Churchill is a pro in what they are doing, and day to day you see them doing their magic. The CEO goes to trade shows, explores new product features and establishes business contacts. The Operations manager stays on top of orders, negotiates contracts. Sales and Marketing are on the road and send reports on current sales and upcoming events. SW engineers check in massive amounts of code, and also travel around the world to actually meet their customers. HW engineers build cameras that can pick up a person in pitch black darkness 6 miles away from a moving platform.
There is no one on board writing TPS reports, going from meeting to meeting for visibility, being busy positioning themselves for promotion. It is a flat organization. The only way to get recognized is to tackle complex problems and to bring in revenue. If your idea of work is like a pack of wolves hunting together, Churchill is a good place for you. Especially if you ride motorcycles. Lunch is ordered in every day and like a big family employees of all ranks eat together. That is typically the only meeting of the day. And during that beautifully informal, politically incorrect meeting most everything goes.
The number of lawyers on payroll is zero. And it shows. Based on my experience, as soon as than number increases by as much as 1, fear sets in.
There is no sexual harassment training, there is no unconscious bias training, corporate ethics, or any of the usual BS.
If you do not know how to operate the CNC, do not operate the CNC.
For me, this trust in my judgment went a long way. The fact that within reason I did not have to ask anyone's permissions to order parts, could negotiate with vendors, and did not have to worry about filling out expense reports or budget equipment purchases for the next quarter was refreshing and energizing. This sort of treating everyone as a responsible adult tends to bring the best out of people, and you end up moving mountains every year, making you feel productive and efficient.
It is also liberating that failure is an option. When you join, you'll get exposed to a lot of new, cool technologies, many of which are outside your comfort zone. You will be pushed to learn, and not everything pans out right for the first time. Other companies usually just talk about this, but at the same time stick to hard deadlines, rigid schedules which discourage most engineers from taking risks. At these companies, when sales misses the mark by 50% management understand that the market was hard. When engineering misses the mark by 50%, or takes twice as long, heads are falling. At Churchill, the CEO is an engineer, a tinkerer at heart, who claims not to know anything about anything but at the same time orders devkits and hacks together working systems over the weekend. He understands the unpredictable nature of R&D.
Speaking of things the CEO does well, is eating his own dogfood ;-) Other CEOs either look at SIM/CR statistics (such as how long CRs have been open or how many has been created vs closed last month). Or more often, they hire VPs who worry in their stead, so they can deliver keynotes and talk in superlative terms about their technology. They seldom actually sit down and play with their own products. Remember the late Steve Jobs flipping out how his keys in his pocket scratched up the screen of the iphone prototype while he rode his bike home? Tom Churchill and Steve Jobs must have lived pretty close to one another in Palo Alto. Same thing, Tom religiously tests products in his truck to and from work, and engineers learn first hand if things are not working as expected. The company lives and dies by customer satisfaction, and management cranks to 11 to keep customers happy. And they are.
If you consider joining, this sort of pragmatic, wholistic approach to problem solving from concept to customer is a must.
If you'd like to get your desk raised, pick up a screwdriver and raise your desk, as if this was your own startup.
In fact, the hiring policy reflects this requirement: all candidates have to solve a practical problem, talking the talk will not get you hired if you can't walk the walk.","I wish I started my career at Churchill. For young professionals, I can hardly think of a better place to start. But to hire and retain more senior engineers, the company needs to match compensation packages offered by large players on the field. CEOs make 100x more than junior engineers but can't deliver more code than 100 junior engineers. Still, the market recognizes their unique value added. Perhaps a similar trend exists across the entire continuum of experience levels.
Make sure you negotiate your employment contract well.
Pragmatism is the strength and weakness of the company: PhD types do not do well.","Having a HR person even part time would do wonders. Operations, Product Lifecyce Management and HR require very different personalities (A-type negotiators, beancounters, and touchy-feely types). It is difficult for the same person to fill all 3 roles.
For me one of the key characteristics of the company was the freedom and trust that I can manage my own time. At such a staunchly libertarian company I was surprised by the introduction a one-size-fits-all time-off policy. I believe metrics short of performance reviews but better than butt-in-seat hours would boost productivity and morale.
A dedicated HR professional could help define and administer these metrics/policies, if such policies are deemed unavoidable.",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0
