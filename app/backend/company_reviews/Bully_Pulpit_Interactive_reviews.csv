2017-01-23,,,Current Employee ,Problems run deep,Problems run deep,0,"- Salaries are highly competitive
- Benefits and perks are very good
- If you can ingratiate yourself with the right people early on, you might do well.","Because BPI has grown so rapidly in a short period of time, it still operates much like a startup. As a result:

- New employee onboarding is poor.
- Employee training is spotty.
- Job descriptions and promotion paths are amorphous.
- Team structures are ill-defined.
- Promotions feel arbitrary.
- Cliquishness and favoritism run rampant and have a disproportionate impact on professional advancement.
- Senior staff are highly insular and often fail to communicate vital information to junior staff.","Professionalize:

- Establish standard onboarding and training procedures.
- Build out clear team structures, job descriptions, and paths of advancement.

2016-12-21,,,Former Employee ,Good Place to Begin a Career--Bad Place to Grow,Good Place to Begin a Career--Bad Place to Grow,0,"-Started out as a Fellow at BPI and learned an immense amount in my first few months. Their fellowship training program gave me the tools and skills that I need to succeed as an associate and beyond
-Social culture makes it easy to befriend people in the office, although it can be clicky at times
-Strong CEO with good intentions and relationships with employees
-Great healthcare and benefits, with sickdays and work from home days that do not dock from your vacation","-Despite what BPI claims, the fellowship is not a clear path to employment and as they have recently downsized, it is even less likely that a fellow will be hired. After three months, you will likely get an extension and end up doing associate level work with half of the salary and no benefits instead of being hired as an associate
-The fun/social culture has its downside: People are blatantly favored for being social while the quiet people who work hard are often overlooked. It can be a very loud and distracting work environment
-Your team (pod) may be great but also may also be disorganized: Some pods have their processes, job descriptions, and roles down well while others are disorganized, leading to overworked employees and poor deliverables to clients. This is also a reflection on their generally inexperienced and young management","-Please listen people's feedback. It gets frustrating to voice the same complaints over and over again, only for them to be overlooked. You have lost talented individuals in the past two months due to this issue.
-Consider investing less in client teams and more on the media teams, as we are a media buying firm.
-Please stop removing the bad glassdoor reviews--they are not fraudulent and it only makes the management look shady.",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0
