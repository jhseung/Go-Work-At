First off, I started as a seasonal. The way management treats its seasonal hires was what turned me off from the beginning. The amount of turnover this store experiences is unbelievable. If you're a seasonal, be prepared to have your sales stolen from the established sales people. Management turns a blind eye to this. Favoritism runs rampant; I saw them give a $700+ prize that was meant to be for the top salesman of the holiday season to a favorite, established employee who came in 2nd in sales that quarter. The top salesman was a seasonal that was let go because management didn't like him. I saw this man give all of his effort to making the store profitable, becoming top salesman, just to be stiffed on a prize he deserved more than anyone in that store. This was disgusting and unethical.

This alone would be tolerable if one didn't have to deal with the management structure; Five managers in a store with only eight sales people. The amount of cognitive dissonance I experienced on a day-to-day basis was insane; Managers would often order employees to do things that would contradict what another manager said to do, and they would get borderline passive-aggressive when you hesitated to do something they directed because another manager told you to do something different. Management in this store has some serious communication, and ego-trip issues. I have never felt so disposable, unvalued and unappreciated. I would miss my breaks, because managers would tell me to wait untill they told me it was okay to go, then they would forget. I would remind them and they would become visibly annoyed, ""you should have told me earlier, now I have no coverage!"" ""didnt you just take a lunch?"" Everyday was a constant battle to not just drop everything, quit and walk out of the store. I was coached multiple times a day for such petty, arbitrary reasons. It was exhausting. I'm a hard worker that gave 110% every time I stepped into the store, and yet, management made it very difficult to do my job and make the company money. I could give more examples, but I think you get the picture.

Commission is laughable. Almost not worth the effort. Your hours are cut if you don't sell enough, then you don't sell enough because your hours have been cut. It can become a downward cycle.

Dont get me wrong, I was extremely fortunate to have a job during my finally year in university. I survived two job cuts where 75% of the store's workforce was let go. The head manager is an amazing, friendly and understanding. I owe my job to him. This does not, however, excuse how poor is subordinate managers treated me and the other seasonals.",Leadership has some serious communication and ego issues.

3. “I believe people work for satisfaction. I believe it is a big mistake to think that money is the only way to compensate a person for his work. People need money, but they also want to be happy in their work and proud of it.”

4. “There is no secret ingredient or hidden formula responsible for the success of the best Japanese companies.”

5. “There are three creativities: creativity in technology, in product planning, and in marketing. To have any one of these without the others is self defeating in business.”",3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

No one asked for our opinion as to where we would be shuffled to, what projects and responsiblities we wanted, and with whom we'd like to work with. Isn't that why we originally interview with a company - so we get the best fit for all?

We've gone through layoffs every year since and now another major one has been announced. Most of us (70%) in Finance have been notified - and there's no guarantee that the ones left behind will not go through this again next year... Most likely, they will!

The company is plagued with layers of middle management (Mgrs, Sr. Mgrs, Directors, VP's, Sr VP's).... WHY?????

2014-02-26, Senior Manager,"San Diego, CA",Former Employee ,A good notch for your resume if you can survive a 'House of Cards' environment,More than 5 years,0,"High company recognition - you'll never have to explain what Sony is.

An excellent primer for junior staff and new college grads - due to Sony's fast-paced work environment, you'll be exposed to a lot of business problems and scenarios that will be invaluable later in your career.","Organization Hierarchy - even in it's now leaner levels, Sony is a haven for middle+ management. The company is so awash in Mangers/Senior Managers/Directors/VPs/SVPs/EVPs that it's actually amazing there are people in the organization actually there for the day-to-day execution of actual ""work."" This places even greater stress on those individuals because that smaller section of talent is asked to perform at levels that support the bloated organization.

(Obviously Sony is downsizing, so if you're planning on applying, be sure to ask what the manager : individual contributor ratios are in the DIVISION your applying for.)

Work/Life balance - perhaps one of the worst in places I've worked at. Particularly for technical/engineering jobs - you'll work similar hours to a lean startup... just without the compensation that generally comes with those kinds of environments. This place WILL grind you - and as Sony downsizes this will only get worse, as now the same amount of work to sell, support, and engineer products is delegated to less and less people.

Office politics - cronyism at levels that would rival Government. The intensity of this was directly (inversely) proportional to the health of company. As numbers went down, and layoffs became more common, the environment grew commensurately toxic as working groups and division fought tooth and nail to prevent their silo from being placed on the chopping block. Also, other observations about ""relationships with Japan,"" are accurate - knowing and having strong relationships with people in Tokyo is one of the best ways to ensure job tenure. It's also worth noting that over time, these kinds of environments change both your colleagues and yourself.

Lack of transparency - A lot of the discussions/decisions that many of us would have felt empowered knowing about were kept on a ""need-to-know"" basis - where that ""knowing"" imparted special status among higher management. Of course there are the ""town halls"" - but these very often we're cheer-leading sessions, particularly for products that we're less than stellar. Often felt more like being at a TupperWare party or AmWay conference than a legitimate forum for state of the business.

Low-ball compensation - As a hiring manager, this was a constant struggle in trying to work with HR to get pay ranges for positions in the San Diego location to *at least* at market levels, often times requiring special arrangements to make that happen. This made retaining talent difficult as companies like Qualcomm, Motorola (now Google) and other Engineering shops could offer better packages.

- Raises are paltry, particularly for Tech/Engineering
- Best benefits were reserved for Directors and Up

One NOTABLE exception was the 401K plan - which up until 2012 had a much higher matching contribution rate than market - with a caveat: 2yr vestment before matching contributions kick in.

Not a great place for non-JP engineers - you'll work on some fun projects, but chances are they'll be scrapped, as Sony doesnt have a good track record of supporting products they released that weren't breakout-successes (Aibo, Rolly, Dash, etc.. ).

Company Culture = Culture of your direct Manager - if you had a good Director or VP, then you could potentially be in a very positive environment, otherwise it was merely something in an e-mail that didn't reflect the reality of what you were directly incentivized by from your direct manager.

Lots of outsourcing - even for domestic operations. This essentially created two classes of Sony employees - the ""Blue-Badgers (Full-time)"" and ""Red Badgers (Contractors)"" - and the levels of ownership and collaboration were really almost on a vendor-by-vendor basis. Even more troubling was when vendors had to work with other vendors on Sony projects, as this created weird ""tribal knowledge"" dynamics in an effort to shunt more billable hours to their respective companies. This placed the Sony employees in difficult scenarios, and often Sr. Managers and Directors inherited messes directly created by these dynamics.","Frankly; *go away* - it was incredibly clear that except for a couple of products and operational areas, all objectively quantifiable benchmarks have clearly demonstrated that the Electronics arm of Sony has failed both domestically (US) and Internationally.

Most of middle-management can be gone - and I would the argue same for much of the upper-management as well.",2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

Beautiful building with coffee shop,"The pay is below average and when you consider all the overtime you will put in it's a joke.
Frequent restructuring and changes in management results in complete lack of communication and focus. Office politics and gossip are the most important work you will do all day, next to reviewing the latest version of the org charts. Yearly reviews are not helpful, it's next to impossible to get promoted given the politics and rampant cronyism when it comes to forward career movement. If you find a good manager you've struck gold and that will likely change in the next re-org. Most of the real work is done by vendors and accountability is a mess. No trust between cross functional teams and direct team members. If you're good at something, you'll be doing it until the day you leave.","Remove middle management

As in many large organizations, there is little oversight and accountability, so if you are of the persuasion, you can get away with murder. If you aren't, expect those that are to keep you working 24/7 to carry their dead weight. Corporate culture is staid, conservative and as you can probably surmise, acridly bitter. If you aren't Japanese, you can forget the notion that you will ever be promoted. There are very few western ""lifers"" in the company, and those with a long term investment here are meandering due to low motivation.

Oh and be prepared to be abused for the privilege of working 72 hours. There is no such thing as a thank you or an at a boy, no, just judgment and make sure you give people credit who had nothing to do with the success of a project because they'll call your boss and make a stink.

If you wish to work at the Sony, work for other division besides the Sony US Research Center in San Jose. Major problems exist at the Sony US Research Center.

Fact: I observe this year, over 25% of the technical staff quit and leave. [There is still 1.5 months left in fiscal year.] Typical turnover at other research center - Nokia, HP, IBM is 2-3%. Silicon Valley currently in recession. This number tell you how bad the conditions to be at the Sony US Research Center.

Fact: Head of the research center employed by Sony 20+ years. But, nearly all engineers in the research center have been working at the research center < 5 years. Many are new hire within the last 1 to 2 year. Not a good sign....

Fact: There are big funding issue and job security problem at the Sony US Research Center.

Fact: Upper management dishonest with employees. No transparency.

Fact: The Sony Electronics have company survey. Survey result suppose to be reported to employees by mandate of Sony President. The Sony US Research Center never report results to employees. My understanding based on talk with other employees at the Sony US Research Center. Our results are very bad, very bad, very bad.

Fact: Pay is low. You can confirm if you get job offer here.

- New president in the US with a new perspective to move us forward.","- The biggest con is the office politics. Much of the senior management is dead weight and they lack the vision and direction to guide the company on. The new president has a campaign to make changes but unfortunately he has placed the same old management into these roles instead of cleaning up and bringing in fresh leaders.

The hours you are required to work, coupled with the worst of corporate politics, high school like behavior and mentality just make a career here unsustainable. Case in point: SEL cannot hold onto its ""best and brightest"". The outstanding performers who make a difference continue to walk with no effort seemingly made to retain them. ""The good ones never stay"" has become a sad mantra for those who have watched the departures. Sony has become a very hollow place - it's all about image and window dressing and, like the shiny products, there is nothing meaty to back it up. Employees have very little distinction between personal and professional lives - it becomes one because all you do is work - and way, way below market rate. It's mind blowing to find out what former colleagues are making once they leave. Then there are the exhausting politics. You'll find politics anywhere in life but it is over the top at SEL. It's a full time job to keep up with the backstabbing and mind games. The worst part is you'll find people even at the VP and above level responsible for stirring the pot. If you let employees spend more time focused on the job at hand and less on politics, the company may stand a chance. There are very few to look to in the way of mentors or to even learn management skills from. Some higher ups have spent their entire lives working for only Sony and have coasted along with little skill and no ongoing development. They continue to enjoy the ride while the compnay sinks. Is anyone paying attention?? I plan to be one of the next to leave.","SEL has become a vain place run by ego. That's a rough but true statement.

Very little documentation, such as functional specifications, are created or updated for even the riskiest modules. For SQA, this is an exercise in frustration because what you think is a defect is actually a ""new feature."" And often you are asked to compromise on obvious bugs because the development team desperately wants to meet a closed-defect milestone. Also, at times development exerts too much influence on SQA activities. SQA should be a separate entity working WITH development towards a common goal, not working FOR development. Also hours can be RIDICULOUS often requiring 60-70 hour weeks, with no compensation, just a measly ""thank you"" from upper management. And did I mention they're charging for coffee and tea?

2009-03-18, Engineer,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Life at Sony,,0,"By far, most work there for the brand name ""Sony"". You can go to a store anywhere in the world, and see a product you worked on. If someone asks where you work, and you reply Sony, they know who you work for.

Another good reason to work at Sony is that the company is so wasteful that you are likely to pick up all sorts of castoffs as they are thrown out. This can be anything from a perfectly good remote control to a vehicle that they no longer want.","All groups are like independent companies. No one shares anything. By groups, i mean anything like an entire division like Vaio asking the flat panel TV group for a tool, and the TV group either saying ""go buy your own"" or ""lets get your budget code!"" Or, groups can be just 2 or 3 people within the same business unit. If those guys own something, and you need it, forget it. I have had to hire in temps just to get help in my group while other groups have useful human resources sitting chatting (in Japanense), or surfing the internet.

Also, I have worked there for many years, and never once has anyone offered to train me (or anyone else) on anything. No one gets trained for any job. At Sony job ""training"" is eithics, or company security. I have not received on piece of new information since I have worked there. However, the Japan side does receive a very fair amount of traing and mentorship.. In some case Sony will put an american employee with a Japanense member so the American can train them. This is very typical for someone that is hired with a special skill, that japan must have.

It's also taboo to talk directly to anyone higher up than your group manager. No one does, and we all know what will happen if you go over your manager's head to his boss. You will be eliminated.

Advancement happens to those that keep their mouth shut, do their work, and praise the decisions of their managers. One could stay there for years, just keeping their head down and agreeing with everything. Job loss comes quick to those who don't play along, try to make changes, or doubt the company. Stroking the egos of the Japanese engineers will take you far.

If you work as an engineer in San Diego, here's what to look forward to:

Your ideas will never be heard (they don't even want to hear your ideas!). Creative aspects of the job is all done in Japan.

Engineering in San Diego are nothing more than debuging and modification of Japan's mistakes.

The IT computer network is terrible, email is limited, and there's plenty of down time. We can't even share files with the plants in Mexico, or Japan. Any file must be emailed, or put on a CD and mailed to the recepient. Even though Sony makes computers, very few if any are ever replaced. My desk computer is a PIII built in 1996. Sony has not bought new software in at least 8 years. The office still uses WinXP, and Office 2003. New tools must be snuck in, and so many computers run pirate software just so we can get our jobs done. After Sony's IT staff get's your computer and sets it up on the network, the computer will run so slow that it's basically useless. I just bring my computer in from home, and use a sprint card to do real work (like CAD).

Tools are hard to come by at Sony. Another part of the silo problem. I can't even find a screw driver half of the time to take apart a TV. If you need something like a DVM, forget it, you'll never find one unless you have one bought for you, and hord it at your desk under lock and key. O'scopes are everywhere, but scope probes are nowhere, so we just don't use the O'scopes. Who knows how many issues are misseed because.

Expect a lot of ""Cost Down Activity"". It's just part of the job.

If you came in as say a ""audio engineer"", expect to one day to just be moved to some other job without them consulting you first. One day your the sound guy and the next, your working on tuners, and with no training. My job has changed on me about 4 times now. Sooner or later this is what will drive someone to quit.

Expect your desk to moved at least every 6 months, and your manager to be changed about every year.

Plan on working at least 10 hours a day, and when needed 12, or even 20. Weekends at Sony are typically work days for most engineers. No, you won't get paid for the overtime.

If you find a serious problem, be prepared to prove it with plenty of data. Almost as if you were going to court. If you don't the problem will stay or get solved by someone who had the time to prove it with ""data"" If a manager doesn't want to hear about your issue, expect to present even more data and reports to prove it. Even then, Management may know of the short coming and decide it's a business decision to ship the product with a known defect.

Also be prepared for lifers that are basically useless, to you, the company and the customer. They stay until they are offered early retirement. Some of these guys have worked for Sony for 30+ years.

Watch for the egos of the Japanese engineers. You will need to be humble to them.

Expect to work for years, and never get noticed or advanced.

Don't expect to be doing ""design work"" Design is not done in San Diego.

Oh, and no job is safe. A downturn, and Sony will fire entire divisions with little or no warnings when money is tight. There's no loyalty to US members.

Sony typically offers no stock options, pension, or carreer managment. They do offer 401k match, but the funds in it are not too good, even in good times.

If you're looking for a fun engineering job, in an open culture, with creativity, then keep looking. Sony Electronics is not for you.","Sony's brand means quality, but recent changes to reduce cost are going to ruin this reputation. Without that name, Sony is done.

2008-09-21, Senior Software Engineer,"San Jose, CA",Current Employee ,"Cushy, not shiny.",,0,"It may be because Sony's corporate culture is Japanese, or that it is a global and diversified company but in my few years working there, I've never been seen layoffs or massive budget cuts. Yes, reorganizations have happened and departments were physically moved to other cities in the state but that's the extent of my observations. As such, if I wanted to Sony to be my last employer until I retire, there's a very good chance I could make it happen. And that's saying something for a Silicon Valley employer.

Sony Electronics makes a lot of products, a lot of gadgets and has R&D teams behind all of them. Surely, there's more than one that will benefit from your expertise. The diversity and quantity of the projects at Sony is another plus it's got for itself. And no matter what consumers may think down the line of our products, they still ship. Oh yeah, that's right, you'll be working on products that ship. That's another thing not every Silicon Valley business can say.","Working in a Japanese company in the U.S. will be seen by most as an opportunity at first. Well, after some time, it becomes a challenge. And after more time, it can be a downright hindrance to progress as you imagine it in your non-Japanese mind. My personal contact with Japanese business people is non-existent. That means I get no exposure to the cultural aspect of the business but all the exposure to its decisions that I often don't understand. That can be frustrating at times. Mind you, that's true for any foreign company that has opened shop in the U.S. But, let's just say that some foreign companies are more foreign than others.

Sony is not a software company. It's CEO recognizes that and wants it to change but, personally, I don't feel like waiting the 20 years for it to happen. For instance, there is no sense of community for people like me at the company level.

If you love the category (consumer electronics) you will appreciate access to the latest and greatest technologies. International exposure (mostly with Tokyo and US-based Japanese colleagues) is a plus, especially if you plan on having an international management role later on. Linkages with Playstation and Sony Pictures are strong and getting stronger, so there are interesting opportunities that arise due to those relationships like getting to attend premieres, previews of new films, and the chance to do strategic partnerships. Breadth of business is incredible, so exposure to all sorts of media and technology business happen with great frequency.","Not a great environment for an MBA-type. Very old school, and old boys club in terms of environment. ""Post Office"" type of organization where keeping your head down, developing relationships, and just being at the office will eventually move you up the ladder or at least create strong job security. Not a place for people who want to rise quickly and make change happen. This will probably chnage as company becomes more and more impacted by the rise of newcomers to industry (Smasung in TV, Apple in portable devices, etc) but the overall stratification of the organization will make rapid changes difficult to deploy. Also a very Japanese-centric work environment on a number of fronts -- employees often work 8-midnight in order to get the US business complete while waiting for Tokyo to ""wake-up"" and provide direction. Not a true marketing organization, but instead a ""sales office"" -- this means that many decisions need to have the input and/or arte made by the teams in Tokyo. Because of this the Sales Organization is the powerhouse of the company and has tremendous power, which makes marketing even less impactful.","This could be a great company but it seems divided into two camps: lifers who tend to have come in as very low level employees (this includes many of the senior management folks) and new blood who either decide to become lifers or who give up and leave. It's also a very nave;-gazing culture -- I have seen employees interviewed for marketing jobs who don't actually know what the 4 P's are simply because they are alredy employed at Sony.

Employees of Sony are well compensated in all areas and have potential to earn more based on performance.","On of the many downsides was the lack of training that is given within the first 3 months I started. It was very sparse and much of it was ""learn as you go"" as management would shuffle you around to others before getting the answer to questions. There was also a severe lack of leadership on senior and direct supervisor management. Much of the time, the support that was given only when it benefited them and was absent when it did not.
