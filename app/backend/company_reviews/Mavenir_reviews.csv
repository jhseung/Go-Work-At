But Mavenir is the only company with worst HR policies along with worst HR team. (They act lika a Govt Employess, takes a week to give one HR letter)

Worst Team Management & leadership.
I my may team my manager wanted his subordinates just to say yes even for impossible things...which did not happen. So he started making his own team by recruiting all the team from his ex-company...Now Team is with all his ex employee and one fresher from infosys (I heard he is also searching)

If you want to survive, you must be best in politics & blame game so excel in your career with Mavenir. If you are bad in this, even if you are techincally gud...This is not the company for you.

I forgot to mention....When we as a team(all the teammates) when we gave compliant against manager about all this, it did fireback, as they were intrested in makeing ppl to leave instead of resolving the issue.

If you are very gud in blame game , religious activities & politics.....best company for you",Its a waste of time giving advice to management as they failed when we gave & made us (all the team) to leave the company,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
