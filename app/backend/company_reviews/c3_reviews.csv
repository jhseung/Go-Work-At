Lots of ignorant people
Favoritism
Cliques.
Immature Co-workers.
. I suffered emotional abuse, harassment and bullying from my co-workers and it only got worse when I went to HR and to my supervisors to address the issue.
If you are that DESPERATE enough for a job, I HIGHLY recommend you look elsewhere. Don't come here. It isn't worth the heartache or the trouble. To everyone currently working there now. I feel BAD for you. This is the best job you are ever going to get.","When someone tells you they are being harassed and bullied by several people on a campaign, believe them. I quit because of the unprofessional-ism at that place. It's worse than high school. It's just a bunch of angry, middle- aged and elderly people who peaked early in life who are upset because they aren't skilled or capable enough to have a REAL SUSTAINABLE career taking out their frustrations on those of us who have real aspirations and dreams outside of working in a call center.

I am lucky enough that I found a job in what I went to school for and that I left this terrible place. This center should be shut down and especially everyone on the AON campaign needs to be fired. I suffered emotional abuse, harassment and bullying from my co-workers and it only got worse when I went to HR and to my supervisors to address the issue. I ended up trying to take my own life due to the severity of my bullying that no one seemed to care about trying to stop. I have moved on to a job that I love, but NO ONE deserves to be treated so poorly and then have management take the side of the instigators and abusers in the situation. 0/0 Would not recommend.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
