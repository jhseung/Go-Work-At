2018-08-22, Fullstack Engineer,"Palo Alto, CA",Former Employee ,Great workplace to intern and learn a variety of skills,Less than a year,0,"- High engineering standards which translate to learning how to write code that is maintainable, well-tested, and readable.
- Because it's a lean team, you're given plenty of opportunities to learn about different aspects of the business. Despite being hired as an engineering intern, I've learned about data science, marketing, and growth in my short time here (3 month internship).
- Direct interaction with senior leadership who you can lean on for asking questions, and who are willing to do 1-on-1 mentorship discussions.","- Because the company is moving fast, it's tough to document all the ongoing projects in a very detailed way. This can mean a steeper than average learning curve when starting work on a project.
- The engineering team is now spread out over 3 offices, and working remotely can bring its own challenges (more challenging to collaborate, time-zone differences, reviews can take longer than expected).",- Continue making your employees feel involved in the decision making process.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

And all they did was pull him out and made him apologize to me and then 6 days later I was terminated. If a employee apologizes for their actions that means that they confess of their wrong doing.

Gobble is hemorrhaging money and it's only a matter of time before you get shut down for lack of proper food handling and storage.

Each day I am challenged to become the best version of myself and to share that with a team of people who are doing the same thing. Everyone has a common goal and purpose which is to provide families with amazing healthy and easy to prepare meals.

There are a lot of challenges along the way each day, after all it is still food service, but the core team of players from CEO to Forklift Operators, to Kitchen Prep to GM's and the Chefs all have a lot of passion and grit.","The management seems to focus on only hiring the best, which causes longer delays in hiring. That sometimes means you have to wear a lot of hats, and it takes longer to move singular projects along when you are working on 12. That being said, when the new hires do come, they usually provide not only excellent value, but a level of ownership that catapults the company ahead in huge leaps and bounds.","Continue to hire smart, passionate, and engaging people.

Employees can get a week's worth of meals for free!",The company observed holidays aren't as many as I was acustomed to. This is because high quality perishables don't have a long shelf life.

2018-06-13, Associate,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Associate,More than a year,0,"Mid-level to low-level employees have ample opportunity to shoulder new responsibility, contribute to process improvement, and exercise some independence. At Gobble, pressing and consequential challenges are omni-presentâ€” the company celebrates the 'True Grit' needed to succeed during periods of growth and change.

When you are willing to work beyond the expectations of your role, you can learn a lot here.","The company is highly segmented. In one office, a hushed 'hunker down and quietly get your work done' awkwardly prevails. Infectious laughter, a fun, work-hard-with-commiseration, another, almost unrecognizable culture prevails elsewhere. This is illustrative of Gobble. Weeks are hard-won and lessons difficultly learned due to the compartmentalization of teams and their routine lapses in communication.

The company is ambitious and its leadership insulated and inaccessible. The channels for cross-functional or top-to-bottom communication are weak, while the role of each and every individual is highly demanding. Through some combination of these factors, employees earning an hourly wage work well beyond the hours reported on their time cards. This generally goes unacknowledged, or worse, unnoticed completely.

Mid to low-level employees are hired at uncompetitive wages, and once hired, are implicitly expected to work as a salaried employee or contractor might, working until particular projects are complete, no matter what odd, interfering circumstances have precipitated out of the 'fast-paced startup' environment.

I have sometimes seen growth and change come at the cost of good will and morale.","Sincerely check-in with your people; pay attention to how much people are working. Gobble is a big-hearted company with a really loving, special concept; build mutual loyalty and appreciation with your employees, and get good folks to stay on board with you.",3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

2018-02-06, Team Member,"Stockton, CA",Former Employee ,Miserable environment to work in,More than a year,0,The CEO has an amazing vision of what she wants this company to be for both customers and employees.,In this warehouse the only people who seems to get in trouble is the team members and all the higher ups get to do whatever they want talk to people however they want and we were just expected to take it and deal with it if we wanted to keep our jobs. There is an astronomical amount of favoritism going on. The team members do not have anyone on site that they can express their concerns or issues with. Operation managers are going out drinking with team members. Most of the higher ups are unapproachable. Unfortunately at the Stockton location management has gotten so lost in their own problems and arguments with each other they have completely lost sight of what's best for the customer and team members. I don't not believe the CEO's vision is being played out at this location.,My advice wouldn't be to Managment my advice is to Ooshma! I truly believe in your vision for this company however with that being said I strongly suggest you take a good look at the people you have working for you and make sure they want the same things you do cause from my point of view they don't.

2017-12-26, Kitchen and Packing,"Stockton, CA",Former Employee ,Has potential,Less than a year,0,A few of the leads are outstanding.. Lots of hours available to those willing to work. Owner Ooshma is wonderful. Alot of exciting things coming up foe company.,"Im basing off of stockton office only.. In office Managers are very rude and disrespectful. Cursing and speaking to lower level employees in a very rude and unprofessional manner. In office managers and MOST but not all leads are very close so complaints against mangers attitudes and manners towards others fall on deaf ears. Managers will blame empoyees for their mistakes and write them up for it. They will tell you to go home if you are sick and write you up for it. There is alot of favoritism.. Some employees will receive 3 write ups and be fired some have had 14-15 write ups. Some are only given one chance after final write ups and some have up to 7 incidents after final write ups before being fired. Alot of employee relationships. Leads sleeping with lower level employees. Managers sleeping with in office workers. i could go on but will stop here. no chance for advancement unless related, sleeping with or have a great friendship with managers in office.",My advice isn't to managment because i have spoken to them already my advice is to Ooshma and Brian.. You could have a really great company if you had the right people managing it.. Although numbers are met you don't know what goes on in your warehouse. You really should start a whole new team. Kitchen leads are the only ones who respect and know how to manage and treat their employees.. Really take a look into your books and see how many employees have come and gone from your company. Some are still there with attendance and incident reports that others have been fired for. You say you want a company that works togther and treats each other like family.. Family is not what i was treated like in your company and i was very disappointed because i loved the company and what it stood for and was looking forward to see all that was coming for it.. But to be honest i suggest you really look into what goes n there and how employees are treated before you wind up with a lawsuit on your hands.,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,

Smart, energetic employees are underutilized. There is a lack of definable company culture, because the CEO and senior management do not create opportunities for employees to get to know each other and thus, there is a serious lack of communication and collaboration between teams.

Tremendous ability to learn and grow, but not for the lazy or uninspired. Great benefits package, and equity share at the early stages, and expansion seems imminent.","Lean team makes it difficult to move some projects forward as fast as you like them to be, because there is not enough hands to get the work done. That puts a lot on the individuals who work there. Strong personalities who are fully engaged in the company's success over everything else leaves little time for a personal life at times.

CEO cares nothing about the customer or the employees;has people in managerial positions that have no idea how to treat and respect employees. Complaints fall on deaf ears, delivery issues were not a priority. If you dont kiss butt and snitch on everything other employees do your expendable. When something goes wrong you are treated as if you personally messed up. They are data driven and not customer oriented.. week after week of unsatisfied customers. Your looked down on when the work load is more than the staff you have and week after week problems with delivery, bad food, incorrect product packed.","Treat all employees the same, follow the TEAM motto. Talk to your management team on how to talk and treat employees with respect and intelligence. People depend on their jobs and letting one employees dislikes, lies and temper tantrums cause other employees to lose their job is absolutely wrong maybe you should stop and look at that individual and way they can not get along with their co-workers.
