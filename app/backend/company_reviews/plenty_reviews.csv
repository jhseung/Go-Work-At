I was not the favourite. I was often told by manager to go off to the food court to get her food.. Very poor training as well.

2016-03-01, Sales,,Former Employee ,Previous Employee,More than a year,0,"Good discount, nice product. The sales team were easy to get along with and the hours were flexible (as with many retail jobs).","Very low pay, ineffective management that never fought for/stood up for employees. Family-run company, with lots of nepotism and a questionable ability to do the job.

Inconsistent hours, especially if you are promised full-time hours, this can be detrimental to budgeting/making rent. Direct deposits sometimes didn't happen on time, and cheques could only be cashed when you're told it's ok.

During busy/holiday seasons, they essentially make you sign an averaging agreement. If you say no, there seems to be a good chance you could lose your job/have a bad ""rep"" in the company, which I'm sure is illegal.

A lot of direction from head office would contradict itself, making the employee look untrained or incapable of doing their job in front of customers.","Listen to your front-line employees, they deal with the customers directly and give valuable information.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Team turnovers led to a new manager that talked crap about her employees behind their back and acted pretentiously to the point where the entire team of staff quit almost simultaneously. That tells you something. Very little growth opportunity in the company as well and one of the only companies I know that start their sales associates off at minimum wage.","Work on consistency when hiring to ensure that the employees and managers accurately represent the brand; the company is good, the only problem I had was with management.",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
