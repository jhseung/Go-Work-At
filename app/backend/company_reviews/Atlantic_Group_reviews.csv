2017-03-01, Anonymous Contractor,"New York, NY",Former Contractor ,Horrible Expeience,Horrible Expeience,0,They found me a position very quickly,Operations people are incompetent and lack common sense.,"This place has made too many payroll mistakes. First of all they pay on the 15th and last day of the month which is unheard of for temp/contract roles. I waited 4 weeks to get paid and they didn't have a check for me, nor did anyone reach out to inform me of the reasons why. I would never recommend anyone to this agency. They are horrible to work for and just don't cut it like other established agencies. If the reach out to you it might be best to run or else your trapped in a non-traditional temp/contract role which you will work for a month before you see your first paycheck.",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
2016-02-13,,,Former Employee ,Consultant,Consultant,0,"Few... The only pro is that they find a lot of job opportunities for candidates. That said, the opportunities are across a wide spectrum.","Several.... They claim to perform a deep dive into a candidate's background in order to have a strong grasp on where a candidate stands in regards to their background, experience level, credentials, career aspirations, etc. They do not. They deceptively and aggressively sell you on a role by providing equivocal and often times ""cookie cutter"" job descriptions. Furthermore, they will nickel and dime your contract to the point that they are making more money per day or hour than you are... Consequently, you find yourself perplexed, defeated, and taken advantage of only a few weeks into your new career aka nightmare. In my honest opinion, there was a definitive lack of integrity, client-centric focus, and industry expertise.",,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
