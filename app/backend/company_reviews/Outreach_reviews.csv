My manager was very caring and a straight shooter.

They send you to Seattle for training and you get to go to sales conferences if you're a good performer.

I watched the top reps in the company leave on their own because management did not promote them, after over exceeded quota for a year straight. Becoming a ' senior SDR' isn't a promotion, it's an ego boost. If you want to get promoted at Outreach, be a good rep rather than a top rep.
Outreach is not organized and everything is constantly changing. Quotas, compensation plans and more change on a monthly basis. If you are looking for consistency, stay away.

If you're an SDR find a company that has a clear path to promotions, rather than the one they have at Outreach.","Stop making top reps waste 1-3 hours of their week doing pointless training sessions. The top reps know how to cold call and shouldn't be required to waste their time doing it.
Weekly meetings are a big waste of time. Most things can be sent out in an email. Why waste time sitting in on an hour long meeting, then be required to view an hour long video and answer questions about the meeting we just had?

- Company culture: values individual contribution and development, as well as working hard as a team to deliver value to customer
- Team dynamics: very collaborative. You can feel that people enjoy working with each other toward a common goal
- Technology stack: is very modern. Plus the team relentlessly look at what can be evolved / improved over time
- Personal growth: there are so many things you can work on to deliver value, and the team keeps on expanding. Lots of opportunities for learning and career growth
- Company outlook: current market leader, still on the path of fast upward trajectory","- Benefits are still not that impressive (but become better gradually)
- There is some ""implicit"" peer pressure to make you work overtime to deliver, since everyone else is working very hard. But this is expected at a startup. Also at a manageable level
- Hiring/expanding pace is very fast, sometimes you will feel a little lost with so many new faces popping around",Keep up the great work so far! Don't lose focus,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

They are very down-to-earth as well, encouraging personal and professional growth, and sharing of both highs and lows often. This is important to me because we are all working together, we are all a team, and we all need to know that we are still human, making mistakes and hitting rough patches is part of life, but with a group effort, we can help each other.

They are careful about who they hire, looking closely at culture fit and skills. I really enjoy working with my colleagues, and there's a lot of cross functional collaboration.

Outreach management is incredibly transparent in regards to financials, goals, pipelines, etc. I've never worked for a company that so actively encourages the spread of information and news, which is used to get people excited about reaching goals.

There's also a gaming group, that plays during lunch on most days, and weekly after work. It's nice to have people that are willing to take a break and connect and have fun with their colleagues.","The company is still small, which means there aren't as many of the benefits you'd get from larger companies, but I think that's a very small issue.","Keep up the great work! Remember that happy employees are productive employees. Keep reaching for new ways to grow, and new ways to dazzle our customers. I'm very blessed to be working for Outreach!",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The product is excellent and is the leader in the market - customers love it and depend on it everyday. There's a lot of pressure to work hard and make yourself / team better everyday, and I certainly value that. Very much a startup environment where there is a ton to get done, which makes very day interesting and allows for a lot of new opportunities. Strong sales and heavy investment / hiring also creates a lot of opportunity for folks. The team is extremely collaborative and people are very open to feedback and good about providing constructive feedback.
