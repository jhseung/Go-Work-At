The only way to move up is to apply to a position once it becomes available. Those positions mostly are people management positions and the company seems to hire those without any proper people management skills.

Management will also let their talented individuals leave the company without trying to keep them. Everyone seems replaceable.

The New York office is also segregated from the rest of the company. There's minimal HR presence and no culture to be had. That office has become a very sad place to work on a daily basis. Senior Management are either fully remote or hide out in their offices.

No, in some of them it only matters if you are willing to work tons of extra hours for no extra pay, and kiss up to certain people.
I did work with some great people here. I also worked in a position that I loved, and was very good at - only to have to leave that department and position because I was told I would never get promoted, because the Director's buddy was going to get it instead (and that my experience didn't matter). And, mine is not the first or last story to have that ending.
Finally, just know that as a compliance employee, you will be treated as a minion/peasant by the CEO and his people. After all, they all went to a brand new glitzy building, and stuck compliance a mile away in an old building that has seen better days.

Recently lots of offshoring, stifling turnaround time on development, sync on requirements or issues, and meetings with India folks became very early in the morning or late at night. Lots of architectural dependencies on multiple systems, causing long turnaround of product launches that can bring huge value to the business. High turnover rate in staff and management. Because of this, you are constantly spending time dealing with new folks who need to be brought up to speed. Big changes with each new management that come in, without preparation ahead for the negative impacts that should be so obvious to any good leader with a brain. So either they don't care, or they are not experienced enough to foresee them. Be prepared to work with developers with no clue on how to keep the code base intact. Lots of bugs discovered during UAT phase, and often a fix breaks something else. No accountability when escalations occur, which means weak individuals stay for a long time, slowly decaying any motivation and good culture that's left out of the org.
Heavy processes set in place, too many approvals required from various stakeholders before being able to start development or before a launch. The lack of trust is warranted however. So many production bugs found should've been obvious to anyone who knows the business fairly well. Again it's caused by 1) contractors offshore with below average knowledge in the business, 2) product teams are not on the same page in terms of the user experience or prioritization of features. Expect very little before a planned release, something will come up and delay launch.
Diversity is lacking. Prepare to feel out of place if you are a hard working individual who wants to do the right things. You will work lots of hours doing ad hoc stuff for your manager that's not expected any place else, mostly because other people are not doing their jobs.","Keep the good guys, and get rid of the toxicity.

-Upper management is out of touch with the 9-5 employee.
-If you work in Operations just be weary. Your job could be outsourced to Vilnius at really any time.
-The pay is ok for starters (0-4 years of experience), but any manager who is aggressive about career development is under paid. If one isn't a go-getter then his/her salary is probably in-line with the industry, but any go-getter who stays with WU is essentially taking a big pay cut. An analyst role with a big firm will pay one more than a senior manager role with WU. I guess what i'm trying to say is that there isn't much advancement in terms of salary to be found at WU for a serious career minded employee. The company higher ups like to say that they conduct studies to ensure their pay is in-line with the industry, but they don't understand that top talent needs to be paid MORE than the industry. To put it simply, WU is utterly incapable of keeping top talent because they pay an average wage, and what happens when you pay top talent an average wage? Just ask WU HR, they're kept mighty busy filling and refilling the same positions...","-Take down all the signs about how ""the customer always comes first"" or ""it begins with the customer"" and take a page out of Richard Branson's book.

Look i get it, you tried one approach and a good one too, but after 5+ years here I can say that it hasn't worked and nothing has changed.

Decent pay and benefits. Decent severance package when you get laid off. Nice on-site amenities that will soon go away when they sell their campus and downsize to leased space in a high rise (Red flag),"Where do I begin?
The company is in a constant state of flux and reorganization in hopes of saving what is a company dying a slow death.
Constant...and I mean constant...reorganizations of the business. Not only is this a problem, but the bigger problem is the reorgs involve the same leadership that is still stuck in the prehistoric retail location business model that is causing the company to die to begin with. It’s the same people in different positions. The proverbial shuffling the deck chairs on the ship mentality. No matter how you arrange the chairs...it’s still the same chairs.
There needs to be a complete overhaul of the leadership team. That isn’t happening with the current board. Meanwhile, competitors and fintech startups offering better, cheaper, faster are rapidly eating away at WU’s market share resulting in very low single digit growth.
In order to show growth, the company is cutting in other areas resulting in constant layoffs. Every November a d December involve mass layoffs. It’s a holiday tradition at WU. Although this year it went well into the spring.
The company is closing offices all over the world and consolidating. The most evident is putting their global headquarters campus they own up for sale and leasing several floors of a high rise just north of their current location. Again. Cutting costs in order to show what little growth they can.

To those interested in joining this company:
-Be ready for layoffs. Lots of them...under the disguise of the “WU Way.” AKA how to cut costs but still be able to pay for things like million dollar building ribbon cutting events, $15m logo sponsorships with sports teams and multimillion dollar salaries for execs.

-Be ready to deal with plenty of politics and heiarchy. It’s real at WU which operates very much in an old school heiarchal workforce model, which in turn impedes growth and decision making

-Be ready to work for a company getting its tail kicked by competitors including PayPal, Venmo and Transferwise. WU is trying to market to millennials but missed that boat years ago. It’s only a matter of time before the majority of their migrant market is able to utilize these new services and will leave WU for better, faster, cheaper. Money transfer is becoming a commodity market and will soon go the way of how services are bought such as cable, internet and cell phones. WU can’t get in a price war because they can’t afford to...mainly because they have to keep their 550,000 locations afloat...therefore sticking to the prehistoric business model and continuing in the death spiral.

-Be ready for lots of bosses. Turnover is real and talented execs are leaving and others constantly being forced out.

-Be ready for lots of processes, protocols and review. Thing is it bogs down performance and getting work done. The company has launched one new website the entire year. One. And that was for Kuwait of all places 😂😂",Take your package and leave. Hopefully the company will find a sucker to buy them or a miracle will happen and actually finds a leadership team that operates in the modern day century.,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Very few managers I encounter have any expertise in the work their people do, nor does there seem to be a willingness on their part to learn what their people do.

I have seen evidence of speaking truth to power gets you fired - as in gone the next day.
Almost everyone on my team is beaten down, even though they are highly skilled and self motivated. If you were to take management away, the team could fix 70% of issues within 3 months or less.
