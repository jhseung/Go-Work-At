2018-04-12, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Awesome engineering culture, poor direction",More than 3 years,0,"Braintree prides itself on having a great engineering culture, and it really does. If you're passionate about building and shipping quality products, this is a great place to do it and learn from some really smart folks. Leadership takes the time to understand problems surfaced by engineers, and makes an effort to remove tech debt. It is truly a great engineering culture. Effort is also made for employees to invest in themselves, by sending employees to two conferences a year. In addition, every other Friday is reserved for learning working on passion projects or work projects where you might not ordinarily have time.

Benefits are really good. PayPal offers a competitive 401k match, health care offerings are great, and time off is generous. Because we pair at Braintree, the hours are pretty strictly 9-5 which is hard to beat.","In my time at Braintree, PayPal has gone from a faraway entity which cuts your paychecks to an overbearing presence, and frankly, a constant downer on your day to day work. Since it acquired Braintree, PayPal seems to not know what to do with it. More and more PayPal uses Braintree as a crutch for its own bad tech. Like every inexperienced film director saying, ""we'll fix it in post,"" PayPal leans on Braintree to power products that it cannot deliver itself.

PayPal has done a lot of good things with Braintree, but by slowly removing the sheen from Braintree's pristine engineering culture, we have seen and will continue to see the hiring bar fall to the level of PayPal, and Braintree will no longer be the great place to work that it is now.",Stop letting PayPal leech away your values.

1. We're a product company who's mission is customer success. When you, as a engineer, are arguing with your peers about what the best outcome for your customers is - you know you're working at the right place.

This isn't always a good thing. For a company that has touted itself for its transparency, that has been slowly decreasing as more questions from employees have gone unanswered. There's also a tough challenge with favoritism amongst certain teams, which is difficult to overcome when teams are still small as news spreads quite quickly. There's also a growing concern for the company's response to its lack of diversity.

Becomes more and more like PayPal every passing quarter, both culturally and in terms of management/goals. These are not positive changes.

You are working for PayPal. Whatever comes to your mind when you think of PayPal is probably correct. You're not innovating with sexy tech.

The startup bones are still there in the form of completely unqualified management. Early hires are managing large departments and they shouldn't be. There are a lot of elephants in the room.

-Long-term career support and lots of opportunities to transfer to other PayPal family companies as your own life-goals evolved.","Real talk: The work we do is hard. Period. And it's not a product of Braintree as a company.

It's deeply challenging work by its nature. We're building the least visible but most important piece of most companies' business. Day-to-day few companies are deeply passionate about their payments processor (as opposed to, like, their merchandise or marketing efforts...)--- but if there is any difficulty in that revenue stream, it's a huge, huge deal. While it's the best job I've ever had, it's certainly also the hardest. Not a job for the faint of heart. It's a career, a commitment. And that's not for everyone.

Being part of the PayPal family does mean some more structure to certain policies and the occasional bureaucratic mandates, but the leadership team here does a great job of shielding us from the major inconveniences. But know coming in that, yeah, you're gonna have to go through some eye-rolls to get a legal document executed or to organize an event. It's not often, but we're not a start up anymore and you shouldn't expect to do whatever you want without formal checks.

That said. The still-pretty-flat structure we have on our teams, built out of our start up legacy, does mean that your job is what you make of it. Reading through the other reviews, comments of ""lacking leadership"" or ""big learning curve"" or ""not much guidance in career paths"" resonate-- but it's not the management's fault. Because there's not really a ton of management to hold responsible. The only person holding you back here is you, and that's hard in its own right. There's a huge opportunity to carve out your role in an established-but-always-evolving team. If you don't put in the effort to define your work, it can be uncomfortable-- but it's really your own fault.

The hiring process is intense. We are deeply pickly. I think we sometimes miss really great candidates because we have almost-unattainably-high standards. But, I guess, the people that DO make it are pretty spectacular and stay around forever-- so what the (awesome) recruiting team does might be working.

2015-09-04, Product Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Generous, Stable, Supportive Culture and Team",Less than a year,0,"I write from the perspective of the San Francisco office.

* The compensation (at least in product/engineering, don't know others) is generous with solid benefits/perks, like delicious lunches 4 days/week

* The team and culture are very low-drama, low-BS. Titles are pretty flat, and manager/subordinate relationships all seem pretty healthy.

* Almost every role is pretty much 9-to-5/6-ish, with little pressure to look busy or make bogus work

* Occasional work-from-home and cutting out for a doctors appointment, etc., are pretty flexible as long as you're being reasonable

* Though owned by Paypal, Braintree operates reasonably independently. Management does a good job of shielding the org from corporate pressures.

* The company is growing, building new stuff, and being pretty successful, which helps keep morale high

* The company invests solidly in employee happiness, with workshops, off-site events, and regular happy hours/fun events

* The physical office space is masterfully designed to feel human and warm. No rows of 30 sterile standing desks here.

* While broad industry demographics apply – engineers tend to be male, etc. – the culture is very welcoming to all, and the leadership team represents a broad spectrum of ethnicity/gender/orientation.","Honestly, there are not many cons: it's definitely a 5-star company. But there are certain things to be mindful of that may make it the wrong company for some people:

* While everyone is pleasant and morale is high, there doesn't seem to be very much outside-of-work social activity between coworkers. (Your mileage may vary).

* While Braintree operates pretty independently from Paypal, it is still an established 300-ish person org inside a 14,000-ish person public company. Certain things will involve bureaucracy/approval.

The closest things I have to actual drawbacks compared to some competitors are:

* Flat-ness makes career advancement paths within the company less obvious. Some people have had great advancement trajectories, so it's very possible, but it's not well-articulated how to get on that path.

* Paypal's 401k provides a fine-but-not-amazing 4% match, has somewhat underwhelming fund choices, and doesn't allow super backdoor Roth's (though only a very few firms do allow that)","* Keep doing all the good stuff you're doing

* Keep vigilant about creeping red tape or bureaucratic slowness

* Be careful that the focus on building product doesn't make people in other job roles to feel unappreciated

* Better articulate career-advancement paths within the company

* Improve the 401(k)",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

2015-05-10, Support Treep,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Great workplace!,Less than a year,0,"I was hired fairly recently and work as part of the support staff. Many other reviews go over the same pros, but:
- Amazing office with a variety of different conference rooms, lounges, little comfy spaces that would suit almost anyone
- Automatically adjustable desks so you can switch between standing and sitting as often as you like
- Super transparent management that really cares and treats you like adults (this is weirdly rare in support jobs and I value it a lot)
- Great coworkers - literally everyone I've met has been kind and welcoming
- They value diversity... the company recently sponsored a fellowship for Dev Bootcamp for underrepresented gender/racial groups. I also feel like they really value having employees that are different. Some of the people there are quirky, and it seems like this is not only accepted, but valued.
- I work on a team of mostly men (which I was nervous about) but they have all been so kind and welcoming and inclusive
- Super delicious coffee, snacks, beverages, and daily catered lunches
- Flexibility to work from home on days you're not feeling great but aren't so sick you need a PTO day
- Very affordable medical/dental/vision benefits as well as a multitude of other great benefits (transit reimbursement, generous PTO, sabbatical after 5 years)
- Fair, competitive compensation","- Sometimes it does feel like working in a Silicon Valley episode... But honestly that's not really a con.
- I feel a little unclear on what a career path might look like there and what kind of opportunities I would have in the future, but I've only recently started and haven't taken the time to ask.","Keep up the good work!

2015-04-21, Illinois,"Chicago, IL",Current Employee ,Designer,,0,"Wonderful perks - probably the best in the area. Open dev days were you get to work on whatever you'd like, 2 paid conferences a year (and they cover all your expenses). Everyone gets brand new equipment - macbook pro and cinema display. Tons of free swag that keeps on coming (backpacks, shirts, hoodies, thermo bottles, etc). Health/time off benefits are nice. Laid back, open atmosphere. A beautiful new office in the Merchandise Mart. Catered lunch everyday from really good local places. Snacks and drinks on hand at all times. A wellness room, mother's room, bar with kegs on tap, high end ping pong and foosball tables, scooters to get around the office, etc. And there's even more then that and they are open to new ideas to help improve the space.

As for the work, it's challenging and motivating. You may think, ""what would I do as a designer at a company like Braintree?"" But there is A LOT. The design team is broken up by product, and visual. Product as it states, works on our products - really making a difference in how our users/merchants are able to use what we build, and they make it beautiful. They are a hybrid of designer and developer. Visual works on a lot of brand design including materials for events, new programs, swag, and a lot of other internal projects. They make Braintree look good.

A product company like Braintree is a great change coming from an agency - there aren't annoyances like time sheets to fill out or a push for a strict process. There are no pitches you are required to work late nights and weekends on. Rarely will you work on a weekend or after hours. You don't have clients, and you are really able to influence your work. And you're compensated for your work, not how high you move up - in fact hierarchy on the team is very minimal. If you want to be a designer here, you can be a designer. You don't need to stop designing in order to escalate your career. And we work together and there isn't that sense of competition.","Downsides come from Braintree having a start up mentality - what feels like downsides are more like challenges. We have an opportunity to really shape what we want our team to be - how much process do we really want? Where do we need hierarchy in our team? How do we want to work with the other teams in the office who may have a different mentality and different goals then us? It can be frustrating at times, and not everyone always feels on the same page... but if you look at the big picture it's it's nice to know we can make mistakes and try new things to find what works best for us.

Another con in some people's eyes would be the fact we use an outside agency to develop our branding. We split a lot of work between the agency and our visual design team. It feels like 2 different teams working on 1 common goal, and that can bring inconsistencies in the work and goals of the brand. To be fair, our visual team is small - so the task of rebranding Braintree wasn't an option to do in house. It's been a challenge finding a way to work together, and have a voice on the overall brand. But again, it's a learning experience and finding how we can contribute and where we can make an impact is something we are working on and making strides towards.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Very competent developers
Big focus on security
Pair programming
Test driven development
Low tech debt in the codebase (there is always tech debt in all codebases in the world... but Braintree has a ""higher level"" of tech debt- there are very few inane problems that need refactoring. Most of it is like ""well, this codebase has evolved organically and we need to do a structural refactoring to make it more extensible"", not like terribly named variables and unextracted methods etc.
Great support for users of the product (I feel totally confident recommending the product to friends)
Polyglot developer culture
Catered lunch
Great time off policy (officially two weeks, but in reality ""as much as you want"" and no stigma for using it- lots of people do doctor appointments, short vacations etc without stressing about it)
Good at work-from-home (actual communication)
Good internal communication channels through chat (Slack)
Kanban workflow with weekly monday morning IPM
Very 9-to-5 (although big events mean that certain senior developers usually have to be online and responsive over New Years, Black Friday etc)","Excessive focus on ""startup"" activities like drinking, playing video games in the office. Full-size arcade games installed in the front room.
There is some interference by the owning company in daily activities, especially when it comes to scheduling conference rooms, building improvements (bathrooms), maintenance

2015-01-07, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Best company I've worked at, ever",Less than a year,0,"I could easily write an extremely long list of what makes me so happy to work at Braintree, but in the interest of your time, here are the highlights:

- The people - I really enjoy the company of my colleagues - like, each and every one of them is a great person and fun to be around.
- Hiring - Braintree's interviews are unlike normal tech interviews. Much more emphasis is put on communication skills and personal integrity. Since we pair on interviews, devs start interviewing candidates soon after they start. (To give you an example, I interviewed my first candidate a month after I started at Braintree).
- Pairing - We pair around 80-90% of the time, and pairs switch fairly often. Because of this, I have improved far more as a developer in the months I've been here than in any other role.
- Importance - The code I write is responsible for handling billions of dollars.
- Polyglot culture - Sharing context is encouraged. It's not unusual for an iOS dev to be working on the Python client library.
- Open dev day - Like 20% time, but for the whole day every other Friday. Great for working on open source.","- Braintree doesn't prioritize open source work as highly as one might want - priority is given to building new features (although this is changing).
- (At least in the Bay Area) Stripe dominates PR and developer mindshare in the payments space, not as many people know of Braintree.","No complaints here.
