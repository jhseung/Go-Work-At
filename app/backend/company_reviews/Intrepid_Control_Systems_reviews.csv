2017-04-17, Software Development Engineer ,"Madison Heights, MI",Former Intern ,Great company,Great company,0,Intrepid is a great company with great people and they really know how to make you feel like family. It is a great opportunity for the curious and there are many training sessions that employees can attend.,"Perhaps it was just my experience, or maybe it was just me, or perhaps it was a lack of curiosity, but I found that there was little direction or pressure on me as an intern to really accomplish anything.","My advice would simply be to maybe come up with a more structured plan for longer term interns. Possibly even have a weekly report session to the intern's supervisor. This way, not only do the interns get more professional communications practice, but those that are perhaps a bit directionless will have a stronger sense of direction instilled.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

2015-06-05, Software Engineer Intern,"Madison Heights, MI",Former Intern ,Good experience,Good experience,0,"The place is very relaxed and laid back. As an intern they understand you have school responsibility and they allow you to work at your own pace. However if you ask for a review they will tell you whether your pace is slow or fast. So you have to be self-managing. Don't expect someone to tell you what or how to do. You could actually sit for weeks without having a project in hand if you do not step up and ask for one.
The people that work there are extremely nice and laid back, also hard working.","Because it is very self managing, you could sit for weeks without having a project in your hand. And once you finish the project don't expect a feedback unless you ask them multiple times. Also it is a small company with 15-20 employees so I can not see a personal career growth.",,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0
