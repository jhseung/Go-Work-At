2017-02-22,,,Current Employee ,Energetic,Energetic,0,"Automated Business Designs offers their employees full benefits including health, 401K, vacation / personal time. Benefits are paid and the 401K plan is well thought out and quite unique to the advantage of the employee.
The environment is one where everyone does get to know each other and on a daily basis you get to work with other individuals in the office.
You are never bored. All positions within the organization provide new challenges every day whether it be writing or learning a new piece of the software, working with a new client, or just trying to solve the ""now how did that happen?"" or ""how do I do that"" questions of the day.
It is a team atmosphere where you are really never alone. When help is needed the support of the whole office is there to assist.
Special events happen all the time in the office to break up the day/week even if only for 15-30 minutes.","Cons are how you look at them.
If you are someone who says this is the way I do it, then this is not the place for you. Group decisions / recommendations / advice from everyone are all part of this company.
If you are someone who is not self-motivated or a self-starter, needs someone to plan your day for you, then this is not the place for you. You need to know how to keep yourself going and know when you need to put the time in even if it is beyond office hours.",,5.0,,,,,
