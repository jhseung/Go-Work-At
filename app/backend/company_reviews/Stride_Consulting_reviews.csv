- There is not a lot of pressure put on you by management to work overtime, good ""work-life balance.""
- There is a decent amount of transparency from leadership.
- If you are a software developer, there is a lot of room to learn and grow - Stride prepares you to be VERY marketable when you decide to look for a new job.","In order to attract talent and new business, Stride seeks to parallel product companies by boasting a strong culture, values, as well as a diverse and cohesive workforce. However, being a consultancy that sends its employees to client offices to work, Stride struggles to practice what they preach in regards to strong company culture.

Employees often identify more as an employee of the client than of Stride, or, conversely, Stride employees can feel isolated at a client since they aren't always able to fully participate in company culture and activities that the client offers.

For such a small, ""flat"" organization - it takes a long time for change to happen. This is because management is always focused on landing new clients and ensuring current clients are happy.
This makes getting a promotion, raise, or training very difficult at times as it is always de-prioritized in order to deal with client issues. Of course,this is not an easy issue to fix and has a lot to do with Stride's business model.

Stride is a difficult place to work if you are NOT a software developer as there is very little room to grow and there is little support for you. It is difficult for leadership to understand your value if you are not billing at a client and directly making Stride money. For this reason, employees who work at HQ are under pressure constantly to prove their worth. Because management is focused on clients, employees who work at HQ don't get the mentorship or support they need .","Leadership needs to better understand that proper training, salaries and other investments in their employees is key to growth and success long term. Stride will never please their clients if they fail to ensure their employees are equipped and properly motivated .",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

2017-04-06, Software Engineer,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,A truly unique place to work,A truly unique place to work,0,"Stride is, without a doubt, the most unique place I have ever worked. There are a lot of things that make Stride an amazing place to work but I will just touch on a couple of them.

The first thing that really strikes me about Stride is the support that you feel from the leadership team. I feel that leadership understands my personal goals and is dedicated to helping me achieve them. And the side-effect of an amazingly supportive leadership team is a culture of support that permeates through the whole Stride team.

Stride is the first company I have worked for where the core values actually mean something. The values don't merely exist as text on a page, they are substantive and no material decision is made without consulting our core values.

As an example, one of our core values is to learn from failure. Of course, in order to learn from failure, you first must fail. The leadership team actively encourages you to become better by stretching your skills (both as a consultant and as an engineer), even if that means failing along the way. Practically, this means there are few (if any) bounds to personal and professional development.

I could go on with reasons that Stride is a special places (including great benefits, flexibility, etc.) but I will leave it with the above.","Because we co-locate with clients, you don't get to spend as much time with fellow Striders as you might like.","Continue to be selective with hiring. Part of what makes Stride so unique is that team members of extremely skilled engineers, but they are also just awesome people.

Also, Stride has a very strong reputation continue to",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Caring and nurturing environment that is helping me learn and grow. As a female developer, I feel really comfortable at Stride and at my client. I used to have a fear of public speaking but now really enjoy leading client retrospectives and speaking at meetings.

Meetings are actually interesting and productive (I did not think it was possible but it is).

Professional development and content generation time.

Company is very transparent and my input is valued (even though I'm pretty junior).

Great work/life balance with fun monthly socials.

Really great people.","Challenging to get a job with little experience.

Only working with a few fellow Striders at a time on a client.","Try to figure out how to grow our teams at clients so we get to work with more Striders.

2016-09-08, Software Developer,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Software Developer,Software Developer,0,"Being a developer here is great. The VP of engineering does a really good job of championing us at the leadership level so management doesn't make our jobs suck. Management is also very dev friendly. Clients are screened heavily and lots of business gets turned down because devs don't want to work on those projects. The vacation policy is really good, hours are flexible, and pressure is low. The VP of engineering will come by and prod you to go home if you stay late. Everyone's smart and friendly. Pairing and TDD are the norm, and the company is big on being agile (XP and scrum mostly) so you don't end up with the problems a lot of more old school companies face. You can roll off projects when you get bored of them and work on new stuff periodically, in fact you are encouraged to do so. And if you have a serious problem with a client (code of conduct stuff), you can roll off immediately no questions asked. Compensation is competitive and promotions come with meaningful raises. You can get nominated for promotion by anyone (yourself, the client, your peers, your managers, your mom, whatever), and even if you don't get nominated you're automatically reviewed annually. The company is small enough that you can go ask the CEO for stuff and it's not weird. She's also super friendly. Oh, and we get 10 hours a month of investment time where you're paid to work on your own side projects, blog, learn stuff, whatever you want so long as you're investing in your skills or the company in some way.","You're doing client service, so if you don't do well in social situations (and many CS folks don't) it's better to work at a product company. You're not just coding, you're also consulting, which means you're expected to guide the client toward good processes, which is more about people skills than software skills. You're also held to a higher standard than the clients' own employees because you're more expensive and are supposed to be an outside expert. Mid-level devs at Stride usually have the experience of the senior devs at the client. You have to hit a higher bar here which may mean taking a lower title when you join (although thankfully not a pay cut).","Improve your brand recognition among developers.
