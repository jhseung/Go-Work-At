Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome.","You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you.",More on-boarding training before new employees are thrown in the fire.

2018.2.23, Software Development Manager,"Phoenix, AZ",Current Employee ,An Amazing Place to Work,Less than a year,0,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",,5,4,5,5,5,5
2016.2.20, Senior Engineering Manager,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,"Exciting Work, Abusive Culture",More than 8 years,0,"Jeff Bezos and his ""S-Team"" are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for long-term growth.

You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things. The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring. I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment.""","The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager. I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated. You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.","Don't pretend that the recent NY Times article was all about ""isolated incidents"". The culture IS abusive and it WILL backfire once stock value starts to drop. I'm an 8 year veteran and I no longer recommend former peers to interview with Amazon.",3,3,3,3,4,4
2013.12.17, Software Development Manager,"Seattle, WA",Current Employee ,"Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others",More than 3 years,0,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.","Stack ranking is a horrible practice since it's rife with favoritism. It's also not Amazonian in that it's not data based (arbitrarily designating a certain percentage of employees that must be put on performance management isn't a data driven criterion) and it's not frugal (effectively forcing an individual out of the company in one division who would make the grade in another is either retaining someone who doesn't meet the bar or a waste of talent). The goal is to force managers to actually make the hard decisions about how their team members compare with each other (not everyone can be exceptional), but it has more defects than virtues. Replace it with a common comparison of each person against the bar for their position, based on data. The percentages that are assigned to each performance category will turn out how they turn out, but there will be an evaluation mechanism that's fair and frugal.",4,3,3,5,5,4
2017.3.23,,"Seattle, WA",Former Employee ,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,More than 5 years,0,This company gets A list performance from C list employees. The culture is quick and hard charging. You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey. This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon. The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism. Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.","Bezos you bought the Washington Post and hired Jay Carney to be your PR head. There is nothing I can write here that you would deign listen to, because you are a hack. You must be mad that Expedia beat you to the punch and hired Chelsea Clinton to serve on their board of directors.

For those grasping Weasels that have squirmed and back stabbed your way to success, you know who you are. You won't care what is written here because ""You got yours, Eff them.""

For those truly diligent and hard working employees that don't want to believe the story from NY times that called Amazon a ""Snake Pit"" because you don't want to think you actually are involved in such a dystopian landscape of anti-business ethics: ""Always yell with the crowd. It is the only means to be safe.""",4,2,2,1,5,1

In addition, the organization is less favorable to women, particularly the AMZL, LMT and AGL organizations.","AMZL, LMT and AGL should reassess several of its Directors and clean house by ridding the organizations of the Directors that are abusive to employees and creating great churn in the organizations.

-","- 15 minute breaks for a 4 hour shift.
- Workload can vary depending on the day.

I work with people of all ethnicities from the entire globe and it makes work so much more interesting and rich. I love how laid back Amazonians are.

2019.3.19, Senior Technical Program Manager,"Pittsburgh, PA",Current Employee ,Excited about the opportunities,Less than a year,0,"One thing to call out is that as Amazon is a large company, your experiences will vary based on your team. I have largely only had positive experiences and am very happy I made the transition to work at Amazon. Some of the pros I've experiences:
- I am constantly challenged by incredibly smart and hard-working individuals, the culture embraces learning new things and stretching yourself
- I've been given significant responsibility and the ability to make meaningful impact almost immediately
- Compared to more traditional companies, there is no red tape. If you have a good idea, just make it happen. Individuals at all levels are empowered to do what they think is best. You don't have to have 5 managers approve something for you to get your work done.
- Work-life balance is incredibly important. Almost everyone on my team has kids and they all value your evenings and weekend time. Members of my team have gotten dinged for working on the weekend. And it's very understandable if you need to work from home (even suddenly if something comes up with your kids)","- There isn't much sharing across teams in the company. I find out about what other teams are doing in the public news.
- While benefits are very good compared to most companies, we're behind other tech companies. Having some support for childcare would be appreciated and make a difference.","Try to keep the culture consistently focused on the Leadership Principles, it's a great place to work.",5,5,5,5,4,5
2019.3.22, Inbound Stow,"Sacramento, CA",Former Employee ,"Gets a lot of hate, bet better than most.",More than a year,0,"Amazon is not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure some sites have had issues (as seen on the news) but the site I worked at was alright. I was given two 15 min breaks and a 30 min lunch for 10-hour shifts and three 15 min breaks and lunch for 12 hours.
I never had issues using the restroom or getting water either. Most sites are on 4 day-10 hours per day schedule

Some big Pros:
1. Full Benefits Day 1
  1a. A total of 168 hours of time off options each year
   80 hours of unpaid time off, 20 hours each quarter
   48 hours of paid time off, earned based on hours worked
   40 hours of paid vacation, earned based on hours worked.
   Plus during non-busy times you can opt to go home without pay for no penalty
   I feel this is a generous amount and the most I heard of for new employees.
2. $15 Per Hour (Recently Raised)
3. Daily food trucks arranged (This was at my site, others may vary)
4. Once a month or so they would buy lunch (pizza, Chik-fil-a, etc) for everyone
5. Peak Season (Nov-Dec) prizes, awards for attendance, and performance
6. Climate controlled 81 degrees max in the summer, 50-70 in the winter
7. Communicated overtime in advance of at least 24 hours
    7a. At most, you worked 5 days a week if needed.

Warehouse work is not for everyone, I have worked in several warehouses Amazon has some pretty easy positions. Most of the time boring, standing in one place but easy.
There are performance and quality rates to maintain, some people struggle, and some people excel. It is fairly easy to maintain these rates at a steady pace. This pretty much sums it all up.","Couple downsides, however, you will find this with most warehouses.
1. Despite the nationwide pay increase to $15 still low for how successful Amazon is.
2. Poor management, some better than others though.
3. Drama, even with some of the management. (This is typical with most companies)
4. Slow pay raise scale.
5. You are still a number.",,4,5,4,4,5,3

2019.3.11, Senior Software Development Engineer,"Hampton, VA",Current Employee ,Working at Amazon is What You Make It,More than 5 years,0,"* Amazon always focuses on the customer first, and in doing such, you feel connected with the people that use your products.
* Many of the products we work on are at the forefront of the industry, whether it be cloud services, retail, physical shopping, devices, etc.
* There's always something new to learn and there is a mixture of all kinds of roles from more scientific and research based to hard core system optimization as well as solving new and interesting business problems, so whatever problems you like to solve, Amazon likely has something in that realm.
* You are allowed to move between teams pretty much as often as you like. If you end up with a bad manager or unreasonable work pace, you can work with HR to find something more your speed.
* Amazon compensates employees in stock, and the stock has been doing amazing the past 5 years.
* Amazon is very flexible with dedicated and long-time employees. My wife got a job that required us to move across the country, and so I was able to start working from home (after 5 years at Amazon) while flying back to visit the main office in Seattle once a month or so.
* The company operates as thousands of tiny little start ups. Each team has it's own set of goals and goes through rapid iterative development cycles, which makes for a fun environment. The advantage of being in a giant company like Amazon in this situation is that you can then leverage many of the tools and services that others have built and vend to you to make this even faster!","* Churn of people moving teams and in and out of company make it a little difficult to persist knowledge and keep full team momentum moving forward, but you can find teams that stick together for quite some time as well, it just depends.
* Compensation is good compared to the software industry as a whole, but compared to other tech companies, it is slightly behind. Compensation is definitely substantial and had me very quickly walk away from a different employer I was not planning on leaving and keep me hear for 6+ years, so it's definitely still pretty good.","* Keep it up. You have created a company that is not risk adverse and loves taking on a challenge.

2019.3.5, Area Manager,,Current Employee ,"Not for everyone, but absolutely great.",More than 3 years,0,"The jobs is challenging, but extremely rewarding. The Area Manager role is a very busy job, but with a lot of opportunity.

You will always have a challenge ahead of you, and will never run out of work to complete. Due to the growth of the company, you will have unlimited growth potential, and Amazon is very open to moving you to any role as long as your talents match the position. The pay is very competitive, although it seems to be getting lower and lower every year.

If you love work, and you love thinking about what is possible with any process or issue, this is absolutely the job for you. Look no further. If you can imagine it, and can provide the data to sell it, you can do it.

I never imagined I would love operations and logistics, but I really enjoy my job. Those of us that are good enough to weed out all the things that aren't value added will have a great time here.","Work-life balance can often take a significant turn to the negative, specifically during holiday seasons. Operations seems to be the main place this occurs; yet, support program managers and other corporate entities are paid more than operations management, regardless of the extra work and direct-to-customer facing role.

Even so, the biggest drawback of the job in the operations are all the petty, near-worthless duties you will have mostly due to HR policies. Let me be clear: an Area Manager is likely the busiest role in the company. You will have a lot to do, and not enough time to do it. Throughout this, you will receive a high amount of duties that I would consider short-term thinking, not matching the culture that Amazon has created; and most of it is due to HR policies. You will have to enter reports and checkmarks of things HR wants you to do that frankly make no difference in the long term at all. This wouldn't be an issue in itself, but an Area Manager has a significant amount of work to do, and these petty things add zero value to the work, and ZERO value to the associate experience.

The company should really examine how much work the Area Manager role is being given, as it is always more and more, and a lot of it it useless. The role would be more useful if this was scrutinized.","I would suggest to revise what you want an Area Manager to do. Every month there seems to be more added, with nothing being taken away. The workload isn't the problem here, but the amount of things that don't add value to the customer or the organization. The role is becoming more trivial than ever after 3 years of seeing it develop.",5,3,5,5,5,5
