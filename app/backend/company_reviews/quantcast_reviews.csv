2019-01-29,,,Current Employee ,Startup with an Exciting Future,More than 3 years,0,"Quantcast has awesome perks. Catered lunches and snacks, great happy hours, and culturally oriented events define a dynamic and fun culture. My colleagues are one of the more educated groups I've seen in the industry. I work with Ph.D. and Masters graduates from top tier universities. Even better, instead of relegating these folks to a research role, Quantcast leverages them to be part of releasing production software.

The newly devised business strategy is compelling. With the recent change to leadership, in addition to getting back to our technical roots, we are making consumer-facing software endeavors that could remake the way publishers and marketers monetize their content on the internet.

Quantcast is a place for gifted computer scientists to make a significant impact on exciting products. It's also a place where building software that non-technical end-users use. In short, it's a place where individuals can leverage their strengths to enhance a developing product suite.","As with any company that's growing and building new products, there can be substantial uncertainty.

CEO is selfish guy, doesn't want to sell the company or show an exit. I can also understand, it's very hard for anyone to sell/exit it's own baby/company. So, Konrad is not the right guy, he is too attached to the company to show any exit for the company. He needs to step down, have the new CEO show the path to the exit. Lot of companies in the valley do that usually, especially founders take the side role and new person take company to IPO, it's less pressure/burden on the founder as well.","Konrad needs to step down, have someone else take over and show company exit.",2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

You are not seen as a team player if you don't go along with this type of behavior and thus become a target. Management is the root of this issue and it comes from the top down. Every year there is a new reorg or beta team setup that they claim is going to fix all of the issues, but these reorgs are led by the same people who made the decisions before and therefore will never fix the fundamental problems. The field west sales team is the worst of it and the teams around them suffer because of their behavior. Management duplicates work several times over by creating Gdocs and various trackers because they are so incapable of using their own management tools. They lay off their highest performing team members in reorgs, and those who generate the most valuable work are not rewarded or recognized for their contributions. If you see a high volume of job postings, it's because of the constant turnover. I would highly recommend staying away from working here.",Stop allowing these unethical business practices.

Quantcast has made significant strides across diversity and inclusion. They take this very seriously and I’m hopeful they continue on this course.

The leadership team has taken thoughtful steps to addressing transparency and accountability. They address hard questions and they are all accessible and will stop and work through any problem with you.

Career development here is a real thing. I’ve seen many people grow to take consequential leadership positions at the company and we consistently receive the support we need to continue developing as professionals and leaders.

- The impact, scope of problems and type of challenges you get exposed to are pretty unparalleled across the industry. You work on the same category of problems the top 1% at Google work on.
- You have a lot of freedom to work on the problems you like, and engineering managers are asked to not assign people to projects they dislike, or won't make them grow
- Quantcast invests in engineer's growth. The management culture here is such that projects and services push people out of their comfort zone so they can learn. Company compensates for workshops, seminars and training material
- Work life balance is pretty great. Working from home is pretty common, and there's never pressure towards working over time.
- Steady revenue; company has been profitable without raising capital since forever

I.e. even if you are at the top tier of performers, you will NOT get promoted OR get a raise. As a result, many of these high performers end up leaving.
- Company goals are constantly getting reworked. There is also no transparency into who is actually deciding what direction the company is going in. Projects that you'll start working on in the beginning of the year will get completely halted, and you'll have to pivot. This happens about 4-5x a year (and that's being generous).

Middle Management is laughable. They have no experience and are given no training to be successful in the role. If you are unlucky and have a manager who cares more about their personal agenda and advancement, you will soon be fired or blamed for any mistake that happens. Or they will just take credit for your work.

Finger pointing and blaming others happens constantly and is not looked to be a negative for managers. Instead of working together on a common goal, you will find the excuse ""that's not part of my responsibilities"", and then play the blame game on teammates all day long.

- It's a wonder how they manage to get employees to trust in their vision. The company mission was not easy to visualize. Not many people seem to understand.

- As an engineer, it is unlikely that you will learn hottest skillsets of the time. Quantcast does some machine learning but it is not the AI powerhouse as some reviewers call it. Nor is it the best company to learn distributed systems. They say ""big data"" but it's not that hot (or hard) anymore.

- Because of the above, the breadth and depth of your skillset can vary depending on your team. Some people get in as very good engineers and leave as bad engineers. It's hard to translate the skills you use at Quantcast to those required by other companies, and even if you get lucky, it's even more difficult to be the most sought-after assets. If you want to do cool things, you must be at companies working on the hottest problems. If you want to build core skillsets, you must be at companies with a variety of learning opportunities. Quantcast is not the strongest in either one of those.

- Work is all politics. Engineers (especially ML engineers) do nothing interesting due to bottlenecks from office politics and favoritism by managers

- Some managers don't care about wellbeing of their subordinates. They want to feel powerful and that's why they stay. Some of them are new and are not trained well. Some of them don't have people skills. Some simply follow the books and don't know how to manage people. Good ones who care either become one of those bad ones, or leave early.

- Programmatic advertising (imho) passed its peak and hence almost no upward potential for your career from company growth. So don't expect to grow as the company scales; if you imagine Airbnb, the chances are you are wrong.

- Some products have rooms to improve and it's possible to do better. But no one wants to speak up because telling the truth will make people angry. The culture is set in such a way that any critical thinking on their product is not welcome. Flatter may not help the company, but it will help you.

- On the same line as above, if you still want to join, you must pretend problems don't exist so that the management, 30000 feet above the ground, wouldn't notice it. If you care too much, you won't do well at Quantcast. If managers can't feel good about themselves because you question them, they will blame you for everything that is or is not an issue.

- Every moment of post-mortem is a grilling session. For those who don't know what post-mortem is, it's a meeting in which people should go over any past issues (e.g. server failures). Some managers at Quantcast use it to blame engineers who work for other managers they don't get along with. Being good at blaming and embarrassing engineers is a must.

- Fraternity culture. Heavy drinking, heavy hangout. If you enjoy it, this can be an advantage. But remember that give or take exceptions, post-work drinking somewhat relates to your ""performance"" - it happens in many places and Quantcast doesn't look like an exception. You have to get in the right group otherwise your life can be hard. Well, same is true for many other companies. Quantcast is one of them that doesn't address the problem correctly.

- Favoritism is conspicuous. And it hurts. Won't get into much details here because it can feel serious. Just know that it can hurt your feelings and trigger you to leave. Enough said on this.

- The performance review is scheduled so that your politics is rewarded at least as much as results. Regardless of how much results you deliver, you will not be promoted unless managers approve your ""sphere of influence"". Easy to write down but implemented differently at every company. Quantcast seems to use this principle very politically and consequently wrong people get promoted while good people leave.

- The company celebrates meetings. More time is spent on meetings than doing work. There were a sizable number of people who start the conversation by ""let's schedule a meeting"", or ""let's meet to prepare for the standup"". There were meetings, and pre-meetings, and meetings for meetings. And of course, how often you schedule meetings is one way to measure your influence.

- Meetings might look bad for engineers who need to focus, but since there's not much engineering to the product, selling (yes, selling) your product to non-engineers (e.g. ops, sales) takes higher priority. So if you like selling your product to people at your own company, this may not be that bad. Some people love it, and their perspectives should be respected as well.

- Middle management doesn't want to address issues in their technology in fear of exposing themselves to blame. It is possible to wonder if the management would rather have engineers sit around than do something. This is probably due to lack of trust in their culture.

- Couple of managers love to show off their power. These people have been at Quantcast for a very long time and contributed to building their culture. They can be really rude if they feel their authorities are challenged. If you can hurt your self-esteem by having your manager being extremely rude to you, make sure you get a good person to manage you. Some people (as in many other places in the world) go to work to simply ""feel powerful"".

- They don't pay well. They can tell candidates to take a paycut to work at Quantcast because everyone is getting paid less for ""amazing work"". You can guess how wonderful the work environment would be at a company that doesn't want to ""invest"" in you. Do extensive cost-benefit analysis on whether the ""awesome work"" at Quantcast is worth your paycut.

- Too many layers of management. Due to the intense office politics across the company and the kind of people it attracts, lots of engineers want to shift to management. The company promotes them to keep them, who are then coached by existing (toxic) managers.","Pay attention to employees. You are too detached and you care less about your team than you think you do. Some people are good, but few are toxic. Many of these toxic people are powerful enough to form your culture. Many people join your company as new grads, learn very little, and leave with narrow world views after a few years at Quantcast. If you pay attention and offer them opportunities to experience more, they will grow more. Employees are not a disposable asset.

If you have a strong, well-respected manager who has been with the company for years, they will fight for your promotions and compensation increases, manage up into sales leadership. If you have a weak manager, they will sell you down the river to save their job and you can forget about getting a promotion. I have been lied to multiple times by my manager. Promotion cycles are all about which manager can yell the loudest and beat their chests the hardest making ""calibration meetings"" nothing more than ego trips for sales managers trying to promote themselves. Poor managers are making employees leave in droves. There are unprofessional managers who have said/done things that they should be fired for and nothing was done.

New executive sales management. The country club of ad sales executives arrived 6-9 months ago. Veteran group and well-connected in the ad world. But, the lack of knowledge they have about Quantcast is alarming. Some well-respected sales leaders have been pushed out.

Re-orgs. Quantcast is obsessed with reorganizing their teams and pretending that nothing happened.

Automates everything which ends up breaking things. Quantcast has a habit of trying to automate systems that are half-baked by its engineering teams. The result is a suboptimal internal product that ends up hurting the business.

Sales training is a mixed bag.","Start cleaning house in the middle management group. External manager hires have been poor and have lost employees and their trust.

Compared to other companies I've worked for, the people here stand out as being especially smart, kind, and motivated to help the company succeed. Since arriving at QC, I've felt empowered as an individual contributor to notice a problem and take on a project to fix it. Personally, I've observed that taking initiative like this is applauded and generally rewarded. This certainly does not happen 100% of the time but it is much more common than at the two other tech companies I've worked for.","The main criticism I have is that there can be a lot of disorganization on high level initiatives that seems to stem from poor communication at the mid-manager level. It seems that managers on various teams do not talk to each other enough and there ends up being overlapping work or poor execution due to a misunderstanding of how another team operates. It's frustrating to find yourself in the middle of this and discover some work you were doing is not going to be used because the manager wasn't doing their job.

Another strong criticism is that there is no 401k matching at all. I like Quantcast but refusing to provide any 401k matching just isn't classy. As another reviewer pointed out, Quantcast cannot claim to be on par with companies like Facebook and Google without this.",Expect more from middle managers. I have seen poor communication in middle management lead to so much inefficiency. Maybe resolving this and other inefficiencies will give you the financial wiggle room to finally provide the 401k matching that your employees are desperately requesting.,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

- Highly aspirational (wants to become the next Google or Facebook)","- Quantcast is going through major growing pains, including multiple reorgs that have caused instability in the customer facing orgs driven by new sales leadership, who all come to Quantcast because they know someone. They, in turn, bring their friends to fill senior roles without having much context in the industry.
- Products are constantly being released without being tested, causing tension between sales and product/engineering.
- Everyone is more than willing to point the finger at another team when something is wrong, instead of working together to fix it.
- Mediocrity is rewarded, especially for folks who are highly political. Middle management is really young, and many managers have no interest in learning the products or in learning to manage. It's easy to get away with doing the bare minimum.
- Despite all of Quantcast's boasting about being the next Facebook or Google, our benefits don't even include 401k matching.","Please think more about employee retention. Stop with the constant unexpected changes and reorgs, or think more about how to make people want to stay afterwards. Instead of thinking only about the bottom line, think about how decisions will affect employees and customers. Lots of roles feel like a dead end; really try to invest in helping people move to the next phase of their career. Promote internally instead of hiring outside managers who don't understand the business nor care to learn. Stop hiring old school sales leaders who hire their friends, and stop celebrating mediocre people. Quantcast has felt a lot less like a meritocracy the longer I have been here. Cut loose dead weight, including managers and employees who cannot meet the requirements for their jobs. Hire compassionate leaders, who will advocate for employees and lead them through building trust versus fear. Hold managers responsible for low employee retention and/or low reviews. Create a culture where people feel accountable instead of shifting blame to others. Hire more female engineers. Create feedback channels for products.

Quantcast reinforces this by investing a lot into employee happiness (happy hours, catered meals, corporate outings, team building, onboarding events, etc.) and upper management seems to genuinely care that everyone feels like they are a part of the team and helping to build something great.

As an example, the CEO still takes time to personally talk to all new hires, which is crazy for a 800+ employee, global company.

Teammates - depending on which team you're on, you can spend your entire day working with brilliant, friendly people.

The product - people at Quantcast joke that we all drank the Kool-Aid when we started, but we really do have an excellent product, and people at QC are genuinely excited about maintaining the quality of what we sell.

Collaboration - QC has very little in the way of office politics. There will always be some, but the vast majority of people here have no interest in manipulating or stabbing you in the back in order to get ahead. We're all working towards the same goal, and most people you interact with will be highly supportive of you.","The re-org - it's been mentioned in other reviews, but there was recently a re-org of the entire sales/client operations side of the business, and it's gone terribly. There's a lot of bitterness and a lot of attrition, particularly from top performers.

Attrition - in general, people stay at Quantcast an average of about two years, which means that we tend to cycle behaviors every two years as well, since nobody is around to remind us that we already tried something and either failed/didn't like it.

Middle management - having a good manager can make or break your career at Quantcast. If you have a good manager, they will look out for your career growth, advocate for you, and help you find your passions. If you have a bad manager, you will have no idea how you're doing until you hit annual review, at which point it will be too late for you to make any changes that can affect your chances of a promotion or raise.

Money - we're underpaid. The fact that we have catered food helps soften it, though.

Workload - we're trying to scale while keeping headcount low, which means that everybody is stretched thin while we figure out how to become more efficient. This will probably last a while.","Continue making IC tracks for people who get bad reviews as managers - they're valuable, but being good at their jobs doesn't make those people good managers.

For the love of god, please stop re-organizing the sales/client ops teams. Or, at the very least, survey employees about why they disliked the re-org, and make sure to apply that feedback to any future organizational changes.

Fun happy hours.","The engineering culture seemed reminiscent of the much debated culture of amazon, in which everyone down to the individual contributor level must take responsibility of development work, QA, hiring, product management, client support, requirement gathering, and prioritization of multiple projects. It felt like the engineers were stretched far too thin which in turn created not only bad products but large waves of attrition.

Also, they seem to have difficulty with appropriate resource allocation, in that they assign people to projects that don't cater to their strengths or approve teams who insist on spending their work hours building and supporting crazy things outside the scope of adTech (think Atlassian products...). The lack of organization between product, client support, and engineering made it very hard to get anything done here.

We under-communicate, both across departments and vertically. The channels to communicate aren't defined along as are the expectations as to who should be communicating.

The interview process was absurd - throughout they will compare themselves to Google and after a gauntlet of phone interviews, they will bring you in for a 4-6 hour day interview where you will meet with at least 4-6 different people.

The technical challenges are considerable. There are a lot of tricky problems to solve here. This is very cool.

The management is clearly trying to build a long-running concern (not a pump-and-dump startup), with constant attention to continually improving how they do business. The management appears genuinely concerned about providing ongoing career growth (and rewarding it). This is a more ""grown-up"" start up than many: with much of the playfulness, but less of the actual insanity I've noted so much of elsewhere.

I love the catered lunch--not just for the nutritious, mostly yummy food, but for the easy opportunity to socialize with clever, funny, friendly people.","The growing population of employees means you may need to wait for the bathroom. ;)

The usual growing pains associated with a start-up, including hiccups when balancing cost-control and expansion, or when scaling organizational structures as the company grows. I do think we're mostly doing a good job here.

Sometimes the workload is a bit much (see: ""start-up""), but we are trying to hire....

There could be more transparency about the organizational structure. It can be hard to figure out what group works on what and where to find them.

2018-02-16, Sales,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",Current Employee ,Great Dublin tech company,More than 3 years,0,"I've been with Quantcast for a number of years now and have had a great time working at the company. Having come from much larger organisations, it's been great to see the company grow over this time. Given where the company is at in terms of it's long term strategy and potential IPO, there's obviously challenges along the way but in my experience, that comes with every company no matter the size.
Pros:
Culture - the Dublin culture is 2nd to none and has often been called out by the company as a model to follow. Everyday I get to work with extremely smart, ambitious people who are all pushing for the same goal - no politics here which is great
Product - for any working in advertising, digital or otherwise, you'll get the chance to work on a solution that really does provide value to our customers and compete with the likes of Facebook & Google.
Development - I've had the chance to personally develop both from a skills and career perspective here, and also see others on various teams progress into more senior roles, with some moving into management. I genuinely believe that the things you'll learn here are difficult to come by elsewhere and will stand to anyones long term career.
Benefits - all the standard benefits or working with a Dublin tech company are here, with a regular Friday beer cart always great to bring the teams together.","Like any company our size and aiming for significant growth and IPO, change is an inevitable part of the job. We've seen some shifts in the organisational structure and in executive leadership, all of which will accelerate our growth. In particular new senior hires at CMO & COO level are massive for us.",Execute on the vision and strategy that has been laid out.

Dublin (Ireland)",Current Employee ,No Room For Growth,,0,"Free food, young atmosphere, flexible paid time off, flexible working from home, average industry pay, central and clean Dublin office",Constant change.

Or you will continue to lose good employees,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0
2018-02-12,,,Former Employee ,Great people on the ground - incompetent exec leadership,Less than a year,0,"The people you get to work with are in general very friendly, welcoming and generous of their time. There is a base of very talented people.

Excellent relationships with clients and some agencies.

Nicely located offices around the world. Never in the dodgy outskirts, always in the centre near the media agencies and other tech companies.

A good technology base to build from.","1/ Terrible exec leadership.
CEO is struggling with the job, focusing on details and flying relentlessly for quick local fixes instead of looking at the big picture. The CEO hasn't built a vision of the company and has failed to define what Quantcast should stand for, leaving space for infighting within his team and flavor-of-the-moment company statements. Impossible to rally behind. Every major decision (hires, restructures, investments) has been bad.
SVP of engineering: promotes a very negative culture and no partnership with the Product team. A massive issue for a tech company. Suffocates innovation from junior team members and more senior alike if it doesn't go with what he is thinking.
SVP of Product: very bright but not a product org leader. The quality of the product team and the lack of products (not features) is a testament of that. Needs to build products for the market and abandon the things that none wants.
CMO: chief of buzzwords and no action. A lot of talk, a lot of selfies, a change of colours and logos, shooting ambulances to build his brand, but what is the effect for Quantcast? Where are the positive business outcomes? 90% of his team has churned in less than 6 months. Staff giggles when he is talking at the all hands.

2/ Product not up to scratch
Advertising: Falling behind the competition in terms of results for clients, budget share, consideration and features. Failed to take the mobile turn.
Measurement: will struggle as Google Analytics ups its game and the DMPs become simpler. Will end up being a quick fix solution for small, spammy websites.
Data: the cornerstone of Quantcast's position is that it sees users hundred's of times of month. But according to the internal analysts, this is a lie. And more stringent privacy laws around the world + tracking blocks will put an end to this.

3/ Vision
Where is it?

4/ Spirit
Most employees are looking around.
None challenges the leadership or senior management.
Employees internally are making fun of the leadership and the company positioning (the recent shift to AI was perceived as a farce and is the subject of endless memes)",All except the new COO (who I haven't worked with): please allow for a new and different set of leaders to come and save the company.,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

2018-02-07,,,Current Employee ,"Looks slick from the outside, but chaotic and frustrating in reality",More than 3 years,0,"Some nice people work here.

The tech was exciting back in 2014.

Free lunches.

Everyone got a free Amazon Echo to distract us from the reality of the situation.

Work life balance is good because most people no longer see the upside of overworking themselves when another restructure is on the horozon.","Redundancies & attrition - company performance is very poor, but to tackle this, they've decided to let a number of quality, experienced people go in all offices and departments. The brain drain at all levels and departments is severe. A lot of senior product, marketing, operations and engineering people have moved on and not been replaced.

Poor leadership - at all levels. From the CEO who has overseen every bad decision in recent years, to shockingly poor middle management. Management is only interested in managing up unfortunately. Very few people have been promoted from within and they are usually bad choices.

Salary and package is not competitive. The company does compete with Google/Facebook/LinkedIn for comparable roles. As a result, questionable hires are made as the truly great people go to those companies instead.

Game of Thrones (executive edition) - a fun game to play is to look at the leadership page on the UK site, and compare it to the leadership page on the US site. Oh look, there's a VP of Engineering on the UK site, but not the US site. That's another casualty in unending turnover in executive leadership. I love that they fire members of the leadership teams but forget to remove them from the international sites. There is constant turmoil at the top and this filters down in various manners of unpleasantness as the average workers deal with the fallout of yet another restructure initiated by a bruised ego.

Questionable positioning - oh hey, we're an ""AI"" company now. We were a programmatic/machine learning/RTB company over the past 10 years. Interesting that the new CMO shows up, throws his favourite marketing buzzwords into the mix and that's our direction now. Does no-one else see that the CMO is busier promoting himself instead of the company? A rebrand is the lowest of the low hanging fruit and an easy win for him.

Learning & Development - forget about it. There is nothing happening on that front. Unless you are very junior, you will learn nothing to add to your experience. All new experience and skills are hired externally. Be very careful about joining Quantcast as an experienced hire, unless you are excellent at political game playing.

Stagnant product - has not been updated in many years. The market has passed the company by and QC has done nothing to address concerns around transparency, pricing, margins, brand safety and also nothing in adapting product suitability for the markets in which it is sold. This is worse in EMEA than in the US.

Promotion process - it's painful. Too many times, good people are passed over and instead they promote the unqualified person that was friends with a manager in their old company. It ends up in a cross departmental political shouting match where managers from one department shout down the promotion choices of another department. Absolutely infuriating.

Workflows and restructures - daily workflow is not clear and changes all the time. Entire departments have been in a constant state of re-organisation for years so the goalposts are constantly shifting. This is not a stable company.

Changing the company focus - the old products may as well be dead as the focus of the company is shifting to something else. That means all remaining resources are working on this new vision and all the existing products are likely to stagnate further.","Where do you even start? The only sensible course of action is to place the current CEO in a figurehead role and employ a leader with a proven track record to bring this company to the next level. The employees that have toiled away for years deserve a chance at converting their moribund stock options into something valuable at some point.

Also - it has been said repeatedly, but there needs to be a true evaluation of learning requirements and budget should be required to upskilling the people that are worth retaining.

Finally, management at all levels requires evaluation. There are people in management who are embarrassingly lacking in skills, execution and vision. This has been the case for many years.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

A culture of favoritism leaving high performers feeling undervalued, creating a mediocre middle management and putting suck-ups on a pedestal.
Gender and racial diversity are absolutely terrible.
The company has been losing people in the last two years. Instead of addressing the problem, it keeps using re-orgs as the excuse for the high employees turnover.

Leadership
Each member of the leadership team is a parody of himself/herself: product who has not launched a single product in years, HR who is rude to the staff and loves gossiping, engineering who does not understand the technology, marketing who promotes only himself and talks in buzzwords.

2017-07-26, Corporate Sales,"Dublin, Co. Dublin (Ireland)",Former Employee ,Disappointing and toxic company,More than a year,0,"The Dublin office is very well located. It comes with the usual perks that you now see in high tech companies : flexible workspaces, breakfast and lunch, yoga classes...

The technology is very impressive and there is a lot to wow your customers. If you want to get into real time advertising, Quantcast is very advanced. However the strategy for growth renders the quality of the solution completely pointless.

The sales methodology and sales training is excellent. If only the sales team and the managers put that into real practice instead of just repeating the keywords like parrots!","Quantcast has a bad track record when it comes to managing people. I had seen negative reviews before I joined, and I heard negative feedback from my personal network including recruiting agencies. The team I interviewed with for sales convinced me it would be just fine. Little did I know that it was going to be such a mess.

Here's what I struggled with:
- Don't get fooled by the titles! A sales manager is in reality an account executive in charge of new business.
- Inexperienced managers who have never worked outside of Ireland but need to cover areas like DACH, Southern Europe or Israel and have no clue
- No territory policy : I ran a report in Salesforce which showed me that just before someone joins the company, the other AEs put the ""juicy"" accounts under their name and sit on them just by principle.
- This means that new people are not allocated a fair and relevant patch, and are left with either cold accounts or accounts with no budget.
- This also means that sales people are fighting for the same accounts and it fosters a culture of mistrust.
- Managers refuse to discuss the territory issues and will beat you on the head about your quotas even though you have a dry patch.
- If you join as an AE, you may eventually be promoted to senior AE, but after that it's limbo. Teams are too small to require more managers, and there is no career path to a field role.

Since I left, the SDR programme seems to have been scrapped. some markets have been closed down and a large number of people in leadership roles have left (voluntarily or not).

When it comes to people, everyone is smart and capable. But here's very little recognition from managers: they put more value on someone who's been in the company for 15 months than on someone who brings more sales experience. It's very difficult to change the way things are done, however hard the sales enablement team tries (and God knows they try and they're good).

Cases of bullying are frequent. Usually brushed under the carpet. It's particularly true in the local offices in continental Europe.

Commissions are not calculated on the amount of the deal you closed. They're calculated based on the budget invoiced to the customer and paid on a quarterly basis in the following quarter. EX: your Q1 commissions (Jan to March) will be paid in May. Bear that in mind.

HR is a joke with no insight into what people do, no exit interview for terminated contracts, and an apparent disregard for churn. They seem to live under the delusion that there are hundreds of candidates queuing at the door.","Wake up: your reputation in Dublin is horrible and everyone knows it. There are so many horror stories about Quantcast that not only will you lose employees but also clients. Clients read Glassdoor too.

Clarify what career evolutions are available or not and what are the criteria. Don't hide behind fake reasons.

Stop using the ""start up"" excuses. The company is 11 years old. Hire business people to take it out of the slump or sell it to the competition.

You have a wonderful technology and the best people at engineering, campaign analysis and CS levels. Make the sales organisation work properly and you'll improve all the KPIs.",1.0,,,,,

2012-03-15, Engineer,,Former Employee ,Okay place to work,,0,"1. Big engineering challenges
2. Smart engineering team
3. Coworkers are fun to work with","1. Not so competitive pay
2. Weird culture gap between rank&file employees and the management. If you are looking for a culture like lots of YC companies, don't bother
3. HR had done a terrible job in retaining talent. They are good at selling the company when recruiting, but doesn't care much once you are in. They tried to 'manufacture' a cool startup culture, but with the wrong mentality, it never really worked. Just ask them why most people on the photo which was taken when the company won the 'most innovative company' left, including the amazingly smart CTO.
4. Weak PM, sometimes I even wondered why we have a PM team.","You can always hire new guys, but without retaining good employees, the train will never go as fast as you wish",3.0,1.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,
2011-11-27, Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,good company with some issues,,0,"* First, please note that the recent burst of high ratings is due to internal recruiters asking employees to rate quantcast. That doesn't mean they're lying, but keep that in mind.
* coworkers are great and hiring standards are high
* if you're on the right team, you do legitimately work on big data / hadoop. None of the 16 node ""clusters"" that other companies claim; we use 1k+ node clusters on 100+ TB datasets.
* quantcast, as a company, is performing well
* the display ad space is growing and quantcast is on the cutting edge of the rtb market
* the ceo Konrad and the head of product Jag are very impressive people who do great work. In fact the majority of the employees are great at their jobs, but Konrad and Jag stand out.

so, should you work here?
* if you'll be working on hadoop jobs, probably: you'll get a great practical education in parallel computing and a great chit on your resume
* it depends on the team; make sure you aren't one of the people talking to salesforce or writing etl logic
* financially it won't make you rich even if quantcast goes public, but you may learn a lot more here on the right team","* what you work on and how good the job is can vary quite wildly by team. Our ops team is massively overworked and seems to burn out within 6 months and either quit or transfer, while other teams have great retention.
* some people do write massive hadoop jobs, but you might end up coding interface / workflow logic to interface with salesforce or an ad server. This is neither interesting nor exciting.
* It's fair to say there are very exciting and interesting technologies being built inside quantcast, but the important question is if you will be working on them.
* though it varies by team, it's fair to say that managers take little interest in career development of employees.
* someone below claimed stock options are generous. That's simply wrong. Engineers hired now will get a stock option package that pays out roughly $120k after taxes per billion dollars earned in a liquidity event if fully vested. Financially, you're probably better off going to Google. Upper management also seems to massively overestimate the value of stock options and we've had a ton of turnover of people who made quantcast a worse company for leaving.
* most importantly... more than 1/2 the company has quit in the last 16 months since our previous employee photo. Including the cto who is an amazing technologist. Management rarely discusses this with employees and doesn't seem to care to retain people. This is worst in the engineering department through true across the company. To quantcast's credit, when engineers quit I was almost always really sad to see the person leave. The majority were definitely not bad hires. Plus, with our internal hadoop variant there is an enormous learning curve for engineers and it really hurts when people who understand all the internal systems keep leaving.
* the only direct effort to increase retainment is by moving salary to bonus and not paying it out until late April so that if an employee leaves before then he or she effectively forfeits 10% of his or her salary for the previous year.","* Figure out why good employees keep leaving and fix some of the issues.
* Take an interest in employee career development. If an employee's manager can't name what an employee wants to do in his or her career and isn't figuring out how to help that person get there the manager isn't doing his or her job.",3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.5,
