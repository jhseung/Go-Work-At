Management asks if you have health insurance through the company when you call in sick.

Very much business minded and is not as focused on patient care as they once were or about making their employees happy.
Does not actually adhere to their vision and values.
Honestly think there is money mismanagement since they essentially shut down most services for a hospital in a community where both hospitals were being fully utilized by the community.
They cut the scrub stipend from $75 to $50.
Policy states there is a weekend differential for all clinical employees (includes techs) Centura wide, but it is not given or even offered.

All hospitals are understaffed. Nurses can end up with 6-7 patients on night shift including charge.
No overtime has been allowed for a few months which doesn’t help being understaffed.
No sick bank, you only have a PTO bank for when you’re sick.
PTO doesn’t actually accrue if you’re called off all the time, because bills still need paid.
Only a 1% pay raise with 2% CoLA (cost of living adjustment) which has not matched up with recent trends of the local economy. Still underpaid.

Tense culture with constant struggle between administration and clinical staff. The drs want one thing, the administration wants the exact opposite, and you will be stuck in the middle listening to your non-clinical manager rant at you for infractions such as ""having personal decorations in your workspace"" (i.e. a picture of your children) or ""negatively impacting the Centura mission"" for 1-5 min of overtime/ 'late' clockouts after days on end of understaffed, overworked shifts.

I've never worked anywhere where I've been specifically told that when it comes to patient care, ""we care, but not really,"" by management. No support in the workplace, dangerously short staffing, they expect dept RNs to handle patient needs, procedures, setup, room and equipment sterilization, scheduling, patient calls, admin tasks, surgical scheduling, prior authorizations, billing, insurance, you name it, it's added to your job description, all while providing full-time, full shift patient care for your assigned census. Management has specifically been overheard bad-mouthing leadership-trained nurses and RN staff in front of other clinical personnel, comments that ""you may not be able do this job, but maybe another nurse could"" and being reprimanded for daring to even speak with our dept physicians (literally reminded you ""are not on their level"" by manager) are commonplace. Physicians screaming at clinical staff and directors to the point staff leaves crying multiple days per week, clinical staff written up by non-clinical managers for performing licensed and directed patient cares, managers visibly crying on the care floor, verbal altercations between internal staff on a least a multi-day basis per week.... I've never questioned my place in this profession the way I did during my time here.

Difficult, negative, petty, punitive, and high-stress environment, with a side of constant criticism-- it's almost as if they look for the problems rather than solutions?

A female coworker did NO WORK for months along with a sexist attitude toward her male surpervisor (me). This was brought to HR with objective data and copies of passive aggressive demeaning emails. HR did NOTHING, not even a corrective action notice toward the female employee. If you’re male you will be ignored, you will be demeaned and forced to work your job and the non-working female coworker’s job as well.

2018-04-27, IT Director,"Denver, CO",Former Employee ,No integrity left in IT leadership,No integrity left in IT leadership,0,The coworkers that I worked with on a day-to-day basis were some of the best I've encountered in the industry. Centura does not realize the valuable IT people that they have (had). And they are going to lose all of the good IT people the way that things are going.,"The CIO has NO healthcare industry experience. And it shows - completely embarrassing. He also doesn't have a Masters Degree, yet requires it of leadership positions beneath him. He has driven out or fired the incredible leaders that have gotten Centura to the very advanced technological state that it is (especially apparent now as I work at another renowned health care organization that is functioning nowhere near the level that Centura technology functioned). In an effort to mask his inadequacies, he bullied his employees by yelling at and belittling them both in meetings and in private. I actually witnessed him telling an employee that his answer to a question was ""stupid."" There is never a need to belittle and berate employees in a professional setting. I hope to never encounter this complete lack of professionalism again.

To make matters worse, I was in a higher level position, but being paid at a rate that was laughable. Many analysts made more than me. After 2 years and leading HUGE initiatives for the company, I asked for a raise and was ignored. When I threatened to quit, they finally offered me a huge raise, which they said is what I deserved to be getting, and told me it was already in effect before I made my final decision to leave.

Because I could see how dismal the leadership was performing, and how undervalued IT now is at Centura even though they are among the best in the nation (as the accolades show), I kept my integrity and quit anyway, despite the gigantic raise. I was not going to reward a company with my hard work and performance when they treated employees so poorly.

Turns out, they lied about my raise being effective in an effort to manipulate me into staying on the sinking ship (as I was one of the few leaders left keeping things afloat). My last paycheck and PTO payout were exactly the same measly wage that I had been enduring. Just another nail in the coffin.

Lastly...they have lost the drive to put patients first. That is what got me up in the morning. Now it is all about growing the footprint and making more money. The word ""patient"" wasn't even in the manifesto that the new CEO wrote regarding the new direction of the company. Patients should always be at the heart of everything we do. If we are doing what is amazing for the patient, we will become successful. If we are focusing on the wrong things, we will fail. Centura will fail if it continues down this path, and will be eaten by a patient-focused organization before they know it.",Let HR know what you are experiencing.

Communication is excellent and the staff go above and beyond every day.","The PTO offered makes no sense, Overtime isn't offered on certain floors of the hospital, the health insurance is okay, being able to self schedule is dependent on your department on if they allow it, no real encouragement about advancement opportunities or classes to help you expand your function unless you're an RN. Even for basic functions such as desk duties this seems a little silly. Pay for CNA is almost the same as what state minimum wage will be by 2020, so we will see what they'll do about that.
The implementation of EPIC training was all around terrible. Also EPIC is missing a few functions to be able to cover yourself when you report something to the nurse then there's no way to chart that communication. Telling employees to play around with it while only having one or two subpar classes was a little irritating as well.
Also some patients feel the need to verify you are a Christian and it's a little unsettling, but that's not the company's fault.","Share a little love to your employees, employ system changes with a little more finesse, make advancement opportunities a little more easily accessible, and try to treat your company as a community.

Opportunity for bonus in Revenue Management.","Directors in the Revenue Management Division are not aggressive in keeping their teams at full staff. Almost all teams are understaffed and employees are expected to keep up with workload.
New EPIC computer system is working well for the front line staff in hospitals and clinics, but is horribly defective. Employees are told ""they"" are working on it but little has been fixed. This is pervasive throughout the entire Revenue Management system.
Some management follow the spiritual guidelines of the company, others do not follow them in any way. If a company holds itself to a higher standard, then they should stick to that.
Holiday pay is taken from PTO (personal time off). PTO is equal to 2 weeks vacation and 10 holidays a year. No extra time for sick leave, or personal time, like many other companies offer.
Bonus is dependent on ENTIRE 500 employee Revenue Management Division, meeting goals. Individual excellence is not rewarded.
Training for new system was lacking specific training for specific positions. Employees across the entire division were told, ""Play around in the system and figure things out"". This style of training is good for the generations that grew up playing video games, but is not helpful to the older employees who did not. There is no consideration or training for babyboomer generation.
Even though Centura Health is growing it is extremely difficult to promote within the company.

2016-07-13, Behavioral Health Therapist,"Denver, CO",Former Employee ,Reinforcing The Stigma of Mental Health Care (Porter),Reinforcing The Stigma of Mental Health Care (Porter),0,Values-based organization with non-profit status. Adequate benefits including a 401k with employer contributions. Cafeteria and coffee bistro on-site. Cute gift shop. Discounted pharmacy. Use your badge to have purchases deducted from payroll and receive a discount.,"There is inconsistent attention to its facilities. Porter Hospital's campus is large. The main hospital is maintained well and has had extensive remodeling in public-facing areas including the cafeteria, ER waiting room, and and main atrium. However, many parts of the facility are neglected entirely, including the behavioral health units and the outpatient Centre for Behavioral Health.

The outpatient Centre for Behavioral Health located across Harvard on Downing is in dire need of refurbishment, but the Company has refused to invest in it for decades. There is literally rust dripping from the outside of the building onto white paint. The inside of the building hasn't been touched since the eighties, except for some minor configuration changes in one hallway. One day we literally found a letter from OSHA warning us that asbestos was found in the building and that we must take care not to disturb it. Our management sent us a memo telling us to make sure we did not kick any tears in the (30+ year old carpet) because it would activate asbestos. The OSHA memo stated that Porter had failed to respond to the complaints that asbestos was found in the building and thus was posting a public notification.

The air conditioning in the Outpatient Behavioral Health building is broken most of the time, and the building smells like a combination of mold and moth balls. Most of the rooms do not have windows. The patient consult rooms are in the basement (accessible to wheelchairs by ramp) while management sits up top in the non-ADA accessible area, locked away from its employees.

Many clients remark that if they weren't feeling depressed, the dingy carpet with holes (remember, don't kick it, we know about asbestos!), the dim lighting, the Golden Girls Wallpaper, moth ball smell, and rusting away exterior would make them depressed.

The condition of the facility has been brought to the attention of Centura several times, with no action taken. Instead, they are planning on remodeling the already modern cafeteria, as the behavioral health patient care area endures decades of neglect.

Compare the center to any other unit, such as oncology ward or joint replacement clinics, or the brand-new CHPG at Porter, or the sports rehabilitation clinics. You'll see modern architectural details with new stylish surroundings, plush furniture, indoor fountains and waterfalls. These are the areas the hospital makes money.

Go to the Adjacent Porter Centre for Behavioral Health and you will get a clear picture of what is wrong with mental health care in America. It is neglected, pushed to the side, in a basement. It doesn't generate big numbers like cancer, so it continues to decline. It is embarassing to have to explain to patients why the building is in this condition, and they are left feeling second-rate and stigmatized for needing mental health care.

I would recommend those seeking behavioral health care visit their County Mental Health facilities. They are much more modern and will allow you to keep your dignity intact.

Centura's willful neglect of its behavioral health facilities stigmatizes those who require treatment, but they seem to have no intention of turning that around. It is embarassing.","Work collaboratively across all departments. You are a non-profit. Collaborate with leaders to redirect funds to the Centre for Behavioral Health. It is questionable whether that building is even safe. Consider how bad it looks to patients and employees when you take on multi-million dollar remodel project for the cafeteria, yet have a building in dire need of severe overhaul or outright replacement next door. This creates a horrible message of what Centura deeps important in its organization.",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

2015-11-21, Applications Systems Analyst,,Current Employee ,Wouldn't Call It A Career,Wouldn't Call It A Career,0,"Very, *very* laid back environment, which makes it easy to get work done and not be a complete buzzkill. I'm pretty much left to my own devices, after the basic job function is complete (4-6 hours/day). Dress code and attendance policy are very accommodating. Co-workers are amicable and, for the most part, know what they are doing. Work/life balance is pretty good, and probably the highlight of my employment experience. I am salaried and am not required to work much overtime, at all, and PTO is handled fairly in my case (I have heard horror stories, though).","The environment is so laid back, it is to the point of non-professionalism in some departments. Low and Mid-level management, generally, have no idea what they are doing or what the term, ""best process"" means. Career opportunities are very limited in my case, and I have been passed over for promotion many times. Politics is a major factor to success, here. This is a company where the Dilbert Principle (Google it) is in full effect; they want knowledgable, productive workers to stay right where they are at. No promotions for you!!!

Compensation is abysmal: starting ""System Analyst"" pay was $20/hour ($41,600/year). It's not really a System Analyst position; I made it into one and received no recognition or compensation for my efforts, despite numerous improvements to the core functionality of the department. Needless to say, that extra effort stopped pretty quick. Benefits are mediocre at best: high deductible health plan; $3k/year college reimbursement (most places offer $5k); and all fringe benefits—bonuses, PTO cashout, etc.—have been eliminated over the years. Retirement plan changed 3 times over the years: began as defined pension, then 403b, now 401k. How does a non-profit offer a 401k, anyway?

Basically, this is a $4 billion ""non-profit"" (huge air-quotes) that operates like a startup. Nothing is organized; I wrote my own policy and procedure manual, from scratch. They will not provide even the most basic tools to do a technical, customer support position. In my case, this meant certain access and technologies that IT has routine access to. They outright refused to provide this. It took me 4 years to get a laptop with VPN access (after much begging).

The support facility where I am located is a dump: the roof leaks; it's hot in the summer and cold in the winter; the men's bathroom is tiny, one of the stalls is locked, and it has no urinals (WTF??) while the women have 2 bathrooms; the facade of the building and the parking lot are crumbling.","Hire people into management with degrees and/or extensive experience in their field... Please, for the love of God, do this... Fire your ""Talent Management"" or Recruiting team; it is a complete joke. Shift hiring responsibilities to HR, where they should be (instead of the CEO having to sign off on every new hire in a company of 20,000+ employees). Stop outsourcing everything and make it easier for management to open more FTEs. Most lower-level employees are overworked. Compensate more, people don't make enough!

Most of the employees have been around for 15+ years, so many rules and protocols were largely known and unspoken. However, if you break a rule, you will be given a verbal or written warning. One-on-one meetings with management are accusatory, hostile and unproductive at best. They occur often, are unannounced and set a horrible tone for the rest of the day. They are largely out of touch with clinical practice. Nepotism is also apparent. The rules are different for a manager's daughter. One of the managers works about 4 hours a day and is salaried.

And, we are actually having several problems with the new printer.. just seems like a waste of money. And, an unecessary source of new problems. And, we have had to be extremely persistent to have IT even begin to address some of the problems with our particular printer.
A second example- we were told that Centura will be building and opening up several new ambulatory health clinics which will staff new and current Centura employees which was obviously exciting for us. Then, one day, we get an email of the press release video of how Centura and Walgreens are partnering to basically just broaden the scope of what the current Healthcare Clinics at Walgreens already do.
