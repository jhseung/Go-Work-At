One of the more diverse companies I've worked for","Upper management is a mess. There's no direction, goals seemed to change every few weeks, and no one was ever on the same page. Major year long projects were canceled after completion because people forgot to determine if they would actually be profitable. It was unbelievable.

They were never truthful. Obviously we could see that the company was doing badly by looking at the collapse of the stock price and the abysmal earnings calls. The CEO always framed it as if the market wasn't seeing something and that we were actually on the path to profitablity. Obviously not, because the stock is now a penny stock and still sinking.

Morale is at rock bottom. Before and after the second round of layoffs (Nov 2018), tons of important employees left the company. Within weeks of the latest layoff, 5+ extremely important engineers left. There's no money to hire anyone and those that are experienced have either left the company or are looking. They're outsourcing to fill many of the positions, which is a red flag.

Benefits weren't good. No 401K match and ok health insurance.

They did not care well for the people they laid off, including some that worked there for 5 years (almost the entire existence of the company).

Senior management seemed inexperienced and unfocused on both the engineering side as well as the business side. There were meetings that appeared to be an attempt for transparency, but that turned out to be false sense of transparency in the end.

CEO showed lack of caring when there was a large outflux of good talent. Something along the lines of this not being for everyone, and that is okay.","Be honest with your employees.

Employee's professional growth (whether through training, promotion, stretch projects, etc) was not made a priority. Many careers stagnated, while those with the few great managers flourished.

Suffered from a meetings-run-rampant syndrome that resulted in most leadership and middle management being forced to do their ""actual work"" outside office hours (which had a trickle down effect).

- Nice, well-meaning co-workers
- Unlimited PTO
- Casual work environment
- A lot of (albeit missed) opportunity for interesting engineering work","- A fragile and chaotic engineering ecosystem, prone to heavy escalated support burden, with minimal long term vision for any one of the dozens of ""microservices"", and minimal shared tooling among them (unless you count the nascent internal CI/CD platform which is prone to 503ing every few hours and going down completely when Jenkins runs out of disk space)
- General inability of engineering leadership to make clear technical decisions in a transparent, timely fashion paired with DevOps’ unwillingness to grant resources (outside BA’s Rails/Sidekiq/Postgres/Redis wheelhouse) in the absence of leadership approval leads to poor technical decisions or engineering idleness, frustration, fatigue, and resignation
- Internal teams have deadlines and requirements driven by the Business/Operations side; Operations is stuck in tactical, and not strategic, thinking mode because of Blue Apron’s explosive growth paired with inexperienced leadership; most requests coming in from their side are for CRUD with CSV import/export to assist their Excel spreadsheets and macros; data being used in CRUD does not originate or flow through the system in any organized, thoughtful way
- Significant disparities across engineering teams - expect internal teams to have fewer (if any) PMs; designers; project rollout celebrations; well-defined let alone ambitious roadmaps; headcount; etc; also expect that this will correspond to fewer opportunities for engineers on internal teams for promotions or personal growth and that these engineers will neither understand their domains/projects as well nor be as invested in building their projects in a robust manner
- Consumer teams seem to be endlessly implementing trivial A/B tests and redoing the customer registration experience as the company struggles to figure out how to tamp down customer churn
- Engineering team skews heavily towards junior engineers with < 3 years experience; expect many legacy senior engineers to have achieved their titles by churning out Ember/Rails features by rote yet still have significant sway over systems level engineering deliberations; expect actual senior engineers to be too busy fighting Ops, DevOps, ES, rest of engineering leadership to provide meaningful mentorship or effect systemic overhauls; majority of squads have shockingly low velocity
- Recent, rapid churn in engineering leadership of internal teams due to all of the above; expect churn across many engineering teams to continue in the near future
- IPO announcement has led to belt tightening and fewer company events, swag, and even office decorations
- No 401k employer match; little/no gym reimbursement
- Open floor plan; lack of conference space","Continue to encourage engineers to reach out to engineering leadership directly, as this has proven the fastest way to raise awareness and incite action.

Continue to recognize and directly and transparently confront the challenges facing the company and the engineering organization.

Actually invest in internal engineering teams, or else pull the plug on flailing projects and have the business side revert to excel spreadsheets or an off-the-shelf solution.

Identify those engineers both capable of skillful systems engineering and willing to get their hands dirty and actually design and implement it. Lift those engineers rather than ones who can churn out Rails apps and features.
