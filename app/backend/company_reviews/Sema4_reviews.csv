Transition period and rapid growth offers many opportunities for this. Director and managers enjoy hearing ideas from staff and will give them the chance to implement when possible while coaching and sharing their experiences to let staff learn on own and share the credit when changes are successful. Chance to learn laboratory workflows from the ground up provides a career growth trajectory that is unique to most organizations and roles.,"The organization has grown very fast and the workload can be high but process improvements are happening fast and will truly help productivity.

2019-03-29,,,Former Employee ,WARNING: Do not work here!,WARNING: Do not work here!,0,"You can often get away with working remotely and they don't have a way to verify what have you been working on. Which really get abused by people here.
If you have good past experience then you can get a senior job here and just live an easy going life cause they make the lower paid employees do all the work.
Pro's may only exist if you were a former Dell or IBM employee.","If you are reading this before taking a job here or applying, please understand that you are working here only to learn things, forget the money part. You can learn by breaking things and there is no issues, there is no discipline, regulations or policy that exist.
You may be given a raise without any documentation or your consent to understand why were you under rated. Bonus is what you will be waiting for till the end of the year and realize that it's was a joke, then you'll keep waiting the next raise, that's where you realize you yourself have been taken as a joke here. There are no targets set by HR or your bosses. In short HR is handicapped.
COO is a big bully. The Lab is over crowded and there is not a seat for employees to sit. its more like traveling in a subway during peak hours.
If you visit the LinkedIn page you will see over 7000 followers but when they post something there is barely 15 likes, just about 0.2% which clearly says it's just fake followers as well! In fact any glassdoor review with more than three stars may also be fake most probably, if you are smart enough you can read and understand.
All the smart people have already been leaving the company in groups of 4 and 5 people at a time in the past 3-5 months. its too easy to find another job at a better salary with less stress if you look for it, I only know better after leaving.
Lack of structure and direction to the company is a big problem here.
Director titles are given to people who don't necessarily know ABC's of their field but are instead big talkers(there are some few really nice directors here) and a person who really knows and understands work will never given a title more than level one or two. That reminds me I forgot to mention in the pro's section, you have the freedom to write whatever title you want below your name in email signature and no one cares.

Please don't get too excited, be patient and look for a better place to work. And if you are really not that good and don't find a job anywhere at all then feel free to go here.","Where is the management? Get some management please.

Since the new year this place went downhill fast. I got out of it quick. Terrible management to unprofessional employment changes. slow HR. Low pay and sometimes they mess up the paycheck with incorrect payment. if you lose track they will take your money from paycheck.

Directors and supervisor micromanaging. If you are belong to their cast you are good . Full of racism.

they Implement changes without prior notice . one week is salary next week is hourly . They can take your desk away and give it to the people they like. Poor communications.

Some assistant director will tell you to do something and they will say do not tell senior directors.

They will promise to give you a raise and then make you wait for a year or more. working there was like a dead end .

If your family member is working here then you will move up fast. Because they want you to stay there day and night and work.

This place is horrible and going downhill fast. I'm glad I got outta there!
I left this place for a lesser paying position but I am 100 times more happy where I am now.
worst place ever!!!

The ability to create your own policies as they do not exist.

Stock options, well don't hold your breath. Employees were told Jan. 2018, but never received stock options. One can only conclude that the top of the pyramid has all the stock options lining their pockets.

The company may get VC and expand, However an infusion of money will not change your comp package. Therefore, employees can only hope they sell and a professional management team clears house and gets rid of idea guys who talk all day.

You can feel positive knowing that your next career move is gaurenteed to be better for your career and family.

The ability to sit on your hands, avoid responsibility, ownership and work a normal day.

You can climb the corporate ladder by getting a PhD and you can feel good paying for the degree. You might even get a 3% raise by increasing your value.

Management training consists of studying terrible managers so that you understand what strategies do not work.

HR department works for the company and not the employee. If you send an inquiry you are not likely to get a response.

There is a marina out back where you can dock your boat. The inflation raise and 3% bonus should get you a blow up raft.

Consulting can give you a significant comp increase and you can choose to work from any location.","Management has no integrity.

Bully COO balanced with ""friendly"" VP cronies.

5 companies exist with no unified goal.

Comp is below market value. The bonus you expect for your family sacrifices is the sum total of the group bonus pool.

No stock options, so you are not going along for the ride.

Understaffed and you are likely to be overloaded and destined to fail without proper resources.","Stop building employee moral by announcing that you don't believe in inflation raises. Stating that employees should be happy to have a job is abrasive.

2018-10-30,,,Current Employee ,Where good grads go to die,Where good grads go to die,0,The support network established by fellow lab members to weather the storm of upper management; good coworkers (in general) are why many people still remain despite the endless workload,"Management at Sema4 is really only interested in one thing - how many hours of unpaid overtime they can squeeze out of you. Work-life balance is non-existent for many lab techs, and it's painful to see once-happy people reduced to husks of their former selves. Even worse, your good work is rarely appreciated - it's only noticed if you make a mistake (which, given how overworked everyone is, will become more & more common).
Once you are placed in a group, you will most likely remain in that group until you leave. There are no opportunities to learn any new skills beyond what your daily job requires; they don't mind if you languish under the monotony of repeating the same tasks every day. Sema4 is a place with a highly-educated workforce, but you wouldn't know it based on how condescending higher-ups are; several supervisors are so poisonous, it boggles the mind as to how they are still employed. Some are sympathetic to the existential dread facing lab techs every day, but can do nothing to stop it. Transparency is nil, and the reality in the lab seems far divorced from the reality of the sales team. Sample volume has doubled over the last year, but the amount of techs hasn't changed - if we aren't all working 7 days a week in the next year, I'd be surprised (that's if we're all still working there next year; the company is bleeding lab techs).
Overall, there are not enough machines to handle the sample volume, there are not enough people, there is very little physical space for more machines or people. It's almost comical if it wasn't so tragic.","If you expect all lab techs to think of this job as a stepping stone, and neglect them over and over again, it's going to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
2018-10-19, Laboratory Coordinator,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Horrible management,Horrible management,0,"It's easy work, and people in your group are really great and supportive. I guess when times get rough, you stick together.","People are leaving, and they continue to ignore issues by creating a high employee turnover. We are piled on top of one another- there is simply not enough room for all of the employees we have. Yet the sample load continues to increase, and they will not stop hiring people. There are many days where I have had to stand up and eat lunch. Those of us who work in the laboratory, despite being highly educated, are treated like we are disposable. Our ideas are ignored. We are warm bodies and mindless drones to them. If you don't like it, you will be replaced by a bright eyed, bushy tailed recent college graduate for half the price. It has been made quite clear where we stand. The directors call everyone- PhD or master's degree- ""the techs"". I once asked for the opportunity to move into a new role, and the director I spoke with told me she didn't think I'd understand the job tasks. At Sema4, you're a line cook with no future. You will not move up here unless you are white or married to someone high up.

Lisa Edelmann is truly one of the most vile and aggressive individuals I have ever been around. She has created a toxic work culture, and now everyone who has worked with her for a long time and endured her abuse are now just as abusive. She talks down to people and makes them cry.

HR consists of 3 people who rarely answer emails. Awful benefits. No education support.","Why not look at the directors and supervisors as you question why so many people are leaving? There are some supervisors who are so insufferable that their subordinates leave, and no one has looked into these issues. Stop hiring your family and friends because you are so desperate for help.
