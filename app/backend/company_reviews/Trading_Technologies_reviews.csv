Teamwork isn't something that we strive to do well, it's the baseline. We count on each other, we communicate, we acknowledge when miscommunications happen and we recognize when we fall short. I've been pushed to do better and gain new skills mostly because I don't want to say no or let down my colleagues. I can't say that's always been comfortable, but I get it. As anywhere, some days are longer than others.

No, we don't all sing Kumbaya all the time, but as a baseline we see each other as human beings and that's a pretty good place to start. My team has changed in the time I've been at TT, and sure, there has been some frustrations occasionally, but those generally ease up before too long. I generally feel empowered and trusted to fulfill my duties in the way I see fit, and to reach out and grab new opportunities.","Yes, the company has been undergoing changes – but, c'mon it's now partially a SaaS company and pivoting is kind of the point – and it's always uncomfortable to see things change, even when you want them to. I've lived through personnel changes, perk amendments, and product pivots, but I always feel informed as to why things are changing and given the information to back it up. Sure, not as quickly as I'd always like, but I haven't worried endlessly about why a change is happening either before a company-wide answer has been provided.

And, of course, the bonuses could always be better.","I've never expected much interaction with a CEO or to hear from one on a routine basis outside of your typical company-wide newsletter, but Rick has surprised me.

Some departments during review time think that you need to be superhuman to get a high score cause they expect everyone to work themselves sick on a regular basis or your not doing your job. Also management (not really upper management) can play favorites in some departments. If your not part of the group you are treated as an outsider. I've seen whole departments go to lunch and leave one or two people behind and not even ask them if they wanted to go.

2016-12-20,,,Former Employee ,Sad to see what they have done to the firm and worse to see what they have done to their employees.,Sad to see what they have done to the firm and worse to see what they have done to their employees.,0,"Was a great company to work for. Was an industry leader. Still has some great people but given time, management will weed them out. A lot less clients that need tending to. But hey, you get free breakfast....","Before I explain why I have decided to give my review and warn anyone thinking about going to work for or staying employed by TT against doing so, let me first say that I look back at TT as the best job I ever had; I learned a lot and worked with some amazingly smart, talented and creative people. What was once a fun, energizing, merit based, groundbreaking firm has been horribly neutered and lobotomized into a systemically dysfunctional firm full of 1) depressed veterans looking for an exit that won’t get them sued and 2) clueless young yes men who don’t realize (yet) that the light at the end of the tunnel is actually the headlamp of an oncoming freight train.
      It’s sad to sit back and watch this once great company spiral towards the ground due to mismanagement and a fear to admit that they were wrong. The current regime has this dream of running a young, edgy fintech start up but instead have taken an established industry leader and cut out almost everyone who had anything to do with it becoming that industry leader. This is ironic because if those exiled people hadn’t built TT into an industry leader, the guys who fired them would never have been interested in joining the firm in the first place. The knowledge and experience drain that has taken place over the last 3-4 years is staggering, and the industry is watching and rightfully worried. Their arrogance has manifested itself in many ways, but is particularly evident in their decision to create a product that the majority of the industry (and their existing paying customers) do not want. This compounded their insistence to force everyone on to it instead of allowing them to choose. This has resulted in an adoption rate still in the lower single digits, about 4 years of stagnated innovation, and all time high ""anti-TT"" sentiment in the industry. One might excuse this as simply bad executive decision making and blind narcissism, but what I find absolutely inexcusable is the way management has treated so many of these people with such complete disrespect. If you’re over 40 or someone who has worked hard to add value to your role and have actually been rewarded for it, now suddenly you are viewed as a liability and are shown the door. Their most despicable tactic is when, instead of saying something like, “Thank you for all of your hard, productive work over the years, and we apologize for not being able to keep you on board. Here is a severance package to help you and your family during this life altering transition”, these people are essentially holding your severance hostage unless you allow them to enforce their ridiculous Non-Compete clause. Now, in fairness, if an employee decided on their own that they wanted to leave the firm, it would be understandable to not want them to go directly to the competitor. But to just callously fire someone without cause after years of exemplary service and then say “Oh, by the way, you can’t do your job anywhere else or we will sue you”? That is not only unethical and morally reprehensible, it is just being a bully. They know that you can’t just ""pull a TT” and sue them; You’re unemployed. They know you can’t risk the legal costs even if you could win. I would say this is shameful but they have no shame. I mean, either you find someone valuable, and want them to work for you, or you don’t. If you find them to be valuable, don’t lay them off! If you don't want them to work for you, say thank you, give them a fair severance package, and wish them well.
      But unfortunately, they have to figure out some way to cover the costs of this disastrous new platform. In the meantime, they will continue to ignore the needs of their customer base, roll out unfinished software before it is ready, announce bold ""enhancements"" that the rest of the industry already built years ago, and most importantly: work on the highest priority items, like having the CEO and CTO spend their days personally responding to these legitimate Glassdoor reviews and having HR suddenly plant a bunch of vague, buzzword-loaded and obviously fake positive ones. Fire up the old “Keep up the good work!” spin machine. And don't spare the exclamation points. Those really add to your credibility.","C- level management - Start treating employees more like you say you treat them. Figure out that their knowledge and passion don't expire when they hit 40.

Absolute lack of advancement opportunities - no matter how long you've worked at TT your title is simply a ""Software Engineer"". I wasn't the only one who who felt this was designed to make it harder for employees to go elsewhere.
CEO keeps coding and checking code into production system behind everyone's back. No wonder the platform is unstable and keeps confusing buy for a sell.
CEO has a huge ego and compensates himself very well. Yet he does nothing to sell the company so that ordinary employees can benefit. We are still waiting for our shares to be worth something. The stock valuation has been the same for a few years now, meaning they are depreciating due to inflation.
Management is useless. They keep pressuring developers to release new features but don't understand that in this business stability and correctness is king. Nobody cares about shiny UI if you can't get the basics right.

These confidants of classified confidence are anything but discreet. You can usually find out about an impending layoff or firing by engaging one of the many leaks in the HR department.

Be careful what you say, how you say it and who you say it to. Assume everyone wants something for nothing and will do whatever it takes to get ahead. Confidential is a relative term at TT and people (even your friends) will jump at the chance to air your dirty laundry just to make themselves look better or more relevant.

I have personally witnessed TT's non-standard treatment of employees. I suppose this must prove they are not afraid to abandon decency and the human factor in many levels. Employees who engage in unethical behavior can expect to remain employed because of who they know. On the flip side, flirting with the appropriate people and sucking at your job will also get your far at TT.

Toward the end of my time at TT, I never was afforded the opportunity to work on the projects that I wanted. Even when I asked. I guess that's difficult when you're surrounded by lunacy coupled with the fact that your manager never shows up to the office.",TT's greatest resource is the amount of human capital. Talent.

They built a bar, put on shows at marketing meetings, and try hard to have a cool vibe.+

They have ""town hall"" meetings, bagels and a dart board... they embrace multiple coding languages and many forms of technology as they span the legacy system and newer versioning.

Co workers truly know what they are doing.

Flexible work schedules are a positive, overall the benefit package is pretty great too. So there are a few things that can be taken as a positive.","Cons, there are a lot. Read Glassdoor, you hear a few people who are loving it (likely because they were asked to post a positive review (this happens here)) or completely opposite are scorned people who are out or want out. There is nobody in the middle. Concerning, there are not typical employees who just go and are okay with it?

Sales is a mess. There only managers and nobody who does the real work. Bonuses are something of the past ...

Good people have been laid off while others who lack true talent have been promoted. The ones who stay sit in silence knowing they have the best paying, low-effort dev gig out there.

Product management. It is not done properly here. PM's have no clue what it takes to code or build a product, they cant write specs to save their life. They are condescending toward engineers.

There is a disconnect between those who dictate the direction of the technology and the clients they serve. They just seem to lack understanding of the customers and who really moves money from props to big banks and hedgers. And how to manage people or communicate effectively. And the positions at the top of Technology have been a revolving door in the past 5-6 years with multiple CTO's come and gone.

HR: If a question about benefits comes, you receive a link to what could be construed as an answer or you get a blank stare and asked about your fitbit. There is a power struggle at the top, it has effected their approchability and performance many times over. They stem rumors with talk at the bar, shouting down the hall, in a small conference room- employee financial struggles, garnishments, salaries, bonuses, etc. They seem to have inappropriate relationships with other coworkers. So keep your confidence in them in check.

 Legal department. From countless hours at the gym to endless games of Golden Tee, they are frustrating. Especially when enforcing of a terrible non compete that literally keeps you from working in the industry again.

Secret meetings happen all the time. Everyone is knows they are a severance payment and non compete fight away from unemployment. And it seems like you are always the last to hear a classified piece of information about yourself.

Con 8- The trading group could be used to help the developers and product people make qualified decisions about product bugs. But its now been moved offsite and an even further barrier of communication has developed.

This place has turned soul-less and lost the human factor. Many of the people at the top are bad, bad, bad. Genuine human character is gone, they would rather focus on grudges and petty squabbles than being professional and making the company good. Most of the people are just frustrated and looking, others are filling in time for fear of finding a gig that pays the same to do just that little work.","Only management to talk to...the owner and the CEO. The rest are not to be trusted to take opinions into account.

2015-06-29, Product Manager,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,"TT can be a good place, it mostly was to me!","TT can be a good place, it mostly was to me!",0,"I want to start this ""pros"" section by stating, I was only merely thinking about writing a review. And unlike 50% of the company that has been terminated in one form or another over the past few years, I left on my own free will. I feel that I left on great terms, I hope I did! After a terrifically written novel of a review popped up on this very site minutes after I started my new gig, the vicious rumor mill that swirled the halls of TT eventually made its way all the way back to me as a former employee. I was being congratulated for someone's writing- I wanted to set the record straight. However, Anon (seriously readers, give it a read too, less bitter Betty than some of the slander of TT with some pointed personal digs), you did a good write-up and I agree with many of your statements! Other reviewers seem to have been caught out in non-promotion land or layoffs and spew hatred. So read these things with caution.

TT offered me a look into an industry I knew nothing about. I came, not knowing a long from a short. I didn't know a spread in Vegas sports books from spread trading. My immediate peers were terrific mentors, and the head of my group was the best mentor I could ask for. I was in a small prime-cut of TT that made the experience for me at the start. I fell into a number of different roles in the company while riding in the wake of my mentor (which nobody can complain about moves and compensation increases) and worked with many departments. TT offered this- if you chose to get involved (many don't) you can literally work with every department in the firm from any role. To steal a word from another review- at times it truly is collegiate with collaboration.

The regular people in the trenches are the gems of the organization. The guys answering the phones in an under appreciated job of support, the never heard traders, the non-execs of any division are the heart beat of this place. There is some wild talent. There are a few talking heads raking in over-compensation doing good work, while others rode the mass of talent in the guise that it was their work and genius. Rare circumstances proved top-dogs were not in it JUST for cashing in when the place sells or padding the resume for a C-level job at some other firm. These few seem to be invested in really, truly, wanting it to be a good place. So if you want, there are a number. Attach to them and it will help your gig. The others will be gone in a revolving door of executive management.

The office has been revamped, weird timing considering the company had just been cut nearly in half, but who cares- there never would be a ""good"" time. The place and culture needed something after every other person had been whacked. There was a new savior of a CEO in, and a new platform on the way. Why not new start? I wish they had waited to buy out an old trading pit and embrace the culture rather than build pool tables and bars (I did love me the pool table however), but it was awesome. Likely you wont get a job with a bar, pool table, mounds of free food, and bags tournaments in the game room- or yoga. Unless you go work at Google. Its very nice. And a huge thank you to the forgotten facilities people who make it happen and nice daily.

I liked working for TT- and quite frankly though I felt mistreated by the company at times (job ambiguity out the wazoo and was twice told I might be laid off to not be) I grew and developed there.","I laugh at this section, its a free place to post up personal grievances. But here is one thing to kick it off I have thought was funny from moment one. When a former employee was terminated and went rogue tweeting up a storm of hatred in the company, it was a shock. Management sent out emails of how it hurt feelings and was not called for, how it was so terrible. This was a unique circumstance that rocked the boat for days. But on an hourly basis some blog somewhere, some tweet somewhere, some support person inside TT hears much worse things about the old-school platform losing them money/breaking and nobody really cares. Or so it seems- blindly going forward with the the thing and letting the old, well, be old. Feelings are hurt and egos are dinged and personal emails of panic go to the company. While when the face of the company is dragged over the coals by the smallest single prop trader to the biggest of banks-client for the umpteenth time, nothing is said. Or internal meetings and grudges arise saying they are a pain in the *** client. Interesting logic there.

I almost said TT is an enigma, but that's a lie. Every company embodies weird politics, rumors, preferential treatment to less than terrific employees based on old friendships. And all places have not so nice people. TT had plenty of each. I certainly could write a laundry list of people that I disliked or that I wouldn't trust as far as I could throw them- in friendship and especially in business. These being from low positions to Ivory-tower high-places of power. I would prefer not working with these out-for-them-self, surface-level individuals again, but industry is small and crossover might happen. Thats why TT is not an enigma, everywhere has them...they are easy to spot. Especially if you are not REALLY buying into the new vibe. Its cold standing in the face of the wind...very cold.

From reading other reviews: those who complained that development was dead, opportunities didn't exist, and opinions are not heard. I semi agree, but then again I don't. Cop out, to me. Like anything, navigate away form the bad seeds and your voice may be heard. Don't sit in a shell with headphones on typing away all day. Realize that some people there are great, and that anyone no matter what the title is a person- approach anyone. If you want talk to them- if they are ""too cool for school,"" then move along. Its business, not high school. Realize that some of the people that you would assume would be your confidential source for help or complaints are a barely functioning themselves and you better go it on your own. Trust yourself in this place, and don't rely on others unless you REALLY know they are willing to help you as much as you will help them. My boss told me the first weeks, ""you notice why nobody is answering your questions, its because they want something from you first."" This is true in an individual profit group just as much as a company.

Get it in writing. When you hear you will get a raise or a bonus of X dollars, get it written and signed. Don't wait for it. You may or may not get a different amount blamed on a typo, nothing, or have multiple months of horrific confusion whilst a carousel of confusion tells you they don't know your employment situation. All happened here. It built resentment and made me realize that networking would be my greatest achievement in any role. A place to bounce always seemed like it needed to be near...

Finally. Great people have been forced to quit or have been terminated because they didn't perfectly fit the mold. While others who deserved to be fired within minutes of poor actions remained in the company much- much longer. Mind boggling. I guess make the right friends...","Know that even though I had a laundry list cons. the pros generally outweighed it still. I wrote nothing negative in my exit paperwork because I knew one of 2 things would happen. (a) my confidential information would be out there for the taking with my name attached to it in the social fodder of the people I told it to or (b) nothing would happen.

Try to build trust. ""Total trust,"" was a campaign idea that failed, but at least it was a try. But generally trust your people. Give them information, give them trust, be more forthcoming about whats going on and they will repay you many times over. And break down walls between groups even more. It will be worth it.

AND FINALLY- I will agree with anyone who has reviewed or said this. Be more present to your clients. When you come in- ask questions and stop saying over excitedly and energetically, ""its coming, its coming, its coming."" Sub-par back office systems, SOD oddness, and others cause real fiscal pain. Pain that is more than a non-trader, product or sales person would know. Say, ""we know this is an issue and I am sorry, we are sorry. We know that our mistake has caused you and your clients downstream issues. We will do what we can to fix it. And appreciate you telling us and trusting us to help."" It sounds cheesy, but it could help...

Also understand the client. Trading is hard, trading is horrible, and a few lucky ones stick with it. Its expensive and TT is a huge cost monthly to a minor prop guy to a huge bank trader. Show more appreciation for that cost.",3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Free beer!,"I recently left TT after having worked here for several years. Here is my personal opinion on what’s wrong with the company: This used to be a good place to work. I remember looking forward to coming to the office, because we were solving interesting problems. Through engineering, we were providing value to our customers and enabling them to be more successful. We liked what we were working on. All of this changed when Rick Lane became CTO. Rick hated everything about TT’s culture and made it his personal goal to change it. Instead of leveraging existing talent and taking advantage of what was already built (ya know – the whole “standing on the shoulders of giants” thing), Rick decided to throw it all away and start from scratch. There is nothing wrong with this approach per se, but the execution was simply terrible. He created a new team and right away encouraged the “us versus them” mentality. It was not fun watching my friends work on a new project that was going to “replace us all”. While Rick’s inner circle chugged away re-writing the existing system, the remainder of the company was busy paying their salaries. People supporting the legacy system did not get any recognition, while Rick’s team was given bonuses under the table. We all became frustrated and eventually bored with our jobs. What was the point to all of this? What happened to fairness? How about career development? The funny thing was that even “the chosen ones” shared our frustration. I guess rewriting the same code over and over and over in different programming languages is not very exciting. Rick would force implementations on them, openly going against their professional judgment. Those 3 months at Google hardly made Rick Lane an engineer. His technical decisions always seemed to backfire so, naturally, he made the developers be “on-call” to answer phone calls and fix the broken, hastily written code. We all started asking – why are we doing this to ourselves? These are the best years of our twenties!
Top talent quickly started to depart. People who helped run this company for the past ten or so years. Rick’s response was something along the lines of “I was expecting to see more people quit by now”. Obviously he did not respect any of us.
The saddest part? Almost every developer who decided to put in notice had to fight the legal department. TT’s non-compete agreement is completely one-sided and very broad; it covers pretty much anything. Other companies pay you if they decide to assert the non-compete. TT seems to be okay to see you starve. The “preferred” way of getting a release letter is to surrender your hard-earned options. This is cruel, since the company did not pay bonuses (I hear they started now).

In the past, one of the big benefits of working at this company was that you could put in your 9-5 and not worry a bit about work until the next day.

The company's *excellent* phone support staff handled all Level 1 type incidents, problems that were escalated were usually okay to wait until the next day.

Email threads went on until 10:45PM on Saturday. On Monday, the emails started up at 8:45AM.

Putting in quality work five days a week is no longer enough to maintain your position. There has been a steady trickle of firings for the past couple of years, so falling behind your peers isn't just a missed opportunity for a larger raise. Simply performing instead of over-performing can definitely mean losing your job.

This is the environment of a high-paced startup, but the company is not a startup. There is a stock option plan but no roadmap to going public. Company is large enough that there is still a bureaucracy, there is a small chance you will influence decision making, and you will work on the same thing indefinitely. The company is on a long term course to get smaller and smaller, so it is not as if you stay on for five years you're going to accidentally find yourself in charge of a large department because the company took off.","Be honest with your employees. If the future culture of the company is going to be this never ending 16 hours a day, 7 days a week schedule, give employees the opportunity to get out if they don't agree with it. You still have everyone under a one-year non-compete agreement.

The median age of your employees is pretty high. This is no longer a company of twenty-somethings. Do not expect all of your employees with families to be able to indefinitely sustain this level of output.",1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

The company size in India is small, but don't consider it a run-of-the-mill startup waiting for funding. It is an extension of the development teams located in Chicago, London, Singapore and is a subsidiary of Trading Technologies Inc, Chicago, US.
Provides everything a software engineer can ask - good salary, good facilities, work-life balance(work from home option), myriad state-of-the-art technologies ranging from big data, python, cloud systems, full-stack development, no-sql related data bases, chef, dockers, git - you name it, it's there. Furthermore, it's an engineers' prerogative to choose the technology he is most comfortable with to accomplish a task, of course, with certain provisos.
Gives a sense of ownership as you would be responsible for module(s) solely, yet get help from SME's across the globe.
Colleagues, manager, counterparts are always ready to help and don't believe in ridiculing or mocking. The intention is always to get the features delivered through collaborative effort.
Less red-taping, more work - we don't get bogged down with unnecessary process related documents, yet the regulatory norms are always maintained.
Summary, you deliver the best when your mind is at ease, and that's precisely the philosophy this company reinforces.

Not a good equation.",0,"Good benefits, salary, and work/life balance. Low level management is fairly harmless and you will find a number of very smart people. For the most part you will get a good feeling of ownership on your projects and encounter interesting problems. However, it is very easy to get pigeonholed after you become an expert in a certain area.","Two main problems here. #1 - senior management has no idea how to run a software company. They are constantly making famous, well-known mistakes that you can read about in Mythical Man Month. There are some smart engineers here and their ideas are summarily ignored by upper management. E.g., they make senior developers do QA jobs (literally, write and execute tests!), give software process and project leadership to project managers who have no software background. It can be quite frustrating and ends up diminishing morale and enthusiasm.

#2 - while there are many smart engineers, there are too many poorly qualified engineers and testers. Unless you're really bad, you won't get let go and every gets promoted/raises despite their performance. This ultimately lowers the good engineers' value. There were countless times that good engineers came up with brilliant solutions only to be told to ""dumb them down"" because others might find them too complex.","First and foremost, replace the CTO with one who knows about software. That means they need a computer science background, need to have been a developer in a company, know about software process, need to be a programming expert. Second, remove the cruft - they're only slowing you down. Listen to the good engineers, promote them, let them lead... and get out of the way - stop micromanaging.",2.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,
