2019-01-30,,,Current Employee ,"Be realistic, no job will be perfect.",,0,"It's so clear that some of the recent reviews were written by people in their first job who may not realize work is not going to be fun 100% of the time or just don't like their position. Samsara is my third full time job out of college and it blows the other two companies out of the water. The entire company cares about your success and is willing to invest in your professional growth. You can change teams if you don't like your position. Some of the negative reviews around sales seem to focus on just not liking sales itself. At any company, sales will be grindy and you'll feel underpaid if you aren't hitting quota. Luckily, Samsara allows you to switch career paths within the company after just six months, so anyone who doesn't like sales can try a new path. Samsara has free lunch and tons of company activities and I really don't think there's much to complain about. Benefits are also completely above average (especially for a startup) and there's an extremely high caliber of talent and extremely intelligent people from the CEO down. Culture is great as well, everyone is friends and there's literally a slack channel to get automatically matched with a person you've never met so you can grab coffee. Plus, there's tons of clubs you can join if you want to be friends with your coworkers. Like any job or group, the culture is what you make of it and you can either take advantage of the perks or not.",I genuinely can't think of any. Any complaints (even about small things like the catering) seem to get addressed very quickly by the company.,Make sure culture scales as you grow and be certain new hires are a personality fit for the company. Make sure your managers are fully trained even if they're young and maybe invest in a leadership program to be certain of this.

Good Benefits
Stock Options- the company has had a meteoric rise and seems destined to continue to do so
Superior product & a gifted engineering dept.
Free lunches
$200 a month Uber/Lyft credits
Fast tracked career due to success","Culture:
Sink or swim. Great if you're doing well and really miserable if you aren't. At times it felt like a scene from the Wolf of Wall Street. It's a highly pressurized grind culture, very bro-y with limited diversity. There is an expectation that you are at your desk at all times.

Day to day:
Pipe is 80%+ self sourced. You'll need to cold call a few hours a day every day. Quoting, getting discount approvals and generating proposals could be much more efficient.

Financing- I believe this has been covered in another review but this is the most frustrating part of the Samsara sales cycle. A 3rd party financing company is required to give monthly payment options (an industry standard in transportation) to customers. A large % of customers are not approved and you are left in a situation where someone wants to purchase and you literally can't sell the product to them. This may be a teething problem as Samsara grows but it is a huge source of frustration especially as targets grow.

Business Systems/Processes:
Often try to build in-house systems and bolt them onto the CRM which leads to things inevitably breaking. Fixes for these bugs can take weeks and even months, probably a teething problem but very frustrating. It's hard to know if this is a cost saving thing but the cost to productivity should justify investment in some better systems.

Work/life balance- This is not something that is fostered. It's a regular occurrence that reps receive calls from management and directors whilst on PTO. Expect calls in the evenings and on the weekend from your customers and prospects.

Other-
Without going into specifics communication was poor. ADR's take a paycut to progress to AE which I've never heard of before. Pay discrepancies between people doing the same role were common. Targets seemed to be plucked from the air, increasing by 230% when I was there with no additional resources and smaller patches.

In summary, Samsara isn't for everyone, but it may be for you. Don't expect to be developed as a rep but if you can grind it out there is real earning potential. For me the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. There are companies that are better to work for who pay more in the Bay Area. If you get a funny feeling when interviewing that this might not be the place for you you are probably right. If you love the grind, high pressured fast pace environments and enjoy cold calling you'll love it.","Acknowledge and act on growing pains.

Best product in (very saturated) market
Out of pros","1. You're underpaid by market standards. You'll need to avg 200% to make market
2. Your daily activities and tasks are micromanaged
3. The buying persona is typically unprofessional
4. The product itself (while ahead of the competition) is not a core part of the business and will never be treated as a crucial business decision (forecasting impossible)

Okay now why I left...
1. Culture. Culture. Culture.
2. You're not invested in as a professional.
3. The overall growth attracts high sales talent but then you step into what seems like an entry level sales role.
4. Boys club. You're in the club or you're not. If you're not sure, you're not in.
5. Many aspects of sale in this vertical are beyond reps control (financing, financing, financing) - but you don't hit once and you're put on plan. Has nothing to do with rep competence or effort.
6. For the sake of credibility - I never missed quota. My avg attainment was over 300% and I chose to leave and haven't regretted it for a minute.

My advice to those considering. If you have a weird sense, like you're not quite sure if its a good fit.. go with your gut.

-Long term opportunity for growth?","-Upper management seems to only care about the bottom line. Very much feel like a number who can be replaced. There is a sense that management is more concerned with hiring new employees as opposed to the current players.

-Call centered environment. The expectation is to make from 50-100 cold calls per day (on top of any other tasks you already have). You feel more like a telemarketer as opposed to an AE.

-Heavily micromanaged. There is a watchdog type style of management which is instilled into the sales culture. You are judged by “dials” made almost as much as closed opportunities. Additionally, you are expected to be at your desk (making calls) for the entirety of the day. Management send not so subtle messages when not hitting the number of calls (like being removed from the inbound lead queue).

-Unrealistic expectations for achievement/growth. They underpay for the market with the expectation of over achievement. On the surface it seems very appealing to jump onboard, especially with the achievement numbers that they throw around while recruiting (200% average quota attainment per rep, with high accelerators). With the hyper-growth taking place at Samsara, these numbers are a thing of the past.

Benefits:
-High-growth startup
-Huge potential for quota over achievement for inside sales
-Truly differentiated fleet-management product set with superb engineering team
-Excellent executive leadership","-Extensive Travel for field employees (3-4 days per week, nearly every week)
-Work/life balance is extremely rough in the field - I had very limited time with my family as compared to my previous employees
-Long sales cycles for enterprise deals, but you are expected to grow your business every single quarter... the field is really feast or famine each quarter with one or two deals ultimately deciding your fate.
-Most events/benefits that others have called out are only relevant for the employees based in the Bay Area offices. Field employees don't get any love","Have more regular cadences with your field employees about what they are happy with and what they aren't happy with, and then genuinely take the feedback about the stuff they aren't happy with and try to make some changes.

I was excited to join a small company of 200 employees after working for one of the largest tech companies in the world. After 3 years with Apple I began to feel like another cog in the machine. Rarely did I see the fruits of my labor. Even after only 3 months at Samsara I know I couldn’t have made a better career switch. Everyday I walk into work I feel like I’m making a difference in the company. Every customer we help, every problem we solve, every sale we close is contributing to the growth of a company I’m personally invested in. Samsara’s management understands that creating a successful employer/employee relationship begins by trusting their employees. Like other startups, Samsara hands out free swag alongside other awesome benefits, but in the end these gestures are more than simply having more Samsara hats and t-shirts then I know what to do with. These practices are indicitive of a company culture that fosters loyalty in it’s employees.",Fast growth makes adjusting and learning difficult. Be sure to ask lots of questions.
