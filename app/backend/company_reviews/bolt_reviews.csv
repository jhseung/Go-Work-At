The salary is not good compared to other IT companies. You can be in charge of a lot of things and still earn less than in a non-managerial role somewhere else.

Don't expect to be only doing your own job and that your responsibilities are not going to be changed (increased). Don't expect your salary to reflect the change in responsibilities.

Supersonic growth that unlocks some opportunities -but only for certain positions. Interesting challenging tasks and generous pay for the engineering roles. Comfortable office.","Extreme chaos due to lack of process, thoughtful analysis and very poor communication - between teams, between management and their respective teams. No formal or informal training for newbies. Mid management tends to micromanage, senior was mediocre or inadequate, unintelligible, hard to reach and even oppressive. Zero visibility into what's going on in teams daily interacting with each other. Very little transparency company-wide, bad expansion planning and coordination. That with a constant corporate ideology imposing (""No corporate BS"" claim translates into a complete contrary IRL). All of which causing tons of unnecessary stress, high effort + low productivity for the customer-facing people, especially Customer Support, who are expected to ""go the extra mile"" of work with below-market salaries and zero recognition, just because ""hey we're the fastest-growing European startup"". Support is treated as an ever-junior role and not a serious career. Constant feedback from the teams about the same repetitive customer problems goes simply unheard. Senior management seems to not give a damn and is unwilling to talk, listen, analyze feedback and invest into improvement of any of these - as long as the machine runs and grows. Moreover, the senior leadership seem to consciously promote and genuinely enjoy this stress-poisoned environment, encouraging outrageous alcohol abuse during company events, probably some at making people forget about the existing problems. Ill work-life balance. One the most toxic and nightmarish workplaces in my life.","If you care, listen more carefully to your ground and frontline people, not just to the managers and friends who you promote. Invest into employee happiness, development and empowerment, transparent processes, real communication and feedback analysis. Stop aggressively feeding BS to people that you are ""revolutionizing"" anything - they are not that stupid.
