Writing about sports is fun, especially if you like sports (and you wouldn't be doing this job if you didn't). The editors are responsive, for the most part.","I used to tell my friends that B/R is a good place to cut your teeth as a writer. That may have been the case when I started — though in the eyes of some, I was disillusioned from the start. In either case, I no longer believe that to be true. The sites writing hierarchy is broken down into lead writers and featured columnists, the latter of which are content monkeys that write a mix of original (pitched by writer) and ""prebudgeted"" (assigned by the editor) content. Oftentimes, the prebudgeted content is almost exactly the same from week to week, though with minor tweaks in the headline, which leads to a lot of regurgitation. You'll find yourself writing the same thing over and over, especially during the offseason. There is little if any opportunity to be creative as a writer due to all the assigned content/slideshows.

I have heard countless stories of B/R moving on from/firing/demoting talented writers who did nothing but solid work for the site. Many of the people among the most recent wave of disappointed, disillusioned current and former Bleacher Report-ers are among the people who helped re-shape the public perception of the website from a content farm (which, in some ways, it still is) to a hub for thought-provoking, original columns and stories (which it is also).

The company has hired big names like Howard Beck, Kevin Ding, Mike Freeman, Jason Cole, Ethan Skolnick, and others as lead writers. These hires have helped the credibility of the site, but in bringing in all these big names at contracts that I can only imagine are extremely lucrative, B/R has done away with the old business model that allowed writers to work their way up into real, respectable jobs at the site.",Respect the people who did the grunt work to help build your platform from a laughing-stock of the industry to one of its biggest juggernauts.,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

There's the yearly 2-5% bump, but that puts average incomes way, way below what comparably employed workers in SF make.

Management almost never promotes, and it's a boys club that ""innocently"" bullies lower staff, knowing that they're keeping the staff captive. When a negative glassdoor review goes up, there have been known to be witch-hunts.

You'll build excellent digital media skills and work with some of the most talented people in the industry.,"They can afford to pay extremely low salaries (compared to the industry) since a lot of people are desperate to break into sports media. Salary distribution is unfair on not relative to industry standards. Very little growth opportunity. Instead of splitting up weekend hours, certain staff get normal M-F schedule while others work every weekend all year. Other companies usually have a rotation. People who put in more effort and time were not padded on the back or paid more (would get same bonus as the people who clocked out).","To retain the talented staff, make salary distribution more fair. Create a firmer rotation regarding the schedule-- certain people shouldn't never work on the weekend (in the other office) while others always do (management would say they do have a rotation but it has huge holes and it exempts a large group of selected people). Re-evaluate who's in management roles. Just because you were hired 6 years ago doesn't mean you should be a 'manage.' Dorth is a great guy who means well, is extremely ambitious and reaches out to everyone (regardless of where they stand). His good nature allows certain things slide, like people working from home all the time. When someone anonymously questioned leadership on their team, Dorth was rightly concerned but his questioning of his managers regarding the anonymous statement led to a witch-hunt on the team instead of fixing the issue (I forget what it was).

Great people, great company, great atmosphere. I left to pursue a new career because I wanted to try something new, but it was very difficult to leave BR. I felt like I was treated well, and learned a lot from some really smart people. And as a sports fan, I was able to enjoy sports during the day, which was a definite plus. I also personally enjoyed having the support of a big company Turner - opened up the possibilities for what we could do and how we could grow. The office itself is also great. I realize it will be difficult to find a work environment like B/R again.","I think the only thing for me would be that a lot of the people who I had gotten to know over my time there had gone on to pursue new things, so a lot of fresh faces in the office. I think that's just a natural part of any company, especially a relatively young but growing one, to have people come and go. And often those people leaving were doing so for good opportunities within the company, like some people moved from SF to NY or London but remained at BR. For others, they had just reached a limit of what they could do at BR - which again I don't think is a strike against BR, but just that the kind of people they hire are go-getters. So it was natural for those people to move on. And i definitely liked the people who were still there, as I mentioned the people are one of the best parts of the company. But as someone who had been there a while, the office was maybe a little less familiar than when I had first started, when the company was a smaller startup.","I would maybe splurge on engineering talent, which I know is difficult and competitive in the Bay Area, but that's where the big opportunity is to me.

The job is in a good part of SF, and is Bart-accessible.","The cons are quite severe. Bleacher Report pays considerably below market value in the Bay Area, and in order to get away with this, management treats you like you are subhuman. They make you feel worthless, and thus not worth decent wages. Whenever questions about the low pay are brought up, management says that there are 200 people lined up for your job, so they don't need to pay you. This is why so few people who work at B/R live outside SF. They simply cannot afford to live in the city they work in.

Additionally, upper management is a boy's club, and they parade around like gods while the hundreds of lower level employees sacrifice their lives and their families to miserable hours and wages. Occasionally they'll throw in a ""free"" t-shirt or something to keep morale up.

BR has all these big goals but doesn't have the technical knowledge or amount of bodies to do what they want. Understaffed and being underpaid is a very dangerous mixture which causes for a tremendous amount of uneccessary stresses. The company would rather spend thousands on unused monitors and televisions than give their employees a bump to the national average. Now the real problem has always and will always be pay. That is the reason you see all these negative reviews, nobody is happy here. There's a passive aggressive undertone in everyone's actions. Your direct managers usually know little to nothing about helping you achieve your salary goals but very RARELY does that happen. They'd rather you leave your position so they can hire someone willing to take your spot for less money. There lies the huge problem, recent college grads lack the experience to successfully carry BR to the next level.

You can imagine the kind of effect this kind of talent drain has had on the culture. Bleacher Report used to be a fun place to work. Now the people who still work there describe it as a ""tomb"" or a ""library."" Everyone has their headphones in all the time. No one socializes. No one looks forward to coming in.

There is absolutely no reason for any designer, engineer, product manager, or QA person worth their salt to consider this company. You get all the soul-crushing constraints of ad-supported business with none of the benefits of a fast-growing Silicon Valley company.

The beer, snacks and laid back environment is all a diversion. Take that away and you are left with an extremely untrustworthy, cheap and horribly mismanaged company. Management does not reward hard work or even good work, but rather the employees that are buddy buddy with the fraternity-like group of overpaid and under-qualified managers who have been grandfathered into their positions since the startup days (before Turner bought the company).

Promotions and fair compensation is hard to come by. Temporary employees are promised full-time employment, yet are hired then fired repeatedly every sports calendar year to save money. The company is not loyal to their full-time employees and will fire you without notice if they choose.

The video department specifically is very divided. Management is passive aggressive and refuses to address or fix any of these problems. The underlying theme at Bleacher Report is that the product must thrive at the expense of the employee.

Smart, motivated coworkers. Despite working remotely, we all have a good rapport.

Time off requests are flexible and easy to get; management generally never says no.

Company has grown since its start-up days and writing quality has gotten better, making articles smoother edits.","Some of the pros are just as easily cons. If you work remotely, you can be at a disadvantage because you often don't find out about meetings you'd like to attend or promotions you could've gotten until it's too late. It's also hard if you like in-person socializing with your coworkers on a regular basis.

Management never says no to time off, sure, but then sometimes when they let too many people off on one day, they get annoyed when you can't come to work because you've already made plans yourself. Have been pressured into working at least once when my team was short on coverage because three people were out. Schedule can change constantly, and some coworkers will not cover for you when needed, but then expect it for them. Others won't stay one minute past the end of their shifts or demand better days off even when they've been at the company less than a year.

Low turnover, so may be hard to advance into a position you want.

Company does not always respect writers, and with Turner acquisition, someone who grew within the company and turned in great work as a featured columnist (as I did) may be passed over because someone who works for The New York Times was recruited.

As an intern we are encouraged to not just cover the sports and events we are assigned, but to write as much as possible about those sports moments, athletes, or concepts that we are passionate about. The site allowed us, as writers, to not just view the number of reads and comments from readers, but also respond to our readers' comments, which was especially helpful in learning what we were doing right or wrong based on audience reception.
Though I especially enjoyed writing about my favorite sports, it was a thrilling type of challenge to be taken out of my comfort zone and have to write about a variety of sports. For example, though I am not so well-versed in soccer, I was given assignments to cover World Cup events, which I believe has ultimately broadened my writing ability. Also, I found that the Internship coordinators and staff were incredibly welcoming and useful. In addition to the feedback I received after almost every article I wrote (over 75), I was encouraged to discuss any questions or concerns with my editors. They made it clear early on that they were not their to baby-sit us, but instead to be a resource, and sure enough they were exceptional.","The internship is online, which has its benefits and downfalls. I really liked the fact that I could do my writing from anywhere, whether at home, in the library or at a cafe. But at the same time, that one-on-one, face-to-face element was missing.

I've trained for other sports writing internships but quickly fell off the wagon due to a lack of feedback, structure, and supervision.

By the end of the internship, most of the interns either quit, or seriously thought about quitting. The whole reason I did this was to get meaningful feedback on my work, but all I got back in my reviews most of the time were thoughtless comments. They made it very clear towards the end of the internship that our value was strictly in our ability to get the website hits. Each week got a little more disorganized and a little more aggravating until most of the interns just wanted to quit.",If you're an upstart website hoping to become legitimate by recruiting good writers (you have to be embarrassed with the content the website produces right now) be sure not to piss off top young sports writers from some of the best schools around the country. I've already told all of my friends in the field to avoid this internship and have contacted my career services to tell them to stop advertising your internship as I found it to be a ridiculously unorganized experience.,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.5,

Your trainer is constantly in contact with you, gives really detailed feedback and is open to any and all questions (even the stupid ones you think no one has ever asked before). You're autonomous during the editing process. They really do trust you to hit the ground running after the initial training process.","Monotony of work; you've got a quota to reach and so it's just go go go during your shift. As it's remote, there's just you and the computer. The feedback is very detailed with all the mistakes you missed during your edits, which can be disheartening, but it's never ever nasty. But if you snag a good trainer, it'll be tempered with good praise hopefully.",,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0

You get a lot of readers and a small following working for Bleacher Report.,Your name has to be attached to Bleacher Report. The company has only a few employed writers. Those that are employed are all asked to write on a few breaking news article topics and pump out a bunch of articles about it. This in turn floods search engines like google and makes bleacher report on top of the search results. This is how they get so many viewers. If you want to be a sports writer this is not the place to get your start because most places after will not take you seriously.,It is a nice concept to let fans write about sports but flooding the internet is not the way to get your company taken seriously. Find the talented writers and hold onto them. Do not pay writers that just know a little about a lot of topics.
