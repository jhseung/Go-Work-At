* The people are, universally, both kind and brilliant. There's a lot of interesting cross-pollination between teams (NLP engineers explaining interesting problems to frontend and vice versa, etc.), and a sense of mutual _respect_ between teams, too. No one team comes across as first-class citizens; everyone's in it together.
* The core product is remarkable, both quantifiably effective and delightful to use. And Textio is thinking beyond the original domain of job listings and working toward augmented writing as a platform.
