2016-08-16, Capture Manager,"Arlington, VA",Current Employee ,Business Development Group,Business Development Group,0,"I came from having worked for a intermediate to a large business and I must say that working for a small business such as C3 Systems has been refreshing. C3 has given me the opportunity to learn all aspects of the business inside and out, build strong relationships with employees of all levels. Management has afforded me the opportunity to diversify my skill set by giving me the opportunity to participate in new projects (i.e. marketing campaigns, new product launch, and project executions. In addition, C3 is also a very flexible workplace (telework, PTO, etc.).

There is new management in place and I would say that some of the old negative reviews on glassdoor are no longer applicable to C3 Systems.",None that I can think of.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

They provide 401lK matching and for a small business in this competitive market, it's welcoming to see that they kept this benefit. The projects teams are consistently going above and beyond to assure successful transition and deliverables are meet, on-time with within budget.","To the best of my ability, none.

2016-04-06,,,Former Employee ,"It's not a question of ""if,"" but ""when.","It's not a question of ""if,"" but ""when.",0,"At this point there are none that I can think of. They used to have Smartrip benefits, but I was told they revoked those. The health insurance used to be pretty good, and was company paid, but when I was there the ""free"" insurance was a high-deductible and the OK insurance was expensive.","Where to begin?

I worked for C3 for several years and through it I have endured incompetent managers/co-workers, nonsensical company directives, and a hostile work-environment.

The final straw, for me--and what made me leave--is when my former manager would not listen to the expertise of his team. People with YEARS in the field. He assured us that his master's degree made him smarter than any one of us ""could possibly know,"" and we were easily replaceable ""within two weeks."" At that point I had checked out of C3 as an active employee. I simply stopped caring and began to go through he motions. I had tried, and tried, and tried for several years to make them see the light and to give them ideas of how we could grow as a company and I was rebuffed every time. C3's MO seems to be to only listen to people with PMPs. If you don't have a PMP, you're not worth listening to. Well, after listening to their PMPs, the company has reduced its work-force by (at least) half, and now there is talk of having to move the office to a smaller location in Crystal City and contracts have all but dried up.

They have a BD team, but it's very small, incompetent and they haven't been awarded a contract in, at least two years. They don't do the legwork to build great proposals. They simply regurgitate past proposals and ""swap out"" the vital information. That's if they can go after a contract. Usually they can't, because C3 has no real past-performance, yet they will only concentrate on large, high-dollar contracts, instead of building a solid portfolio of smaller contracts. The only work they have left is, almost, exclusively HUD-related work that they have had for years.

With all these factors, I see C3 on a downward trajectory and I see no way they can ""come back"" from it. The money is not there, the manpower certainly is not there,and, thus, the expertise isn't there. C3 Systems is an IT company that doesn't know the first thing about IT. This isn't a secret. I have heard high-ranking employees shout it out in exasperation at meetings.

It's a shame, because at one time C3 seemed like it had potential, but after the move to Crystal City, it feels like they bit off more than they can chew and it's been a downward spiral ever since.

At this point, I'll be AMAZED if C3 survives into 2016, let alone beyond. Shame.","What's the point? OK, I'll bite. Listen to the few people you have left and don't run the company into the ground? This is people's livelihoods you're dealing with.",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

There have been some growing pain, but all companies have them. Employees current or old that have negative things to say, seem to only be looking for what the company could do for them, instead of what they can I do to better themselves and the company. All negativity seems to be reviewed as ways to improve but C3. The BD department seem to be running smoother and with more purpose lately. There is a stronger team environment. You can see the great efforts from Management to improve morale and open communication with the teams, by having a company Newsletter, the President has a day weekly that anyone who wants to have a face-to-face meeting with him, anonymous surveys are being done, monthly gift cards for employee birthdays are being send out, and I am sure there will be more things to come. I haven't been here long but if I can see the effort put forth by C3 Systems to make their teams happy. Keep up the good work.","The cons that have seen since I've been with the company mainly lie with some of the staff. Some of them seem to believe they are entitled to thing, like teleworking, instead of understanding that this is a place of work, if you are told to work from the office what is the big deal, unless you are using that time to do personal business.

Yes. The 401K is vested from the day one. That’s true. The medical plan is only free for an employee and only HMO.You will have to pay for PPO. Family plans are expensive.

There is a 3 weeks of PTO for all. But they will not pay you any unused PTO when you leave and they will not let you take any PTO after your resignation is submitted. Beware!

The benefits used to be a notch better. It is all changing now since company is cutting every corner they can.

There is a history of the forced vacations or unpaid leave due to the weather conditions or contract issues.

The company has no defined growth and development strategy. Aside of some heavily inflated past performances there is nothing to offer that would position them on the market as a desired business partner.

They have a huge overhead that is roughly the one fifth of all workers. Don't expect a competitive salary since they have to pay numerous of corporate staff.
