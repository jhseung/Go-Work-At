CDEs are worth their weight in gold and will continue to be needed in excess as the diabetes health crisis continues along with the explosion of technology used to treat diabetes, Type 1 and Type 2.","If you are even considering for one second putting your career, family and health on the line for this disorganized ""start-up"" that is going down faster than anyone wants to admit, then please stop reading this and move on to the next job opportunity. This company is the biggest contradiction to the Core Values it claims to live by than anything in the business world I have ever seen. Their incompetent lack of efficiencies and respect is quite frankly disgusting. The inefficient and hostile work environment includes being under a microscope 24 hours a day 7 days a week. It never ends and it will never be good-enough. There is no trust, and no adoption of new ideas. Be prepared to be on video calls ALL DAY long and into the evening. You must be an extremely amiable and agreeable individual with no bright ideas to be welcomed here. There is not an ounce of work-life balance, whether you have a child or a sick relative or get diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, it can't get any colder at this place. For a company that prides itself on caring about the physical and mental health of it's patients, it will run your own health right into the ground.
It is just really too bad that the leadership is full of unequipped egos that are constantly stepping on each other that this organization will never get their act together, and they've about run out of time.

It’s is not only annoying, it is also inefficient and ineffective. Check the turnover rates of employees and you have proof of this problem. Ask anyone in the company (in confidence) what they think of the CEO’s management style, and you will learn the truth of the dysfunctional nature of the company.

There was definitely a team spirit although we all worked remotely and I enjoyed the talking heads meetings we had weekly.,Technology difficulties made the job frustrating when I blocked off my work hours and spent 1.5 hours logging in or reporting a problem to IT almost every day. There were no problems with any employees or managers. They were all professional and all worked their tails off. I couldn't continue to barely make any money because of system problems.,"Thoroughly test new computer systems before making employees use them. I have a feeling this has improved in recent months, however. Be sure that the Spanish-speaking and English-speaking lists are divided before handing them to the English-speaking CDEs. It shouldn't be a requirement to filter out non-English speakers when the CDE is paid to onboard and educate clients. This is a waste of time for the employee and makes it too difficult to reach their goals. The mission of the company is excellent. The staff is excellent.
