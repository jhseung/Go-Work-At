If you do a good job you will be able to advance and they will appreciate your job and make sure you stay ! You get to do a lot of things and learn how to wear different hats.

New CEO is on his way in and will definitely improve the organization. It's an exciting time to join TWC,","Some of the upper level managers, directors, and VPs, have different visions and conflicting goals for the organization, thus creating a lack of direction sometimes. Some people in managerial or director positions don't have any management or HR training and don't know how to properly manage staff. If you were in academics you might get burned out quickly.",Keep hiring young smart and motivated people because you have a great team. Don't sacrifice the morale of the organization and employees just because a VP or director can supposedly get results.

The mission of the organization is fundamentally awful though and it becomes apparent with each passing academic semester.

Show More","Inability to change and improve despite annual staff feedback. I have given up hope now, the same complaints made before I started here are still ongoing.

Top executive staff stuff their bank accounts and fund their vacations from exploited student money.

Current and outgoing CEO/Mitch McConnell turtle twin ran this organization into the ground and is having his vampire squid Goldman Sachs buddy replace him in the cushy $400,000+ gig. There was no transparency, internal discussion, or active search for candidate replacements internally or externally.

Lots of cronyism and nepotism (same family heading different departments despite lack of leadership and vision). No one dares speak out against it. If you happen to Google Search the Washington Center, a Washington Post article comes up outlining the practices and shady board dealings that summarize what this place is about.

Entry staff will be chewed up and worked to the bone and receive no benefits or livable income for the first part of their time at TWC. High turnover at every level besides senior directors and up. It was and still is a policy for some staff to worked 37.5 hours for the beginning of their time here so they don't qualify for benefits.

Lots of hypocrisy with reputation and relationships here. TWC does not consider cultivating a positive atmosphere a priority. The best thing to do is put on a blindfold and pretend to be friends with senior management and look for jobs elsewhere.","BBQs and baseball games every once in a while won't solve the main issues with this place. You've received negative feedback for five years and have done nothing but get greedier with the costs of programs and continued lack of support to the majority of staff. Middle to entry level staff are poorly paid and replaceable while deadweight remains in place.
