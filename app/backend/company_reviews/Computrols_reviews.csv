2019-01-26, Employee,"Gretna, LA",Former Employee ,Toxic Work Environment,Toxic Work Environment,0,Passable health plan and 401k. Decent but odd office space.,"Zero training or interest in giving it. Understaffed and unwilling to hire the qualified numbers needed to operate effectively. No maintenance staff, so no matter your position scrub toilets or get a 20 minute scolding about it. Random firings with little or no explanations to remaining staff. High turnover. Reactionary and unstable business practices where sales are king regardless of ethics, stock, or staff to implement proposed contracts. Capricious management and owners that treat employees like indentured servants. And finally, ""parties"" with mandatory attendance.",Some consistency and compassion in management style would go far. Qualified staff numbers and retention needs to be increased to actually get enormous workload done on schedule.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
