2016-10-26, Customer Support Representative,"Miami, FL",Former Employee ,Customer Support,More than a year,0,Great company. The start up atmosphere is wonderful. There is a lot of team work and comradery because the offices are small (not too many employees) compared to a bigger company. The President keeps up with what is going on with the office and tries to be transparent. The pay is good compared to other startups and big companies in Miami.,The Miami office was slightly unprofessional. I had a coworker call me a racial slur several times and we had issues with pay twice. Sales people were getting fired left and right.

2016-07-02, Construction Technician,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,"A great company that puts it's employees first, has an amazing product and turns a profit!",More than 3 years,0,"What can I say? If you want to work for a company that puts it's employees first. WORK HERE. If you want to work for a company that creates a valuable product and service. WORK HERE. If you want a FUN open work culture, autonomy in your job respective on your ability with great pay and benefits per time invested. WORK HERE. Over the last 15 years I've worked for several small and a few large companies. The work environment and general good-will expressed towards employees at Webpass is unparalleled in my experience and instills a great sense of loyalty, camaraderie and pride among all employees.

I've watched this company grow from its home in SF to sprawling across several cities across the US and our product, services, talents and leadership improve exponentially over this time period; the company has truly become a potent force in the market.","Some people have complained that management is green, and while yes this may be true in some instances it's actually been a blessing. Managers are molded with Webpass' values in mind, they don't bring along years of ingrained managerial baggage from previous employers. As a non-manager my best advice to those having issues is to work with your managers - find out what their needs are and they'll do the same for you.

I do wish there was more opportunity within each city, however the reality here is that you can easily create and pursue a career path if you actually TRY. Just have patience and an open mind.",Keep doing what you're doing!,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0
2016-03-23,,,Former Employee ,"Great Place to learn, But they have a lot to learn themselves",,0,"Webpass will take a chance on a new employee without the required skill set, although sometimes this isn't always a good thing.

Fun active environment, cool coworkers.","Inconsistency in management decisions, feels as though every manager at webpass has never been a manager at any other company. And the lack of experience causes a lot of inconsistencies. What may be correct one day can be incorrect the next day, you never know and it depends on who you speak to.

If you don't work in SF expect to not be noticed, Webpass will take care of the HQ, but when it comes to a satellite office they put on blinders. You shouldn't have to fight for the same benefits as HQ, employees should be equal across the board regardless of location.

Finances control is terrible, more often than not a large part of the financial burden falls on the employees. I shouldn't have to reach for my credit card every time the office needs something.",,3.0,,,,,

Management is green and there are so many politics that eventually you will get eaten alive.

The managers are awesome all around too.","The company is constantly investing in the future (which goes in the Pros column), but it is sometimes at the expense of some of the fringe perks like a fully stocked drinks fridge.
