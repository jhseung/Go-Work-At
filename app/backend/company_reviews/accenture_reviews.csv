You get hired if you have a network. Simply applying to the jobs on the intranet gets you nothing - not even a response. There is staff in place to help you find jobs (Talent Fulfillment Specialists), but my experience (and of my colleagues) is that these TFSs do almost nothing for you - even after you reach out to them for help. My manager was completely un-involved in my career. I would set up meetings with him which were mostly general chit-chat. He took no interest in our development and would not follow up when we asked for help managing the workload. The ONLY meeting HE held with ME in my 3 years there was to tell me I was being laid off in a month.

2. Raises are minimal - 0.9 to 1.0%. Base pay is about $10K less than industry average and bonuses are about 4% of your salary. The number of hours you work commands a higher compensation package.

You will also encounter personalities that are caustic. People are constantly being thrown together on new projects without any idea if they'll be able to gel.

Purports to be ""Truly Human"", but that truly exists in HR powerpoint decks.

If a solution does not fit in a slide deck, it is not a solution.

The technical ability of most managers and senior managers is abysmal at best; and the firm prevents technically adept people from operating across more than one technology lane; preferring one person to one technical lane so that it can bill for more body's.

Poor starting salary
“Fraternity” mentality
Poor representation of diversity and inability to try to learn and respect other cultures","Practice active leadership and lead teams through action not word, stop targeting employees to fail, don’t terminate employees on the basis of them pursuing higher education.

Much of the management at this particular Accenture office (ASIS - Orlando, FL) indulge in a fraternity mentality of leading. Honestly, it is borderline used car salesmen thinking. If you do not fit in (white male with the exception of one team leader) you will not move up to management. Please do not let others know that you plan further your education or even get certifications as that will give ASIS basis for termination. FLORIDA IS A RIGHT TO WORK STATE. Employers can fire employees AT WILL. Honestly the whole ASIS operation feels shaky. ASIS will recruit recent science major grads with little to no experience in programming and give them on the job training. This training comes with threats of paying back money (approx. $3000 worth of training) if you leave the job in under a year. There are plenty people with health issues and these people are discriminated against when taking on new projects despite a great work ethic and product track. There is a significant amount of work to be done to create a safe space for minorities. WARNING—There is a TARGET on MINORITIES at this company (especially African Americans) . I am warning those interested in this position. It is a trap to continue working in the IT field. It is very difficult to get out of this field once entered. In addition, much of the management have only certificates of completions from online universities and DO NOT understand much of the scientific reasoning and depth that true scientist possess. After being terminated from my position at Accenture ( for rumors of me applying to medical school —which where true) I found another job directly in my field as a chemist that pays $20k more than my position at Accenture. My point is there is better out there and if you do take this position try your best to find a 6 month lease and work while looking for a new job. Gratefully, I landed on my feet and am enjoying the splendors of my hard work in a new environment until I start medical school this July. I wish you all the best.",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

9- If you survive accenture you can survive anything else.","1- Very competitive, if you are 3 top consultants and there is a place for promotion for 2 managers, you might watch your colleagues get a promotion while you stay in your place. The promotion budget is fixed and shared with bonuses. More bonuses to leadership mean less promotions.

2- Lead by fear culture, the person higher than you in hierarchy can think that you are his slave. Everyone is afraid of everyone.

3- Back-stabbing culture: they can promise you for a promotion or a project but once you agree, they will change their mind last minute and might give a promotion to someone stronger than you politically.

4- People are so arrogant, since they are afraid of each other, they need to talk about how successful they are and how important they are even if they are not. Culture of money, fear and power.

5- Money, M O N E Y, that's it. They do everything for money, and they tell you. Selling project without value is fine if the sales is big. 90% of Accenture culture is money driven and you see it in the first day. Believe me.

6- Dictatorship culture. As said the boss decides and he is a dictator thar can ask you to work every night.

7- There is no life, only work. If you need a promotion, forget having a hobby or anything else. I do not have children but impossible to have a child if you are at Accenture!!

8- Jealousy everywhere. Everywhere. People are looking what other people do. No time to collaborate but only to compete and one winner at the end.

9- They ask you to leave (fire you) if they find someone better than you. Not only for
Juniors but they fire Senior Managing Directors too.

10- Fake culture. Yes! You see nice parties and events at work, drinks and foods, but all fake. So people think that Accenture is cool!",I am a simple manager who left Accenture in January 2019.

You may spend 2 months or more doing nothing (often this is them having you sit on a project running tests in circles) and then have a month rush. Information gathering is a tedious chore as you will have to track down who has what information for what you need.
-Unhelpful management - Asking questions will often lead to a very unhelpful response. Often overworked (even when non-management has almost nothing to do), they will turn you away because they are busy. Or you will receive the advice of ""do whatever it takes to get it done"" from the main lead.
-Pay is time based. The longer you work there, the more you can make. But they will not consider raising your pay for performance, so coworkers are often very unmotivated.
-May remove flexible work time

2018-07-24, Business Process Architect,"Arlington, VA",Current Employee ,Great place to start your career,More than 10 years,0,"There are plenty of opportunities across various projects which enable new joiners and analyst to have immediate impact on a project. The company also owns endless resources/assets, including tools and templates to help projects and teams ramp up within a short timeframe. If you land on a great project, you will get manager support and frequent feedback to grow your skills. This is a great place to start one's career (from analyst to consultant). If you work hard, are a self-starter, and are curious you will feel at home. There are smart people to learn from on every project.","Company has changed over the past 5 years. It appears employees have turned to bottomlines on a spreadsheet. There appears to be less focus on the employee as a person. Experiences are shaped by each project, which can vary. Some projects tend to be unhealthy, super competitive and clique-like. At times there is no accountability for how Sr. Managers push resources to work on vacation, late nights, and on weekends. The company as a whole also has to do a better job with minority recruitment and retention. Most people hired are super bright and talented across all groups. However, only a handful of minorities raise through the leadership ladder and it often takes them much longer than most of their counter parts.","I'd recommend spending more time and effort in providing opportunities and support for minorities. There is a gap in the level of support minorities received compared to non-minorities. It starts on projects with who is selected to help on new initiatives. Leadership often pick resources they are familiar with. So unless they come from diverse backgrounds, first picks or mentoring is provided to groups from their own background. I'd consider championing implicit bias training for all managers and above. I'd also provide more guidance and support, including open forum for underrepresented groups to voice their concerns and propose new approaches for inclusion. Often, unless project leadership itself is led by women or people of color, many talented minority resources leave as they don't feel supported or appreciated.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

If you are lucky to be assigned to a project with a lot of funds, you can get the perk of staying at hotels.","If you are a new grad from computer science or engineering, and you have the ability of keep looking for a job, I recommend you to keep looking, unless you are also interested in getting experience in Business. Accenture mixes business, computer science and engineering new grads in the same group and the same level. So it's very probable that you will be assigned something that is more business related and has nothing to with your engineering or computer science degree. You can try and network with managers that are looking for programmers, but since as a new hire you have a very low level, they don't really take you seriously. I'm so bored in my project I feel like flipping tables and quitting.

It also seems that as you gain more experience, the more overworked you get. While I know this can happen almost anywhere, it's especially bad for managers and team leaders. The managers are in so many meetings all day they barely have any time to eat or take small breaks. I know many people that come at 7:00am and stay until 7:00pm. Many people eat at their desk because they don't have enough time to take their lunch hour. It is very depressing.

It also seems that Accenture is starting to underpaid their new hires. I'm aware of this because in the training we found out that the new hires from last year had been offered 20k more than us. My salary didn't get adjusted when I moved to the New York Offices. So if you don't want to get overworked, underpaid and assigned a project not relevant to your degree, ignore Accenture. For a Global Consulting Company that makes billions of dollars each year this is very cheap from them.","Mixing business, computer scientists and engineering it's not efficient because they have a very different skill set and possibly different interest. If you assign a computer scientist or engineer degree something they're not interested in, they probably won't be as motivated and won't perform as good as they could. Actually invest in your new hires by giving them programming and technology training. New hires are excited to learn things that peak their interest and they will probably perform better if they can get the opportunity to work on something they like.
Actually offer competitive salaries. The compensation Accenture is offering its not even in the median amount of the job type. As a company that keeps advertising themselves in being in the forefront of technology, it is not up to pair with the standards of big tech companies.

As far as centralized User Research, there is only one small group of less than 10 people I've been able to find in my 2 years here.

Accenture does not encourage self-improvement and learning. They say they do, but if you are on a billable project, it is extremely difficult to get approval. Essentially, they expect 100% of your time to be spent on billable hours. If you want to improve your skill-set, you're expected to do that on your own time, even though it will benefit Accenture in the end.

Mentorship is incredibly difficult to find. You can find mentors, but any time spent mentoring or being mentored cannot be logged in place of billable work. Therefore, again, you're expected to mentor/be mentored ""in your spare time.""","Centralize UX expertise

Some decent and genuine people.,"Let's see here. First, to be clear, I was with federal services, so I was a federal contractor.

We entered a period in which we had to rebid for a contract. Normal. Happens with regularity in federal work. In fact, you might go so far as to say people know when they have to rebid! (because they do). Well, when time for us approached, the entire joint took the air of a chicken slaughterhouse. Headless chickens everywhere. Leadership said initially, it will be two months! Meanwhile they stopped hiring people, stopped doing travel, stopped doing everything that they couldn't charge to the client (save for a few things that I'll get to later). I don't want to write an essay, but my point is that no one was prepared. What was supposed to be 2 months ended up being almost 8.

This place is gaga about diversity. They will literally pay out a higher bonus the more diverse someone is. Maybe that's normal, but it is repugnant. They want half of the workforce to be women by 2020 or something like that. They also want many more women managers. Men, who lack diversity cred, think about what this means for your promotion potential at the company.

Unqualified managers. A mentor pointed out to me that a manager can be very successful and not be a leader. Boy is that true. The only ""leaders"" are executives. I don't mean that in what I experience, I mean that I never heard a manager be referred to as a leader. For what I said in the second paragraph, you get some really, really bad managers. People who hit the promotion elevator, not by being good at their job and capable of managing a group of people well, but for other reasons. And since they're not terribly great at their job and bad at managing, they stay at the company.

Weird diversity oriented programs. I've never seen so many special events and days set aside at a company for diversity events as I have at AFS. They won't spend AFS money on their employees, but they will hire out fancy halls for IWD.

Unwillingness to develop technical skills. Sure, sometimes the best way to learn a program is ""hands on"" but when the ""hands on"" system is live and essential, should you really have people figuring out things as they go along? If you ask for a book or training you will get told that they either don't have budget, or that you can ask and they'll see what happens. Meanwhile peers you work with get sent to classes. And speaking of books, people have a weird hang up about not using them.

Lack of commitment to people. Friends of mine moved hundreds of miles and across several states to work where we did. Oh look we lost the contract and we knew we were, and now you're ""on the bench"" but don't worry! AFS takes care of people who are on the bench. As long as they're above entry level, that is.",Hire good people. Promote good people. You will lose less contracts this way.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Accenture does not always look for the best roles to fit what their people want, but instead place them where there's an opening. Also, the requirement to travel should be more of an as needed basis. People get burnt out with the monotonous travel and should have more flexibility to work remotely 25% of the time.

Don't really think you can have a working spouse and manage the travel with children.

2018-04-25, Software Engineer,"Redwood City, CA",Former Employee ,Dysfunctional Teams and Leadership Lacking Empathy,,0,"I am based out of the Liquid Studio in Redwood City which has a very nice office and perks like snacks and standing desks.

Initially, I enjoyed my time there and appreciated how the whole team at the Studio used to go out for lunch together and try to get to know each other better.

Other employees go through the same struggles, so it's nice to be able to connect with them on that. I have made friends here.

Accenture pays for travel to clients and the occasional dinner outing.

Got free access to an onsite gym with a pool.","Over time, the experience at the Studio has degraded a lot, and many people are reconsidering staying here over a year.

Just within the last few months, I've witnessed a couple of people leave already to look for a new job with myself included earlier this year.

Very low pay compared to area's standards.

Unsaid expectation to work overtime w/o overtime pay to make outrageous deadlines and not complain about it.

Lack of minority engineers and women (in leadership) is pretty tragic.

I don't feel the new leadership is very effective at connecting with the rest of the studio which mostly consists of lower level analysts (lack of empathy, no interest in understanding).

There is very little transparency given to analysts at the Studio as to what projects are going on or what the long-term plans are.

Even though there are less than 50 people at the office, I don't see a lot of cross-project team collaboration or communication.

Participation in Studio Sessions and social outings is much lower than before.

Feels like we have to put on a show on every time a significant client came around to prove we are the best only because of our office floor plan.

Projects with clients always ended up being cut short because they decided to go with a cheaper option or extended to the point of frustration and pulling out of hair because of disorganization in the software development process and politics.

Clients would blame most issues on Liquid Studio team instead of off-shore.

My managers were decent, but I heard horror stories from a co-worker about another manager who was very msyongstic. Thankfully, he left too.

Employees are constantly referred to as ""resources"" and treated as such - without a shred of empathy for their personal lives and only seen as a source of productivity.

Pretty sure if I compared pay between managers and analysts at the Studio, there would be a HUGE pay gap even though analysts end up doing the most work.","Don't talk down to lower level employees.

Don't make overly optimistic deadlines and expect employees to work overtime every day for you.

Create an internal culture that everyone can be excited about.

Don't make everything about the leadership because they're the only ones who end up participating.

Make deals with clients who don't treat employees like third tier citizens.

Leadership needs to be more empathetic and have the ability to connect with more people at the Studio.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
