They do not pay on time. When you complain, they terminate your contract without notice. Unfortunately for them, they burn the bridge with the client too--I know my client will never hire them again. They need to understand the consultant is your bread and butter--not the company the client serves--and treat them better. Pay more, pay regularly. Offer REAL benefits for the 25-30% cut of pay you take from consultants. Reward them for finding their own work! They aren't going to be around for long in my opinion. These types of agencies are being consolidated and have no real business model except to use the consultant to make a margin. Short sighted, and not very nice.",,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
