Hiring from the business world can be great - we need diversity and strong skills - but operating like a corporation in a cold way is not what we came for.

People deeply cared about making the world a better place and were doing everything possible to make that happen. You woke up excited to go to work because your coworkers were your family, and you were all in it together to truly change lives. There was absolutely no better work environment out there! Everyone wanted to work for Kiva, and you felt deeply appreciative if you were one of the ""lucky"" ones who landed a job. The salary was low, but you knew that working for a nonprofit, and everyone was okay with it because the culture and outstanding benefits made up for the difference in salary that you could be making at a for-profit in the Bay Area.","The new CEO has sadly changed everything. Rather than recognizing that the problem was with a lack of strategic direction from management, the CEO blamed all problems on staff. He is bringing in tons of people from the outside with no input from the current team and taking away responsibilities from current talented staff, giving all new projects to outside contractors. He claims ""new"" ideas as his own instead of recognizing that lower level staff have been working on these ideas for years and just never had management give them the green light to make them happen. The new exec team is largely very corporate and doesn't show signs that they are authentically there for the mission. It is run like any other tech company now and focused on technology, technology, technology instead of the mission (if people wanted to work for the latest technology, they could make 2x the salary at basically any other company in the Bay Area, so this is ridiculous). There is no input from the staff and existing Kiva users on how things can improve. Instead, it's the ""we need to revamp everything"" approach in order to be more like Amazon, Facebook, etc.

Half the staff has turned over in the last ~12 months. Terrible morale that is not acknowledged by the exec team despite constant attempts to get them to talk about it. All people that are still there that aren't recent hires are looking for new jobs.",Your team is your most valuable asset.

-Interesting mix of tech and nonprofit.

-Warm and welcoming people trying to do good in the world.","Kiva was an incredible place to work for a long time. Unfortunately new management doesn't have the skills or desire to retain what was so great about it, namely the culture and mission.

-Extreme top-down approach - Direction and ideas come from the CEO only, not even other management team members, let alone the wider organization. New ideas and projects are not collaborative, information is hoarded, and people do not look out for one another anymore.

-Huge recent turnover - There was a mass exodus in 2018 under the new CEO, who has taken an extremely top-down, hierarchical and un-transparent approach. A few good people remain, but most are trying to leave.

-Heart gone from leadership - Much of the mission-driven management left under new leadership and the new CEO replaced them with mercenaries. New management has no relevant background leading to poor decision making.","Listen to your staff! Valid, innovative ideas can come from anywhere and anyone.

Everyone who works there is driven by a passion for helping people, for making positive change in the world. It's a young crowd with a lot of energy and zest. They are earnest and always looking for ways to improve systems, always focused on how to better serve borrowers and lenders. The mission is incredible and everyone is bought in. Work-life balance is amazing, with flexible hours and options to work from home on certain days if you need to. The benefits are generally fantastic, with an option to take a trip to visit a field partner every other year.

I feel honored to have worked there, and will always cherish that experience -- there's really no place like Kiva.","Transparency is a core value at Kiva, but sometimes I felt it went overboard. It's not that transparency is necessarily a bad thing, but the culture of transparency sort of led to an overly democratic structure with too many stakeholders involved in every decision, which makes it difficult to be efficient. Leadership in general was weak, although they've gone through a period of transition at the top for a few years now which is probably the reason, so hopefully the new CEO is helping. If you want to work in nonprofits, you're obviously not driven by salary, but it seemed like Kiva is on the low end even for nonprofits. Kiva also relies on interns to keep running, and these interns swap out every 4-6 months. That means that you're retraining people, explaining basic things from scratch, and maybe shifting responsibilities based on intern competencies every 4-6 months. It can be difficult to plan and grow with this system. There are not a lot of growth opportunities at Kiva -- coupled with the low salaries, that leads to a lot of turnover even though everyone seems to love it there.",The quarterly priority initiatives system needs to go :),4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
