2015-02-06,,,Former Employee ,"Don't work here, too many internal problems that won't be resolved anytime soon","Don't work here, too many internal problems that won't be resolved anytime soon",0,Meeting people in the community and sometimes helping them,"Weird race issues. Most upper leaderships white and- working in non-white communities, and tokenized blacks and Latinos. Trotted them out for pictures but not let them have much say in what's happening. Senior staff surround themselves (including board) with ""yes men"" so if you want to stay, you better be a yes man too. Part of the job is stroking the executive director's (immense) ego. They also blatantly, routinely, stole credit for other community's organization's campaigns and tried to take them over so they could claim it as ""their"" campaign and get more grant money. Really unethical but I kept my mouth shut for fear of getting fired, but it has such a bad rep in the community. It's unfortunate, because they could do a lot better. They have a lot of resources that could do so much good, but they operate in sneaky and unethical ways and burn so many people and communities. Goals are really good, but way they are doing things is bad.","Have people on the board and senior staff that encourages diversity of opinion. The board should pick staff leadership who are representative of the communities being organized - Latino, black. It's the board's responsibility to make sure the organization is ethically and responsibly led.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
