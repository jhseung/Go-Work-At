The company is full of very motivated and friendly people.,The cons are the same for most contracting companies. You don't always know your management that well and you don't have many opportunities to get to know the other employees.,Some other companies meet with new employees in person before they start working at the customer's location.

2016-05-13, Health Promotion,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Great Company- Innovative Management Team,Great Company- Innovative Management Team,0,"I love working for Venesco. Senior leadership is focused on growth & employee engagement. My local management is a true champion for our program and for every employee on the team. She is always seeking out opportunities to develop our skills and support us in any way possible. With her leadership, we have been able to produce, innovative, and much needed products to support health promotion efforts on the local command that we work with. Our team has been given the opportunity to bring the military's health promotion efforts to the 21st century to match leaders in the healthcare industry and we are producing fantastic work! Its truly exciting to be working for Venesco on this project and to have the opportunity to support the military in this way. I have worked in several different professional fields and work teams and I enjoy this team the most, I attribute this to management's ability to hire professionals with diverse backgrounds, dynamic personalities and the ability perform at a high level despite any challenges that may come our way.","Government inefficiency can slow projects at times. Unfortunately, many government workers have limited or no experience working in the civilian sector and lack perspective when presenting new ideas or ways to challenging the status quo to make products or systems for efficient & effective. Technology within the government systems can also limit innovation ability.","DISREGARD THE NEGATIVE REVIEW LISTED ABOUT VENESCO. That was from a disgruntled employee who did not understand a modern, tele-commute work environment, how to work within a team of smart-creatives and the value to being part of a team, where each individual brings a unique skill-set to the table in the workplace. As for the comments about a team member having no experience in Health Promotion or with the military, that is false. I believe that comment was made in regard to me. Yes, I do hold a degree in Finance, but I also went back to school for Exercise Sciences & Nutrition. I also came to Venesco with 5 years of Health Promotion & Health Education experience in the San Diego market. I also spend several years in a past role working with the military. I happen to teach yoga and live a healthy, active lifestyle, so I think I am EXACTLY the person who should be a health promotion specialist. I took years to change my career toward my passion of health & wellness, garner the necessary experience to be in the role, and I am loving the work that I am now doing to educate the military community about health & wellness.

Continue to hire great leaders, like you have in San Diego, and know that they will continue to make you proud with the exceptional work that they deliver for the government clients.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

The management structure allows me to be autonomous and creative all while being challenged in the best ways possible. My supervisor is a fierce leader who helped mentor me on my path to professional greatness! The team I work with are all highly intellectual, innovative, and warm individuals which makes it easy to want to do my best for not only my company, but for our clients as well.",If you need a lot of managing on a daily basis you may struggle with the environment in which you work.

2016-05-13,,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,A place to challenge yourself by being fully responsible for your work,A place to challenge yourself by being fully responsible for your work,0,"Venesco is the ideal company for someone who likes a fast-paced environment where the ""day-to-day"" tasks are rarely the same. I have never been more challenged, and therefore fulfilled, in my career thus far. Leadership is very supportive but also equally gives you the freedom to own your work. This is jolted my abilities as an employee and I feel like I have gained years worth of experience in only been eight months. Also, Venesco is fantastic at finding and hiring talented smart-creatives. I am on a team where the experience widely varies but the personality types all gel together. I would love to work with these people for the rest of my career!","Being that this position is predominately remote, there are some times where communication takes longer than the ""traditional office"". This is the nature of the beast when working remotely and I absolutely prefer the ability to make my own schedule over being able to go to someone's desk to ask them a question.",Keep hiring smart-creative employees!,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
2016-05-13,,"San Diego, CA",Current Employee ,Pop Health Program - San Diego,Pop Health Program - San Diego,0,"If you are hardworking, intelligent individual who values your own expertise and the expertise of others this is a perfect fit for you. The San Diego team is comprised of overachievers, willing to go the extra mile, or ten, to deliver the best possible deliverables regardless of time or resource constraints or government obstacles. Each individual works just as well autonomously as they do in a group setting and enjoy both equally.

Weekly meetings consist of brainstorming sessions using fishbowl discussion techniques. Ideas are presented and built upon constantly, molding them until the perfect blend of each persons expertise is embedded within them. The best part about these meetings is the Project Manager's ability to keep things high energy and fun without letting anything valuable fall through the cracks. Team building is a huge part of her philosophy and the materials that are rolled out for the ever-changing project showcase exactly what collaboration can do.

Venesco brings a new light and perspective to the military health care system. Best practices, data analytics, marketing psychology and more are all part of what makes their products stand out and makes this team qualified for the job.",The company culture is not be ideal for those who need ample direction and micromanagement. Those who do not work well remotely and have poor time management and/or prioritizing will have trouble.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,
2016-05-10,,"San Diego, CA",Former Employee ,Worst professional experience. Ever!,Worst professional experience. Ever!,0,"If you enjoy being part of a team and working for leadership with integrity, this is not the job for you.","Leadership for the San Diego team had no clue how to work with the government, lacked professional integrity, and seemed more interested in hiring friends than forming a team of qualified professionals. I'm not sure how a team is supposed to execute a population health program for the military and their families when most of the team had no actual health care or military experience - the team included ""health promotion specialists"" with finance degrees or experience teaching yoga. Not the right qualifications for improving the health of people with chronic medical conditions or risk factors for them. One of the few team members who was qualified and experienced was fired by being told her position was being cut even though someone else was immediately hired for the same position. Essentially, leadership lied to her.

Management in San Diego also continually bad-mouthed the government client and other senior company leadership to the entire team, creating a toxic and dysfunctional environment. The focus of the team was continually changing and leadership seemed clueless about what we were supposed to be doing, how to work with government clients, or even how to manage a population health program.

The sense of being part of a team was non-existent as the ""team"" rarely came together as a group (once a week for an hour or so was it), which created silos and limited the ability of the group to function to its full potential. I'm all for telecommuting, but it seems counterintuitive to do so when a team and a project are still forming. Never being onsite meant the team - that pretty much lacked in any military experience - was out of touch with the military population they were supposed to serve and didn't seem motivated to learn. Not sure how you're supposed to implement a population health program when you nothing about the population.

Towards the end of my time there, the team was simply replicating the efforts of the already well established health promotions department - redundancy at its finest.This entire project seemed to be a waste of taxpayer dollars and I wouldn't be surprised if the contract doesn't get renewed.

This was truly one of the worst professional experiences I have ever had. If you truly want to make a difference in the health of military beneficiaries and be part of a cohesive team of skilled professionals, find another job.","Take a good hard look at your team in San Diego. Corporate leadership seemed competent and genuine and the population health concept is great - you just need a team and local management with the professionalism, integrity, skill set, and knowledge of military health and culture to make it happen.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
