2018-12-19,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Incredible Mission + Brilliant People,Less than a year,0,"The company has incredible market fit and an absolutely brilliant leadership team. It's an exciting time to be a part of such a fast growing company where everyone is truly working to have a positive impact on healthcare.

Founders have acknowledged past missteps, but the company is so large now that those seem to be in the past.",It's growing so quickly that you have to be a true self starter to keep up with the pace.,Continue to raise the bar high.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

2018-10-05,,,Current Employee ,"Great Startup, great place to grow",,0,"Incredible benefits
Incredible perks and work environments
Lots of autonomy as long as you get your work done","The company is new, so normal growing pains of getting SOPs, policy, stuff like that, can create some questionable times. Nothing I've seen that would sway anyone from working here though. I love it!",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-07-30,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Growing fast and moving in the right direction!,Less than a year,0,"-Amazing perks and benefits - comparable to what you'd find in a much larger tech company - wellness benefit, commuting benefit, lunches, fully stocked kitchen and lots of team building activities
-Mission and vision that I believe and at my core want to support.
- Opportunity to really make an impact on many levels and really push yourself to achieve amazing things while learning and developing your skills
- The people - rare to find a company where all the people are working hard, genuinely nice and fun to be around
- Flexible work schedule and definitely work/life balance - people work hard here but the company's culture doesn't value micromanagement. Employees have a lot of autonomy and have some flexibility to work from home when needed

The company as a whole is moving in the right direction. They were missteps and mistakes but it seems these are acknowledged, recognized and improvements have been made to resolve some of the issues others have pointed out in their reviews.

I truly believe it's an exciting time to be part of this company and things will only get better.","With growth comes pain and the company is still in maturing. There is still a need for some structure and more clarity on roadmap but this is indicative of working in a fast-paced start-up that is growing very fast.
Communication can be improved amongst those is senior level management - but many are new leaders.",Focus on strategy and improving overall communication. Develop your leaders and given them the tools and training they need to be better managers and leaders. Continue investing in your people and don't lose sight of why you started this business. Also - continue hiring those with experience and proven ability to allow the company to scale and grow.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-06-28,,,Current Employee ,The reviews aren't wrong,,0,Googling Nurx will return numerous articles rating it one of the hottest startups in 2018 and my experience has confirmed exactly that.

2018-06-12, Contractor,,Former Employee ,It's a shame,Less than a year,0,"-Nurx has a really brilliant mission, and has the potential to do such good in this world.

-My colleagues at Nurx were all incredibly hardworking and talented. The team will teach you a lot!","I was brought to Nurx as a contractor, and when my contract was coming to an end and I wanted to know if it would be renewed, Management asked me if this job was ""really about the money for me?"" Not only was this incredibly disrespectful, but it was ironic, considering I was paid a shockingly low rate.

I cannot honestly say the company made decisions that were in the best interest of their users, which I found really disheartening considering the fact that they claim to be mission-focused. We all understand that growth is important and that Nurx is a business, but when you're working with sensitive medication, you'd think ethics would be taken a bit more seriously. At the same time, I often saw leadership treat my colleagues poorly. I hope the culture has improved since then, but from what I've seen online, it doesn't seem like it has.",,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
2018-06-06,,,Former Employee ,Management needs complete overhaul,,0,"Awesome idea, in theory, of how to deliver a much-needed medical services to the populations who need them most. With the glaring exception of the CEO and the co-founder, you'll find some of the nicest, hardest working staff ever.","If you're looking to feel undervalued, underpaid, confused (and even nervous) about where you stand in the company, confused about what your daily tasks are, and what larger goals you're supposed to be working towards, and sometimes outright hostility from the ""management"", then this is your place. The only thing this company ""disrupts"" is your mental health.

Note that the word management is in quotes because there literally is none. HR is minimal to non-existent. God forbid you have a complaint about anything. Good luck with that.

The CEO and co-founder take off for weeks at a time to travel all around the world with no game plan for what needs to happen while they're gone. Deadlines with important outside entities are missed and management doesn't care. One on one meetings do not happen. Hell, any sort of in-person meetings are strained, difficult, and short because everyone has learned not to speak up. The CEO prefers to dictate over Slack, sometimes rudely so. There are zero opportunities for clarification of tasks, and if you ask, most times you'll get a condescending answer if you get one at all. He'll ask for your ideas...don't fall into this trap, as it only leads to frustration and job dissatisfaction. Know that he is not at ALL interested in your ideas, and will never implement anything you suggest. The only team he respects is the Dev team, and its because he fancies himself as a sort of programmer.

Performance reviews are non-existent. Opportunities for advancement are non-existent. Maybe things have improved since I was there, but well-defined job descriptions with clear duties laid out are non-existent. Employees are siloed in their own departments, and no one really knows what anyone else is working on or doing. Communication between teams could use some improvement (although, if asked directly and informally, folks were always willing to discuss what they were working on).

What's really missing from this place is the idea of the bigger picture. What are people actually working towards? What are the bigger goals, and then, what are the smaller day-to-day in-the-weeds steps that need to happen to get there? Management can't answer any of these questions, and as such, a clear direction is lacking. This, of course, leads to really poor employee morale, or at least it did when I was there. I hope, for the sake of the great folks that do work there that things have changed, because I can't imagine anyone could actually enjoy working for the equivalent of a rudderless sinking ship with an arrogant, totally clueless captain.","This is more of a note to current and potential investors...protect your money and get rid of the CEO. As long as he is involved in anything more than holding a title, this company will not succeed. He is incapable of motivating the talented people he hires into doing anything meaningful, because he literally has no idea what he is doing himself. He has no plan, and will be INCREDIBLY resistant and defensive to any sort of feedback or ideas. So much so that any level of disagreement will cause deals to be destroyed and valuable employees to be fired if they speak up. Make no mistake, the CEO is *only* interested in his own wealth and vanity in the start-up community and every decision made will benefit only himself and the co-founder. He'll tell you otherwise, but his actions paint a different picture. He believes deep down that he knows more, knows *better* than everyone, you included. So, protect your cash. Unload him, and put literally ANYONE in his place, so long as they have the desire to build something by inspiring people to work towards a goal that is greater than themselves, instead of ruling with incompetence and blind arrogance.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0
2018-05-30,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Unprofessional, complete disregard for employees, horrible management.",Less than a year,0,"Free coffee, free wifi, sometimes they stock the kitchen.","In the time spent with this company, it was made abundantly clear that any employee that wasn't management is expendable and replaceable. Management is constantly MIA, and things are constantly going up in flames. There is no training process, so when something does go wrong, you should have someone you can ask for guidance or direction. Nope. Management is nowhere to be found, and other employees are playing a guessing game as well or will tell you to completely disregard the issue and let someone else deal with it.

There is no feedback. Management almost never talks to us. Never has one on ones, only communicates via chat. There is no moving up, there's no moving period. They tell you to do something, and you do it. That's it.

They are constantly launching new features and protocols that deeply impact the site and the users, then the other teams have no idea how to respond to it. It's super unorganized.

There is a level of hierarchy within this company that creates a huge dividing line between management and lower level employees. Even if someone has seniority, or holds more knowledge than another person, that puts them in a more respected position than the next person.

It has a very click-y feel to it. You're either one of the valued employees, or you're not. And when you're not, you are invisible and disregarded completely. I wouldn't even go as far to say 'valued', because even when you're one of the 'chosen ones', its made very clear that your position is unstable and you can easily be replaced. Its a horrible, horrible way to run a company.

For the expectations they have of their employees, whether it be workload, hours, or work environment/office morale, the compensation just doesn't hack it. Solely by the way they blatantly have zero regard for their employees makes this company detestable, not to mention the pennies they pay you.","Interact with your team more, answer questions, give feedback, do one on ones. Literally, just do one sliver of anything more in regards to your employees well being and it'll be an improvement. Running your teams like its a sweat shop is ineffective and produces awful results, obviously. Morale is lower than dirt.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

2018-05-27,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Operations,Less than a year,0,Worked with cool people in the operations department . Casual environment as well,There is no transparency here. You never know what is going on and that is a problem. Management is a joke. High expectations for very very low pay. I mean there is a public thread on blind ( anonymous comments about company) about Nurx and there basically says it all about the company culture and it’s pretty bad and alarming . The thread blew up and they tried to do damage control by hiring a company culture person to help and I don’t think there were any improvements . The CEO never said one word to me and seemed snobby . They use to stock the kitchen with food and then they slowly stopped . I think this company is wonderful in terms of what they’re doing for women. However; working here was miserable. Would get home everyday mentally just exhausted and unhappy,"Please learn how to actually manage employees . You should have one on ones with everyone, so employees know how they’re doing.

2018-02-11, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Software Engineer,Less than a year,0,"- A genuinely meaningful mission that is actually improving the lives of our customers. Healthcare is a mess in the US, and we're making it (just a bit) easier for folks.
- Interesting technical challenges to solve. We're an operationally heavy business, so the engineering team needs to figure out how to automate as much as possible. This will increasingly involve machine learning as we move forwards. On top of that, we're still very much in the build phase of our product. There's a lot to work on and take ownership of from a technical standpoint.
- Business is killing it. Achieving growth is not our challenge.
- Down to earth leadership that's engaged, smart, and willing to change and grow with the company. It sounds like there may have been some issues in the past, but I personally haven't seen any.
- Surprisingly good work life balance for a high growth startup. This is more than a 9-5, but it's not all consuming, which I think is VERY rare.

Bottom line: This is the best job I've had so far in my career.","- Cross team communication is getting better, but probably isn't where it needs to be. I think this will resolve itself in the next few month.

Not too much honestly. This place is damn solid.","I think we're in a really strong place going into this year of growth, so I think we just need to execute well.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
