Tuck Shop food is really good. The Wellness Benefit is large and you can use it on a very wide variety of equipment and services. Company matches donations up to a certain amount.

Work Environment
Newish building with many different work areas. Day to day functions are well organized so that you have relatively little administrative unpleasantness. An awesome Dropstop on every floor takes care of IT needs promptly.

Pockets of Engineering Excellence
Some parts of the engineering organization are strong: Magic Pocket, sync, and machine learning stand out. Hack Week lives on.

HelloSign Acquisition
The company may have realized that it is organizationally/culturally not equipped to grow organically and now seems willing to acquire for growth.","Weak Strategic Thinking
""Evolving"" strategy as each year's strategy proved to not work. Each year's strategy is based on models of the industry where either the model is unconvincing or it is not at all clear why Dropbox's approach is the winning one.

Passive Aggressive Culture
People are always friendly face to face but beneath the veneer there is a lot of jockeying for power. Power distribution is evident when prizes projects get done by in power teams even though the area is theoretically another team's area of responsibility. People assign overflow tasks to other people even though they are responsible for it. People initially promise to do work and then shirk it without repercussions.

Politics
Ultimately unsuccessful projects were created and pushed out the door to get people promoted. Many people jump on board early on and generate immediately ridiculous shoddy user research to back up the work. Shallow technology is hyped as awesome and weak initial indicators are seen as good. Many of the promoted people still remain or get promoted even further up to do more damage.

Promotions are based on getting backing from managers and hopping on board initiatives that staff engineers or managers push. Each new set of staff engineers or managers disparages the work of the previous set and advocates for their own work. No one is willing to push back against what they say.

Levels are uneven with some staff or senior engineers/QA who are anything but that. Long time mediocre people are accumulating. Some title inflation for new hires.

The attempt to make the culture more innovative is not working because the people who enforce and benefit from the culture are all still in positions of power.",Keep on acquiring companies.,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0

-Work/life balance

-Benefits
-There are a lot of chances for ownership and a ton of work still to be done.

-The people are great. Dropbox is incredible at finding a diverse range of high quality people.

-Diversity.

-The company culture is very inclusive.

-Still has the feel of a much smaller company.","-People are churning out very fast in the past 9-12mo.

-Busy work is rewarded. A lot of people put out a ton of ""work"", but very little has impact. The volume of work is often used by people to vouch for promotion, bonuses, or transfer to higher roles in other teams.

-Reorgs. The company has had 6 internal re-orgs on teams I have been on since I joined. Imagine working on a project for 6 months, getting everything in line and then leadership decides to do something completely different. This makes it super hard for many people to actually accomplish something start to finish.

-A lot of teams are made up mostly by people who come in through the Dropbox Rotation Program out of school. I find that these teams are highly tribal, not open to criticism, and often do not do very high quality work but know how to play the system very well.

-Peer review process is hit or miss and a lot is open to what feedback your managers choose to include. Moreover if you move to another team you can often be ""re-leveled"" and miss out on promotions or career path opportunities.

-Due to there being so much work to be in certain divisions, a lot of time is wasted on things that have minor impact. On one hand employees milk this because it makes them look like they do a ton of informative work, but on the other hand if you look at things from the big picture we learn slowly and can't scale ideas well.","-Stop reorganizing divisions every few months.

-Invest more in data quality and analytics..

-Stop letting relatively inexperienced or junior staff interview technical candidates with more experience. You miss out on so many amazing candidates because the interviewer is simply not on the candidate's skill or communication level.

-Tuck Shop is cool, but you should trend towards serving healthier options. It becomes patronizing after the initial awe wears off.",2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

2018-08-07, Product Designer,,Current Employee ,"Well-Intentioned, Disorganized, Directionless",More than a year,0,"Benefits and pay are truly excellent. There are generous stipends for transit, wellness, learning and development (books and conferences), and others. Dental, vision, and health are all covered. There is donation matching up to a $1000 per year, unlimited volunteer and paid time off (which, if you're daring enough to request, truly seems unlimited—I have yet to hear of someone's PTO request being declined), and if you're in an office with a Tuck Shop, world-class food served every day. You can gift Dropbox space to friends and family.

The culture values kindness and open-mindedness to a fault, and teams are given massive autonomy to work and ship as they see fit. This means you can have very different experiences depending on your team and manager. This also means if you see something broken, you're generally given the OK to go and fix it if you have the will.

There are company events throughout the year, including team offsites (I've been hiking, on a cruise, to an escape room, and to countless dinners and happy hours), guest speakers, parties, etc. Dropbox seems to spare no expense on events and travel, although I've heard it was even more extravagant in the past.","Dropbox lies squarely in the ""ruinous empathy"" quadrant of business culture. Promotions are measured by the number of friends you make, not the results you achieve, which results in decision making by committee and projects that lag on for months at a time because nobody is willing to take ownership or say ""no."" At the same time, projects spanning 6+ months of research, design, and engineering can be derailed by the opinion of a single manager in the pursuit of ""perfect"" rather than ""better"".

Staff lack a clear vision for Dropbox. Milquetoast strategy updates and new opportunities receive endless bravado but when it comes to actual execution there's little follow-through. Meanwhile, the core Dropbox product continues to suffer from longstanding problems like convoluted sharing and horrendously slow performance.

We use Dropbox Paper, our own docs offering, for absolutely everything—from project management to calendaring to to-do lists to meeting notes. What results is total chaos. There is no sane way to organize docs, which get produced at an astounding rate: product managers regularly compose dozens of new Paper docs in any given week. There is no way we would organize ourselves this way if we weren't so committed to using and abusing our own tool.

Simple bugfixes languish in backlogs for months or years without resolution. Abysmal developer tools and nonexistent analytics slow the company to a crawl.

We talk a big talk about ""designing a more enlightened way of working"" (corporate thinkpieces go up on the blog every few weeks) but how can we hope to improve work for others when our own house is a mess?

All these issues aren't new, and they're well-known to anyone who has been in the organization for longer than a year. We will talk about them and collectively agree they need to be addressed, but for whatever reason, nothing ever seems to happen.","LEAD. Where are you? From down on the ground, seems like you've tapped out. Commit to a direction and see it through. Hold people accountable for results and set real deadlines. Fix the basics.

Standardize from the top down. We aren't a startup anymore, but we still act like one. We need standard platforms and processes across the org for project management, hard requirements for shipping, easily accessible analytics for *all* teams, and a continuous, direct line of communication with customer success so we understand the real problems that users are facing, not the problems we make up for our user personas to face.

Treat remote offices as first-class citizens. There's a lot of thrash that most likely goes unnoticed in SF. Check in to see how people are doing.

- Lack of basic social skills - people don't believe in greeting others in hallways
- Inexperienced and egoistic managers have caused a lot of damage and attrition in the past year
- If you are a person of color, you may not exist for the rest of them for a long time (I am not a person of color, but I noticed the bias against my colored co-workers)
- There still exists a boys club
- Career growth and mentorship is limited
- Don't work at Dropbox if you are a Product Manager or want to become one in the near future. The attrition rate in PM org is huge and lack of mentorship is appalling. Lots of unhappy PMs.","Fix management issues, if you want you attract long-term experienced employees.

2016-12-20, Marketing,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,A slowly sinking ship,More than 3 years,0,"Like many companies, Dropbox has amazing perks -- excellent food, really nice onsite gym, and there's no commute as it's located in SF. Most people at the company are nice, smart, humble, and hardworking, but the hiring bar has been lowered quite a bit over the last year. This is a great place to start your career if you're entry-level.","All that glitters isn't gold. Despite the glitz of the perks, many people at Dropbox are really unhappy. This is due to several things:
- Bad managers. Like, really bad. Very little training offered to new managers, and the company does not take action on managers who are consistently rated poorly or who have a lot of turnover on their team.
- Very little career development. If you're mid-to-senior level and you're looking for autonomy and responsibility, this is likely not the place for you.
- Dropbox is NOT a meritocracy. Many leveling and compensation decisions are based on favorites and are inconsistent from team to team, or level to level.
- Despite being a relatively small company, it's tough to get things done. Weighed down by red tape and bureaucracy. If you're someone who is execution-oriented and likes to move fast, look elsewhere.","Stick to the values and raise the hiring bar. Stop hiring and promoting bad managers. Train new managers, and get rid of the ones who aren't effective. Provide greater development and mentorship opportunities for people who want them. Hire a more seasoned and effective HR team. Be fair and consistent with compensation and leveling decisions.",2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0

Very collaborative culture - people are always willing to help solve problems or answer questions.
Amazing office space and fantastic perks.","Growing pains as the company grows from a small, agile startup to something bigger that needs more process.
Leadership can be hit or miss - some projects Dropbox executes on amazingly well but others feel like vanity projects for leadership that won't go anywhere.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
2017-01-06,,,Current Employee ,Inexperienced management,More than a year,0,"The benefits are great, but they are dwindling as the company looks at saving money. Nevertheless, they are far better than most companies in the area.","The majority of the management have very little experience (due to their age) so the management makes many immature mistakes. The company also things very highly of itself as a global leader that employs only the best in the field, but that's not actually something that's substantiated outside of the company itself. Advancement is nebulous and relies a lot on subjective traits and who your friends are.","Value experience that employees bring from outside of your company walls. Start leveling down the management that are in high levels simply because they have been at Dropbox for years, and start replacing them with experience managers with more industry experience.",2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,1.0

The benefits also speak to this.,"The only thing i can see so far is there is no downtown parking, however given an allowance a month helps with this. Plus in my opinion the amount of Pro's outweigh this.",Keep up the amazing work. As a new hire I have never felt more welcomed and appreciated at any other company that I have ever worked for.
