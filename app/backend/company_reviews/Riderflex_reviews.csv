I have worked with top executive search firms in the past and I have never experienced such a thorough engagement process. The team is thorough from the opportunity overview to the full supporting documentation.

You will be provided details about the position in a way that helps you envision whether or not it’s a true fit, plus you’ll have at your fingertips an understanding of every aspect of the people, the organization, and the product. You typically don’t gather this level of detailed information they provide until you’ve actually been in the position for weeks.

More importantly, I enjoyed each and every interaction with Steve and his team. I am a firm believer that your partners mirror you and your organization's ""persona"" and approach to doing business.

There's that gray area where you find out who's really listening and the relationship either evolves or dies in that final goodbye. I say all of that to make a point about great recruiting and the few that understand and takes the time to ""get you"" and what you do. It means everything to someone with experience to allow an agency to represent your abilities as a professional and they get it. They get you. If that doesn't ring bells in the realm of recruiter relationships, then you've haven't paid attention.",I can only speak on the process of vetting so absolutely no concerns at this point.,Keep growing and hire more talent gurus that take time with there candidates just like Steve.,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,,
