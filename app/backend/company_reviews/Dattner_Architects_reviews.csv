-Certain PMs in the Housing Studio don't do much work in terms of architecture, client, or team management. Zero CA knowledge. Would never be able to find a job if they were to leave Dattner. Spends most of their time monitoring their colleagues to see who he/she can rat on in hopes of promoting his/her own self worth.
-Management in the Interiors studio is usually seen making personal calls or chatting about his/her personal life, and can be heard throughout the studio. I've never personally seen him/her perform work-related tasks. Not sure what value they serve to the firm.
-Principals need to identify and appreciate those who work hard and care about doing a good job, and recognize those who just talk and don't actually perform.",Do a management level purge.

There are office quarterly mtgs to keep people updated about work within the firm and is a good time to know what other studios are working on. Also, CA happy hours and Revit Rants after 5pm are great for employees looking to get some more technical exp.","Not enough people with PM / PA experience. Too much office politics among upper management, they do not communicate effectively, and the stress is put onto employees. Difficult to get direction on projects and any attention at all from Partner in charge. Agree with last commenter that at all age/experience we need support. Partner should stick to a scheduled meeting with employees on project team, and if it changes, let your employee know, and not show up at their desk after 6:30pm.","There are many employees that care about their work and take it seriously.

Firm has a good relationship with the city, therefor there is some decent civic work firm is focused on. Firm is based on 3 studios: housing, transportation and healthcare/education.","My first 2 months I have seen 7 people leave overhearing how unsatisfied it is to work in the firm. I didn't quite understand what it is about myself, until a while has passed. Having 9 principals might be okay somewhere, but when they don't get along, work flow and organization is not firm's biggest asset anymore. Not a great place for interns. Firm does not pay for ARE, they only give you $1000 bonus when you become licensed. Their mentee-mentorship program does not exist so basically you are on your own. If you think someone cares if you have are learning enough/having enough to do that day, trust me they don't. When you tell principal what you would like to work on-noting really happens. They only care about themselves. If you are looking for a fun and healthy environment-this is not a place for you. Most of the employees are here only because of decent salary and because they have their families to feed,no one really wants to get personal or to get to know you better. God forbid you take a vacation, they will say OFC,except when you come back they will indirectly show you how angry they are that you are behind on your sumbittal. Overall, it's a pity because civic architecture is meaningful and there is some folks who can do something in the firm, except NO ONE CARES. Recently we got a new pincipal, ""managing partner"". Everything is great except she makes interns set up tables for monthly partner's meets while not putting her marketing team to do so. Interns/juniors might be starters, but they are not servers.

Good pay. Good place for young interns. Great depending on the studio or project. Had great experience working on city school project.,"The office has grown too fast. Too many individuals at the intermediate/advance level makes it hard for individuals with years of experience to learn, grow, get the appropriate mentoring and direction (at all age/experience we need support), and not feel frustrated. Hence there is a glass ceiling. This is particularly true with the studio and project I was working on.

I worked with an ambitious young inexperienced project manager, with same level of experience, who had limited PM experience, often times overwhelmed, unable to effectively manage without being emotionally bogged down and needed constant consoling. Aspects of a project managers that makes it difficult to properly do work.

The company needs to hire senior project managers with experience that have a proven track record.

Also, the company has been a revolving door with lots of people coming and going. The company is very political and though it tries at heart, they need to provide accessible and iIMPARTIAL channel for individuals to address grievances.","Get more people with extensive PM / PA experience.
