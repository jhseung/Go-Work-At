It has nice perks (fun lunches, happy hours, game room). When I started it was unlimited PTO but as a company grows, they have to have some regulation on that but I still am allotted a healthy amount of days off. (This is something misconstrued in a lot of reviews, it’s not only CSO that doesn’t have unlimited PTO, the only whole department that has unlimited is tech) Every year I’ve worked here, I’ve never actually used all of my PTO days anyway. I work for a team that shows they care about me whether it’s my work or personal life. Working for Snapsheet allowed me to move from a black hole of a town to Chicago and I really appreciate that.",Lack of realization that certain teams need more people.,"Not for my team in particular, but rather the customer service realm, just listen to your employees.

2019-04-20, Customer Success Specialist,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Snapsheet: A rollercoaster of emotions,Snapsheet: A rollercoaster of emotions,0,"Beautiful office, great location, happy hours, free lunches. There are nice people you can meet working there. The CEO is nice and very approachable. Management may give you the shifts you want but you to wait and be persistent.","When you start working at Snapsheet you are forced to work their horrible 10am-7pm shift. You are not given a choice when hired, if you want a job at Snapsheet you are reduced to working these grueling hours for over six months until they decide they can offer you a shift change. Six months isn't even a hard time frame of working the late shift, some employees are waiting up to a year for a shift change to be offered. At that point, employees have to request a shift change, but their managers will not respond right away with an answer.

The 10am-7pm shift made me feel awful and it messed with my lifestyle. When I wanted to work the earlier shift, it took management a month to tell me I couldn't because of the CSO team I was on. This took a toll on my mental health, I felt like Snapsheet did not care about the well-being of their employees. It was very insulting. I started to see it with how they treated everyone in CSO, not just me. It's upsetting that this company asks you to adapt to their ever-changing processes and business needs but they will not adapt to their own employees' needs.

Managers in CSO are all different. They do not seem to adhere to the same expectations, disciplinary actions, or management style. Basically, you have cool managers and strict managers.

Promotions seem to go to management favorites. You will see hard workers get passed up for promotions but instead see the person that doesn't know how to do anything get promoted because they know how to grovel to management. It's very sad and disappointing.

Snapsheet treats their CSO department, for lack of a better word, like ""bottom feeders."" We are not given unlimited PTO like the other departments. We have to log in when we use the bathroom, which is so demeaning and invasive. If we do request time off, it's such a racket with managers and department heads. They do not make it easy, which is very frustrating.

QA brings down morale and does not align with good accolades you get from your managers. QA is not consistent with their audits and they are very subjective with their feedback. They do not like getting feedback themselves about how they run their department.

The work is easy, outbound/inbound calls, sometimes customers and shops are rude but you get through it. It is still a customer service job. Once you get used to types of calls you are assigned to do, they change your workflow out of nowhere. QA would then will give you a bad audit that first week of your new workflow, there is no grace period to get used to your new assigned work. It was unfair and upsetting to see QA tear apart your calls.

They had a Saturday shift rotation which was infuriating. I don't care if get a random lieu day off during the week, I don't want to be downtown on a Saturday. I want two consecutive days off in row to mentally decompress from the grueling days of Snapsheet.

ALSO, they don't give you desk drawers. you have you things just under your desk with privacy or protection.","This company needs to promote and appreciate the hard workers in CSO, because they are in no position to lose any more of them.
Please listen to your employees and don't make them feel like just another number. We are hard working people, with degrees and education, do not make us feel less than.

I think less beer and more help for commuters should be implemented. The company is composed of mostly young people so there is pressure to drink and be part of the after work party culture. Top performers do not get rewarded, they get a “great job” but that means nothing; my hard work should be respected. Promotions are for the ones who do make friends with everyone, the ones who do stay every Friday to drink. Inbounders should be better taken care of. They handle the tough calls yet outbounders get the most rewards for leaving voicemails.

The office is incredible - we have unlimited snacks, a cereal bar, coffee and beverages, a game room, a NAP room, and a super fun happy hour every Friday at 4:30. To top it off we have great out of office events - our holiday party and summer picnic are an absolute blast!

Like any call center - the job can be redundant but we have such a comfortable space, very limited micro-management and there is a ton of room for promotion if you work hard and commit to the company. The call per hour expectation is not crazy either! The pay is great and the job is INCREDIBLY easy - plus we have AWESOME benefits.

No more unlimited PTO, no more unpaid time...getting sick has to be scheduled, apparently. No more salaried paychecks. Everything that used to make this place feel like a good choice have been stripped away by greed under a facade of ""diversity"" and customer care.","I've never worked for a company with time bathroom breaks. Employees who actually do good work are never considered for promotions. Those are for people who schmooze with managers over beer. Warnings last for six months. That's right. 6. For half a year, you get your nose rubbed into whatever minor infraction you committed, usually regarding QA scores which unfairly target inbounders, even though there's less of us than there are outbounders. Nothing makes sense and nothing is fair. Inbounders do the most work and get least amount of praise for it.

The level of favoritism is astounding and infuriating all at once. Second interviews are given to people who don't even want to go further, yet deserving candidates are told they did well but the position is going to a mediocre employee. Also, we work holidays where most people are not even in the building. MLK day we work. The day after Christmas we work. When there are subzero temperatures in Chicago, we're still encouraged to come in. An email sent out to us regarding the brutal weather even pretty much said they value customers and carriers more than their hard-working CSS employees, who, if all left the office for just a few hours and left them to handle calls, would probably break down and cry in a fit of frustration and confusion.

The trainer isn't actually a trainer, she's just there to kill trees and read off of Powerpoint slides. In these trainings, we're treated like children instead of grown adults.

Spanish speakers are treated the absolute worst and I would advise anyone who speaks Spanish who still wants to work here after reading this to not mention it to them. You won't even be able to go for other positions because they have so few speakers as it is.

The only ""diversity"" in this company can be found in CSS, or the ""bottom-feeders"" as someone in upper management once referred to us. That's your thanks for working here.

QA is ridiculous and anxiety-inducing, and even if they made a mistake, if you appeal it, someone else who was also unfairly appointed to her role can deny it and leave you with a low call score. There is no reason why I literally feel sick to my stomach when approaching another QA score. These scores essentially dictate whether or not you will have a job with Snapsheet in the near future. God forbid you forget one little thing, in which you basically fail the call, and then your manager will have to give you a stern talking to about ""consistency."" There are just so many awful things you have to face every day, but we're made to feel like we're important even though we know the truth. No other department has timed pee breaks. No other department has to deal with QA scores. I almost feel like upper management is punishing us for working here. Why on earth would they want to treat us like robots without bladders, I'm not sure. But it definitely has pushed me into looking for new jobs.

Make your stats and your QA scores are good? Awesome...we won’t hassle you. Use the bathroom for two minutes then take your fifteen minute break? You’ve now gone two minutes over your break time. Disciplinary action can and does occur.

Yes you heard me right. Using a bathroom counts as break time. Pee twice (and walk across the office and wait for three urinals for a 200+ person office) and that takes ten minutes total? Enjoy your 5 minute break.

Enjoy managers making statements such as “why should the company suffer for your bathroom habits”?

Amazon Connect tracking knows your location down to a tee. Go into break status to walk to the kitchen and refill your water? That’s a break! Hope you enjoyed it. Ignore the fact you talk on phones all day long and water is the only thing keeping your throat from drying up completely.

This job infantilizes you to a pure metric they cannot be trusted. You can be a mature adult, with a college degree, and risk write ups based on using a restroom.

Snapsheet loves using “the stick” as your primary motivator. Do this? Write ups and terminations. Do that? Write ups and terminations. They change the rules day of then look for people to violate them.

They claim we are a “family...and that is true...if your parents were insanely strict and sought out the most minor of “infractions” to ground you for!

- There remains a handful of intelligent people who work hard","This review is strictly in regard to the negative experiences of working in the CSO. Outside of this department people seem to be fairly happy and content.
The CSO work space was designed to be physically divided from the rest of the office, which adds to management's intentional plan to isolate and alienate the CSO employees from the rest of the office. To say that management treats you as a second class citizen would be giving them too much credit, it assumes they treat you like anything at all.

I could go on describing the myriad ways in which the company makes you feel small, hopeless, worthless, and constantly Othered but I will instead list some facts about the policies and politics that dictate the work place environment.

- All you do is call and receive calls for 8 hours a day, everyday, no matter what. That obviously is not fun or dignified, the company also doesn't make any attempt to make it easier for you or your team.
- The company will lure you in saying they love to promote from within (you could even be manager!) and that they maintain a fun environment, this hasn't been true for about two years. It is dismal and petty.
- While nesting is 2+ weeks long, you will be trained by one of the most inept and condescending people in the entire company and spend hours a day cringing as they talk down to you for the duration of your tenure in the CSO.
- You will also be taught how to correctly mislead, withhold information, and generally make yourself the human shield protecting the million dollar insurance giants you'll represent. Enjoy your hourly wage.
- C-Level and VP executives rarely ever work a standard 8 hour day, or even a 5 day work week, yet they are all salaried and behave with complete immunity to the rules and regulations imposed on the CSO.
- If you are more than 5 minutes late, for any reason, you are punished
- If you want to leave your desk, you must log that time in your computer system. Your managers will all know when you get a drink, have a snack, take a walk, and even use the toilet. CSO is the only department in the company that makes you log every second of your time or risk punishment.
- Your managers will all have unlimited PTO and sick days, also, so does everyone else in the entire company except for CSO. Enjoy being coughed on at your desk. Enjoy coming in to work when there are huge blizzards and it's about to break record low temperatures in Chicago.
- When I requested a reasonable 5% annual raise, I was told the company couldn't afford that at the time. The next month they hired four new VPs with newly created job titles.
- Someone at the company writes fake 5-star reviews of the company on this site. It is easy to see which reviews are clearly written by the same person and used to boost the overall score of the company on this site. Pathetic.
- The COO once yelled profanity at a subordinate several levels beneath them in a crowded public work space. That is the level of care and professionalism that is bleeding down from the top.

The company repeatedly exhibits patterns of disrespect and hostility to its employees in the CSO, both nuanced and vulgar. The CSO is the whipping mule of the entire company. They need you to be present at all times of the day and night because the CSO is one of the primary sources of income for the company, CSO is a crucial selling point to new business partners, yet we are paid crumbs and treated like dirt. They justify all of this behavior by saying it's standard and common in the tech industry, then pat themselves on the back for being an ""industry disrupter."" This willful and glaring hypocrisy pervades the entire company, and sours every facet of working here.","Cut the micromanaging forever. Provide employees in the CSO with equal opportunities for advancement as well as the same benefits and perks available to everyone else at the company, we need a better work/life balance.

Blatant disregard for what’s really happening
Genuine lack of care for employee well being and happiness","I’ve been with the company for a little over a year now and it has been a smoke and mirrors show from the beginning. The company is aware of how many adjusters are feeling working for bigger, corporate companies so they use that to make Snapsheet seem like they’re different. The truth of the matter is Snapsheet manages to create one of the worst possible work environments without even being in the same room.

The majority of management that I have come across, with the exception of a select few, have made it clear that they have no idea how to properly and effectively manage and motivate people. They speak to us in deragatory tone and are constantly contradicting themselves day in and day out. When concerns or issues with how things are get brought to light, it is seen as an excuse or we aren’t thinking about it the right way.

The work environment they create is that of a sweatshop for claims. No matter how hard we work it’s never enough and they rule with an iron fist. Problems are identified or goals are set but management offers no solutions on how to meet those goals. They just simply want it done, o excuses.

When extra time is needed to meet agreements with carriers, management has gone as far as calling us individually and asking what our plans are and why we haven’t volunteered our extra time to work more. They’ve asked us to speak with our families in anticipation of heavier work load to identify and determine how much extra we can work. There is a blatant disregard for the work/life balance and they simply do not care about employee happiness or morale.

My advice to management is open your eyes and clean house. Most managers have been promoted based on seniority and not by skill and qualification. This company could be something great, instead it will be a revolving door for people to make decent money in the short term.

2018-10-14, Dedicated Employee That Had Enough,"Chicago, IL",Former Employee ,Customer Success Specialist,Customer Success Specialist,0,Convenient location and free snacks,"This was the most unorganized and unprofessional company I have experienced. Promotions are given based off of favoritism and managers lack experience, preferring to make themselves look good, rather than helping their employees succeed and grow. Managers often come across as unprofessional, where gossiping and the sharing of employees’ confidential matters has been an issue in the past. What started as a promising start-up company has experienced growing pains, as they continue to grow quicker than they can handle. This has led to the hiring of many employees that do not have the experience for this role, due to the need of people to fill seats in this call center atmosphere. The turnover rate is alarmingly high, with both upper management and new hires quitting at a rapid rate.

Micromanagement causes employees to experience high amounts of unnecessary stress and pressure, as employees are asked to track every time they leave their desk. This includes tracking time spent in the bathroom, as well as getting “points” for coming to work late by a few minutes. While the office is in a great location, they have spent too much money focusing on making the office appear flashy, rather than maintaining employee benefits, as they have gotten rid of unlimited pto, and have made it nearly impossible for hardworking employees to get raises or move up in the company.","To increase productivity, the company needs to hire and promote candidates that actually have the characteristics and experience suited for the role, not just hire based off of favoritism. Managers are often unprofessional as they are too focused on themselves, and upper management turns a blind eye on major problems to focus on turning out high numbers.

Everyone on the tech team codes to some degree all the way up to the VP of engineering... even the CTO gets his hands dirty sometimes.
We try to use the latest and hottest technologies and keep the framework versions to the bleeding edge. I found this very hard to do in companies that have tight dependencies with legacy systems.

+ Continuous deployment
For most services, deployment to production is done several times a day.

+ Learning opportunities
Snapsheet has sponsored every conference I've wanted to attend and they pay for online courses.
Additionally, every other Thursday we have the opportunity to present our work and research to the entire engineering team. This gives us the chance to grow as a public speaker, or learn from peers.

+ Hackdays
Every other Friday we have Hackdays where we can work on whatever we want. The only condition is that our project has to positively impact at least one other person at the company.
You're not supposed to do any kind of work related tasks during hackdays. I think the company does a pretty good job at enforcing this. After all, hackdays seem to be in the DNA of the Snapsheet culture.
Things that I've seen come out of hackdays include: open source PyPi and NPM packages, Ruby Gems, Sublime and Atom plugins, Chrome plugins, internal services that streamline the development process, a frontend kit, several machine learning applications using NLP, image recognition, etc.

+ Open Source
Writing open source software and reusable packages is extremely encouraged. This gives each of us a chance to showcase our work to the world while actively building Snapsheet's credibility in the software community. While some companies might shy away from open source, I like that Snapsheet realizes this win-win opportunity.

+ Perks
We have happy hours every Friday - a bartender pours beers and wine until 9pm. We have team outings at least once a month like Built in Brews events.
Our team frequently uses the game room equipped with ping pong, foosball, PlayStation, Nintendo switch, pop-a-shot, bubble hockey. Don't expect to be able to win a ping pong game for at least a few months.

+ Low Turnover
In my 3 years at Snapsheet, I have seen less than 5 people from the engineering team leave the company.","- In many instances, the technology used by insurance companies is very outdated, and sometimes we need to integrate with these systems that are poorly supported.
On the flip side, I think this is the very reason why Snapsheet is so successful. It is the first company to identify this gap in the industry and do something about it.

Working from home if applicable (even better if a family oriented person).

Compensation (based on many factors, all of which are measured and expected).

Benefits (amazing, even with the normal expectations of costs, even better for families).

Team Spirit & Family (although distinctly separated by departments, the feeling of family is always present).

Being given a chance to shine, not only that, but the resources and backing to help one flourish and grow in order to succeed, anyone who says otherwise is a person who fights a well tuned system and is looking for handouts and daily recognition. This is not how the world works children. You work, you earn, you reap the benefits of an honest days work knowing you did your all, gave your all and earned your keep.

Licensing is Huge, where are you going to find a company that covers it all in order for a mutual win/win situation. More licenses, more states to write in, more valuable of an employee, seems pretty clear to me.

That said, handfuls of individuals have forced these changes (past or present), one or two bad apples right? Wrong.

*LISTEN to your employees - In order for change you have to be able to see things for what they could be not just for what they are. People do care and they do want things to work and work well, but NO ONE LISTENS TO UNDERSTAND THEY LISTEN TO REPLY.
*Fix your problems before they or you get too big to fix.
*Fire all you upper managers (they manipulate the numbers in their favor without any regard to the people that help to keep them in those seats, plus over promising to your carriers about how many can be done is a huge disservice to your company and when your carriers realize the quality isn't there and you've under delivered they will find someone else.
*Learn the difference in your estimating systems and the fact that not all estimates can be done in 15 minutes, some require carrier and dealer calls, some are one line and some are 100 they should not all be graded the same.
*Train your CSO's to input all the information needed or obtain it prior to sending it off to the estimator, you pay us good money for our knowledge and to write accurate estimates you should not be wasting that money on us doing clerical that should have already been done before the file was sent out.
*Communicate with your carriers about constant issues and missing info (I'm sure if they knew they weren't doing it correctly they would change it knowing that it would drastically reduce the number of calls they receive per day).
*Be consistent train the way you expect it to be done when we get home (lots of corners are cut to hit the current 20 per day and quality is sacrificed over quantity, of course the numbers won't show that but with and unbiased audit I'm sure you'll see)
*Train better - in training we did about 5 estimates in 2 weeks and then sent home and told if we have questions reach out, Almost all of the training was powerpoint and no hands on.
*Give your developmental team and managers the time to actually develop and train because if you just throw your employees there and not try to figure out why they aren't hitting your ridiculous metrics then NOTHING will change because they are doing the same thing on the developmental team as they were on the production team
*Quit wasting your money - Have you not seen the trend? Is no one looking at the number of people you hire and only 1 or 2 make if out of a group? If your going to waste all that money for a 2 week vacation in Chicago and licenses, you already throw your new employees to the wolves without proper training why not just poorly train them at home?

There are great managers and there are no so great managers. Just like everywhere else. The great ones inevitably seem get eaten up, beaten down or ashamed of what they have to do and end up making the choice to jump ship or tow the corporate line.

Then again the company is in this awkward teenager phase between all of the cocaine themed out frat parties and a huge shift to corporate clean up. (Yes, they enforced the zero tolerance you read about in other reviews) It’s rocky. People are unhappy and afraid, not everyone knew some of the horrible things that went on, luckily. The investment into your career is major. Working for a swank down town “start up” (guys cmon we are so not a startup anymore) or working from home is a huge draw and what keeps people hoping that this better way will still come. Who knows maybe it will. The new regime is a complete 180.

For me, some days I’m just tired of being lied to, given false promises and lead on. Other days I would shout from the rooftops my love of all things Snapsheet.

Additionally, the standards for management are still in the works of being normalized. I’ve seen a lot of different people in different leadership roles that were asked to leave, step down, or transfer.

Everyone seems to get along and be open to collaboration.

- They try to keep company morale up with events such as monthly fun lunches and the usual holiday parties and a summer picnic. They also allow happy hours after work so we can have a few drinks and socialize. They also do a monthly newsletter.

- Management is open to speaking to employees who want to take the initiative to improve on processes and have ideas for making sure we provide a great user experience and excellent customer service","Since it's a startup, it's a work in progress. There's a lot of trial and error going on with the processes being done in Customer Service, so sometimes things change on the turn of a dime and it can be overwhelming if you aren't able to handle frequent updates to processes and don't take notes.

-Change is slow moving. While they have an open door policy to ideas to improve processes, sometimes those ideas dont come to fruition for weeks or months, if at all.

-It can be hard to know who to go to if you have an idea and who needs to be hearing/documenting these items so they can be piloted or implemented to help the company. Chain of command/department contacts isn't too clearly defined.

- Communication within the department could be better. Sometimes changes are announced in a group chat, which is also filled with common conversation. Updates are not easy to spot in the chat and it would be better if the department was emailed once or twice a day (if needed) to update the team, not in a chat where you can easily miss the information if you are busy on the phone or out of the office on PTO/sick day.

- A little concern with how promotions are given. It seems some people have received leadership roles but are making mistakes that someone new to the company would make on a file. Doesn't set a good example for the people they are managing and leaves concerns that these people will start making those same errors, creating more errors and causing files to be triaged and delays in servicing customers.

The potential for growth and development is limitless with the way the company is changing over the next year or so. If you work hard, and show your commitment to the company values, it absolutely pays off.

Snapsheet constantly promotes internally, and gives plenty of opportunity for lateral development as well. Almost everyone in management has been promoted from within and has done the grunt work to get to where they are. It's great to know that your manager gets where you're coming from and that they understand the work you do.

The company culture is also really great. They provide free lunches for the entire company at least once a month. There is a great kitchen set up in-office with free cereal, soda, and four kegs (for after hours only). They work hard to provide an environment where people will enjoy themselves when they are here.

All in all, it's a great place to work with a ton of growth potential. You must be able to work hard and prove yourself, and entitlement will get you nowhere, but what you bring to the table is exactly what you'll get out of working here.","Not necessarily a con, but Snapsheet is definitely a lean machine.

No representation for the employee. So if you don't like working the extra hours and not getting paid all the time you need to go to dept of labor. There isn't anyone there that you can voice concerns to. The alleged HR person is a recruiter and married to the CEO. Unethical. Do your homework before you leave a good job and come here. You need to be prepared to work at a pace that is not human. And if you think working remote from home is a reward, it's not. That is their justification for making you do more.

Working at snapsheet you are required to do more then twice that many. The lofty goals of hitting 20-23 estimates everyday, no mater how large the claims are. There is on advrage 6-8 people a day that can hit the 23 claims in a day. They hand out the claims and you are graded and timed on everything. That’s right you are a number and they are pulling all the data on you when it come to advancement and if you do not mean there expectations you get written up. Then keep in mind they hand out the claims and if it’s a slow day and they don’t have claims, well time counts against you. You better make up the claims and time somewhere.

Keep in mind if all the info was not given by the customer or not in the photos, you better act quick and start looking. No mater how big the damage is, If you go over 10 min then you better hope you get a easy claim to make up the time. In doing this you can see why other are saying the estimates are crap.
