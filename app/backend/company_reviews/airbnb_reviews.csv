2019-03-13, Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Great perks, pay, and people",More than a year,0,"Most people are extremely nice and driven at Airbnb.

You can really find whatever you are looking for in a team.

The tech stack is a priority for the company, which makes the company a great place to work as an engineer. We have tech talks at the office, open source projects, stipends to attend conferences, etc. We encourage novel/optimal technical solutions even when the project may take more time, and we (at least recently) are trying to build with the long term in mind.","Office politics can be frustrating
Designers have too much power and many don't know how to build UX or be on top of projects
The quality of engineers is highly variable","1. Let go of more engineers who aren't meeting expectations - they are difficult to work with and continuing to play nice is a lose-lose situation for both parties involved. It hurts our brand, wastes money, and lowers the quality of our product. I think we also need to revisit our interview process to make it more fair and filter out more low quality engineers.
2. Being kind (""Be a host"", etc.) does not need to translate into padding every piece of feedback with niceties. I would prefer if the office culture tended more towards radical candor and less towards ""fake nice""",5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

Good food program.
Nice offices.","Middle management is largely promoted from ops with little to no training.
Poorly equipped and regular blockers.
Poor organization management.
Lots of blocks for growth.
Regular reorganization that accomplishes little and the lower level employees have to deal with ever changing landscape.
Headquarters engineers make a lot of money but operational people are often paid under market rates.
No pay transparency and poor management creates confusion.","Stop reorganizing.

2018-11-18,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Working here over a year...,More than a year,0,"- Compensation: pays more than any other tech company (Google, FB, etc) PLUS new cash bonus PLUS can choose to take your equity refreshers (no cliff) in cash. They also bump everyone to above midpoint of the range, which is really kind and close any gaps for pay equity.

- Business is doing really well: we're profitable, have money to invest in employees + new ventures, never worried about money. Not even having a round of funding for this far out is amazing.

- Great benefits. Free airbnb credits (never expire), lots of PTO and time off, easy parking lot next to the building (they reimburse the price), free lyft credits, top notch food program, etc.

- Management is honest about their pitfalls and is honest about fixing it. I appreciate this because they could sweep it under the rug.

- We're heavily invested in our infrastructure as a 2019 focus. Even hired a CTO who has decades of infrastructure heavy lifting under his belt. Sweet!

- People are really kind and helpful. Fairly rare. There are always going to be politics because people befriend eachother, but honestly you can set up a meeting with a director and they will help you resolve easily. As long as you speak out, people will listen.","Typical growing pains for our size, honestly. For a long time, Airbnb was flat and you could grow your career quickly since the company was small. Now they're trying to add ways to grow your career and make it defined and achievable since there's not low hanging fruit from a flat org, which is good. There's also increased attrition for people who have been here 5-7+ years, but honestly I think fresh people who are excited and new have been better for my team personally. Many managers are also junior, but we've started to hire senior managers - my manager's manager has been doing a great job shaping and changing, which I appreciate.","Get more senior managers rather than junior, it's been helping out. Check their participation rates and hapiness of their reports before hiring them though. Be more stringent on 1st time managers because it's dangerous.

-You will work with some of the nicest people in the industry who are truly exceptional
-Great benefits including free lunch and snacks, quarterly travel coupons
-The CEO truly cares about what the company is doing and it's mission; he holds regular Q+As with employees and makes a visible effort to connect.","-Pay is not that great, I started out at $18/hour and after 3 years at the company, I was only making $20.65 after being promoted
- Little room for growth in role and lack of transparency with how employees receive raises. My lead could not or would not provide me with a direct answer or explanation as to why I was making significantly less than other employees at same SL.
- Metrics can be unreasonable at times due to the nature of the work. You are expected to close X cases a day and maintain a certain NPS, along with other metrics, although you are usually handling mishandled, escalated cases from external support teams that can take days to close. You never know what kind of call/ticket you will get, if it will be a case that takes days to resolve, or if it will be a simple account questions. You are also expected to answer questions with little resources for you and silo-ed departments, with the company motto being 'build the plane as it takes off'.
-Along with having to be compliant with 'call controls' just trying to stay afloat making your 14 cases, you will get pinged throughout the day asking if you can take over other mis-escalated cases. Even if you are overwhelmed with casework and know you don't have the bandwith to take these on, you will quickly lose favor with upper management if you don't.
-Casework can be very stressful, and while the company does it's best with trying to offset this with a fantastic food program and seminars, it emotionally drains you. CX work is more of a mediation role.
-Within the 3 years that I was there, it increasingly became more like a call center, with more micromanaging of your time within the call controls, breaks, etc. Ultimately, this work environment along with poor compensation and lack of upward mobility left me no choice but to accept another offer at a different company, which was one of the hardest and most bittersweet decisions that I ever have made career wise.","Be more transparent with pay structures, realize that the nature of the casework is ambiguous and micromanage less.

2018-08-06,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Explosive growth with an excellent culture and mission!,More than a year,0,"Summary: I'm really happy here and it's the best job I've ever had. That said, details:

1. People: The people here are really smart, really nice, and really accommodating of healthy work/life balance which is CRAZY important for longevity and long-term happiness. The people are a pleasure to work with, they're helpful, knowledgeable, and REALLY passionate about the company. I have an amazing Manager who advocates for me and it's been such a great experience.

2. Projects: The projects here are those you can't find elsewhere simply because Airbnb is a one-of-a-kind company. A lot of the operational problems we're building and fixing haven't been navigated before. You have a chance to create new processes, projects, and impact in this industry.

3. Culture: This place is serious about its culture or ""Core Values"": do the right thing, advance the mission, don't backstab, don't throw people under the bus, and stand up for the underdog. To give you an idea of the kind of people we want: one of our people raised $20 million for immigrant kids separated from their parents on Facebook-- the largest fundraiser in Facebook's history.

4. Benefits + Compensation: They'll comp you properly, trust me. Airbnb gives a generous total compensation package with lots of stock, fully covered health care/dental/vision for you, $500 in Airbnb credits per quarter, free food (breakfast/lunch/dinner), and all the cool Silicon Valley perks.

5. Flexibility: Work from home, work remotely, take PTO-- just make sure your projects get done. A+++ on this.","1. Disorganization: Hyper growth mode has created some disorganization and issues with accountability. It can be difficult to get things done with random PTOs and a softer culture when it comes to communication.

2. Career advancement: Upward mobility/ career advancement expectations can be slow or unclear because of the disorganization. You have to advocate for yourself and develop a great relationship with your manager.

3. Liquidity: Airbnb isn't a public company so those looking to sell their stocks need to wait for a liquidity event or for the company to IPO. As much as stocks are great, they can't pay the bills so giving employees more opportunity to cash out is important for those of us who aren't billionaires. FYI leadership listened to this complaint and they recently gave us a new way to cash out some of our stock + comp which is a great start.","1. Create and communicate clear paths for career growth and advancement. This is the best way to retain your highest performers who are hungry for more responsibility and impact.

2. Preserve the culture here. It's an amazing and unique strength of the company. You became successful with the current culture; protect it whether or not you decide to go public.",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

Overall nice people.,"Rather political environment - it seems to me that making ""friends"" and pleasing your manager is more important than doing solid work. Fake and hypocritical. I feel they don't practice what they preach.

Another complaint I have is on the engineering side. There are many talented engineers hired from top schools and FB/GOOG/AMZN/LNKD/MSFT, but miraculously the quality of Airbnb's engineering is not that good, as you can tell from how slow the website and the app are even today. Again, this probably is related to the culture of the company.","Get rid of those senior managers who only care about their own ""career"" and how to make their managers happy.

Lots of opportunities for DS mentorship from experienced folks if you seek it out. $1000 Education stipend.
- Competitive compensation for DS and other positions. Company is profitable and usually generous to its employees.
- All the usual great perks of a Sillicon Valley company like food, great snacks, flexible working hours, lots of benefits etc + $2000 in Airbnb credits/year
- Great tooling and always improving on this (Knowledge Repo, data portal, R, Python servers, modeling platform etc)
- Decent company growth and diversification
- Not everything is perfect, but DS leadership listens, is open to feedback and acts on the feedback
- Great company and DS brand
- Strong data culture: data has a strong voice and DS are respected. People are eager to learn more about data through Data U. Focus on data self sufficiency etc.

- Inclusive, diverse and welcoming culture","- Waiting for IPO. Company took action to increase cash comp in the meantime (which was highly appreciated!), but still would be great to IPO soon
- Still lots of improvement for data tooling (Superset, pipelining etc) and data quality
- Often stretched thin, which can be stressful. Need to hire more DS faster
- Food is sometimes great, sometimes just ok
- Wish the office was closer to public transportation. Lyft credits mostly solve this, though.

2) The team has a wealth of expertise in many fields of data science, ML, forecasting, Analytics, etc. Whenever I have a question, there is always someone on the team who is an expert that I can learn from.
3) I really like our internal tools - both Airflow and Superset are two of my favorite new tools since joining Airbnb. Also our internal experimentation platform.
4) I'm excited to work for a company that I think is genuinely making the world a better place by helping people connect and belong. I came to the US as a refugee, and Airbnb's stand for refugees made me proud to work here.

- The pay is pretty paltry, no bonus structure, equity package is nothing to write home about.
- Decisions are frequently based on ""feelings"" rather than data, which can be infuriating. Data-driven decision making and overall rigor is not something that's naturally part of the culture. It varies team to team based on whether someone came from a company that was better at utilizing data in everyday work.
- Airbnb likes to do everything their own way even if there are existing solutions in the market. Not very smart if they think reinventing the wheel is always the right decision.
- The caliber of employees at Airbnb is not nearly as good as ones I've worked with at ""Big 4"" tech companies, but they sure think they are hot shots. A lot of arrogance fuels the company at every level. There's a lot of style over substance here.
- The SF office looks great out in the atrium, but the desk areas tend to be dark, cramped and loud. Not the best environment for concentrating and getting things done.
- Employees get their personal items stolen off their desks on a regular basis with little assistance from Security team.
- This is very much a hospitality company first and foremost, and a tech company second. Quite a culture shock if you're coming from a die hard tech company (consumer/enterprise software, AR, VR, robotics, gaming, etc). I've experienced this numerous times: mentioning something marginally technical and being faced with blank stares.
- The company is a hot mess internally. No standardization in software, minimal cross-team collaboration, no version history in the codebase (well there might be some but not for everything that gets committed), lots of politics and jockeying for position/visibility, teams are very protective rather than collaborative seemingly forgetting we all work at the same place for the same goals.","- Brian is not a leader who inspires confidence. None of the founders actually do. They don't hold a candle to the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry & Sergey, Elon Musk, etc.
- Disappointing LT left since he was getting us on track to growing up and doing things smartly.
- Focus on doing a few things really well, not a million things at below average. We're currently doing the latter.

The outside image and recruiting brand definitely looks much better than the reality inside. They recently cut the food team while taking about the brand of AIRFAM when recruiting - no family is disposable for financial reasons, if you cannot stand for your culture then do not say or brand it.

Broken operation - I have been working for several tech companies big and small, the management at Airbnb is definitely on the chaotic side. Teams step on each others’ toes, nonsense frequent reorganization, people get promoted by taking others’ credit. Mid management focus on growing their own career here rather than helping team or their reports be successful. Setting up your authority in the organization or being an early employee is more important than doing actual impactful work. Many managers promoted within the company from early days do not know how to manage and often meddle with employee’s work.

Lack of innovation - most of middle management here, as a result of trying to promote their own career, do not take bold innovative approach to the business. The result is a lack of innovation to make impact but rather fine tuning to make their performance review looks good or please their upper management.

No work life balance - you are expected to work A LOT sometimes 70-80 hours when you are on certain teams.","Fix your middle management, find out those who are setting up authority and prevent innovation. Stand up for what you are saying about the culture or not saying it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

2. So much Kool-Aid I mean its organic and locally sourced but you better be ready to drink from the fire-hose. If you can go full Stockholm syndrome you will enjoy the ""culture"".

3. Core-values are mostly phony-baloney and a way to sort out the cool kids from the rest. The company misses out on serious talent due to people being eliminated in core values interviews (google it).

4. Work-life balance does not exist yet. people are trying but dont be fooled you will suffer for trying to maintain balance in your life esp. if you have a family or priorities outside Airbnb.

5. Emphasis on drinking at company events and off-sites is not like anything ive ever seen. If you arent a drinker you will feel left-out at events.

-- Growing at fast pace

-- Beautiful office","-- Lots of people are here for the wrong reasons. Whether people want to admit it or not, countless people are here for the equity, and won't hesitate to jump ship when things go south. There are prank emails titled ""Important IPO Update"" to get people's attention; I've overheard countless conversations with people 1) reminiscing about their old company and not willing to leave until they vest, 2) not being truly passionate about the product, or 3) directly comparing how much equity they got. The IPO is a constant question that's asked during all-hands and is frequently the most upvoted.
-- The Kool-Aid here is stronger than ever. Buy into the cult or leave. A ton of people are hesitant or afraid to tell upper management about what they don't like about recent/upcoming product(s) such as Magical Trips. Several coworkers whom I've talked to and I have been part of conversations (even involving middle management) where people have openly voiced their concerns or complaints.
-- Really poor transparency. Political. Depends on your team and YMMV. Your manager may verbally tell you that you're doing great and dole out compliments every so often, but you may be shocked when your performance reviews come out.
-- ""Culture"" can be described as how well you embody the company's mission and core values, and is ridiculously subjective. Lots of talented people don't make the cut because they failed to make a good impression on the core values interviews. It's Airbnb's way of weeding out people who aren't a ""good fit"" for their clique.
-- Very cliquey, feels like a frat. If you fit in, you'll like it. If you don't, you won't. Emphasis on drinking at company events. Overheard multiple people on different occasions making straight up sexist remarks during and after work.
-- Poor work-life balance. People appear happy-go-lucky but many are in fact stressed out. Lyft drivers often tell me how people complain about work. Coworkers I've talked to complain about the constant pressure to do well for performance evaluations.
