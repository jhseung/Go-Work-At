2016-01-07,,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Living the dream,Living the dream,0,"+Meaningful, impressive company mission. People in different areas of the group are all excited to work toward a common goal. You feel like you're doing something worthwhile with your life by working here.
+Brilliant co-workers with diverse backgrounds. People here could certainly have healthy egos, but instead they are, for the most part, quite humble.
+Opportunities to learn are endless. Even casual hallway conversations are super interesting to listen in on.
+Fascinating talks given regularly by employees and outside speakers.
+Your ideas are listened to and valued, even if the company decides to go in a different direction.
+Management seems thoughtful, and actually cares about the well-being and happiness of employees.
+Great culture and very reasonable work/life balance.
+Awesome perks and benefits, new surprises all the time!
+Pay is really high; of course Manhattan and surrounding areas are very expensive, but the high pay here makes it a non-issue.","I don't have a lot of complaints personally. Some people might not like the lack of hand-holding that comes along with having a group of such driven, accomplished, capable people working at the company. Don't work here if you want to be micro-managed or blindly follow orders without question.",,5.0,,,,,
2018-03-18, Scientific Associate,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,Great place to do science so long as you don't believe in the mission,Great place to do science so long as you don't believe in the mission,0,"In the time I spent at DESRES, I had a chance to work with a truly brilliant set of scientists. Regardless of your background, you will learn a lot if you work here. I completely agree with another reviewer about the fascinating talks and opportunities to learn.","The managers are as stubborn as (some of the) scientists are brilliant. The merit of an idea is worth nothing compared to the standing of the person saying it, so the managers fail to take criticisms of some of the company's main research efforts seriously. This leads DESRES to waste resources on projects that seem unlikely to lead anywhere.

It is hard to believe that such a risk-averse strategy will accomplish its goal of revolutionizing drug discovery. Granted, the scientific output is impressive and important, but as the company pivots its focus toward drug discovery and away from basic science, its relevance dwindles.

Overall, I recommend working here as long as one is willing to work on a dead-end project in exchange for a large salary and a chance to learn some science on the side. Many would see this as a very fair trade-off, but I decided to take my chances elsewhere.","If what you want is to make money, just keep doing what you're doing as it seems to keep David happy. If you want to make a difference, perhaps think seriously about the chances that the status quo will revolutionize drug discovery.",3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

2014-11-02,,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Really inspiring team working on important problems,Really inspiring team working on important problems,0,"Even at a major university you won't find the level of intelligence and talent you'll find here, and certainly not at your average company. (Google, maybe.) Everyone's just really, really smart, you'll find experts in a wide range of fields (engineering, scientific and otherwise), and pretty much everyone I've met is helpful and willing to talk to you. No, there isn't much structure, but isn't that a good thing? You just have to take initiative to figure out what's needed and how you can contribute. I've seen people given pretty big new responsibilities just because they showed an interest and that they could handle it. Not saying it always works out, but how many places is something like that even a possibility? Plus, the project's an important one: designing new drugs and improving how drugs are designed. And they pay very well. I really don't get what other reviewers are grousing about. How many jobs give you great pay, super-smart co-workers, a good mission, and minimal Dilbert-like corporate BS to ruin your day?","No job is perfect, and if you want something to be unhappy about, you'll find something. Yes, some of the managers are probably better engineers or chemists than they are managers, so the management part of their job can get neglected. But I'd rather pay that price than work under a bunch of people who are professional middle-managers but lousy engineers or mediocre scientists or just not very intelligent.","It's an unusual environment, and judging by some of the reviews on here not everyone is prepared to get the most out of it. Maybe take more pains during the hiring process to explain what it's like, so people who aren't going to like it have a chance to opt out, rather than coming and being unhappy? Clearly, for the right people it works out great (it can't be an accident that there are so many people who've been here 5-10 years).",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Advance the state of the art in molecular dynamics to shorten the path to drug discovery.,"Many good engineers work here. Management is very poor, but their lack of competence is hidden by the productivity and self-organizing abilities of their engineers. David Shaw gets his results, but it's not through the capabilities of the management.","Institute 360 reviews so that managers can be reviewed by their peers and their reports. In a company where decisions are data driven and results are expected, the only people not subject to data and review are the managers.

2013-12-29,,"New York, NY",Former Employee ,"On Balance, an Unpleasant Experience (Your Mileage May Vary)","On Balance, an Unpleasant Experience (Your Mileage May Vary)",0,"A chance to work on a potentially world-changing scientific project. Well-funded by David Shaw's fortune. Reasonable work hours. Almost all of the non-management employees are bright and a pleasure to work with. Attractive private or semi-private offices. Compensation is good by NYC standards. David Shaw himself is a brilliant, sincere, and inspiring leader. If you land in the right niche, this might be a great job.","There appears to be no functioning mechanism to remove toxic managers, and they are poisoning the organization. Turnover is high--do your homework. Because funding is essentially infinite, there is no real existential drive to avoid mistakes. There is a culture of backbiting. Almost every day you will hear someone trash another's work, sometimes with glee. Though some of the technology is cutting edge, other parts of it are maddeningly archaic. Advice: As a candidate, you should talk to former employees and have a Plan B. If DESRES doesn't work out, ensure you know what you will do, from a career and financial perspective.","The turnover rate is the canary in the coal mine. All DESRES issues come down to poor or toxic management. Advice would be for Dr. Shaw to hire a trusted management consultant and clean house. Some of the managers are good, but if in doubt better to fire them all than keep a bad apple.",2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0

- Great resources available for tools, equipment, or software to do the work
- Great technical people to work with
- Pay is well above market","- Management is a mess. It is supposedly a 'flat' hierarchy, but it's really a few layers deep. The real draw back is that nobody really knows who's managing who on any given day, so there really isn't a clear chain of command.
- Work/Life balance really means you balance the rest of your life so you can work long hours during the day, more hours at home, and checking in on work all weekend. Many people work from vacations, including from international trips!
- No real vacation policy, so it's at the whim of your direct supervisor.
- Senior management (which supposedly doesn't exist in the flat org chart) clearly has plans that aren't disseminated to the non-management people.
- Plans constantly change on large scales that cause huge shifts in priorities and often cost time, effort, and money.
- There doesn't seem to be a real direction for the whole operation that is readily apparent.
- Company seems more focused on perks like fancy parties, free coffee, and free food on occasion than about real employee satisfaction.
- The hiring process is horridly over complicated and though they claim they hire 'superstars' (like many companies these days) they really just hire really smart and talented people willing to work massive hours (often 70 - 90/week).
- No written review process - annually, quarterly, or in any other way.","- Institute a real org chart that shows who is a manager of which employees
- Include employees on the real company goals instead of only talking about the technical achievements and plans.
- Stop wasting so much time and money on massive parties and useless perks and invest in your employees real life balance.
- Change the hiring practices so enough people get hired to do the work rather than wasting months (or years!) trying to fill a position that is desperately needed in the near term with someone who will simply be overworked. Hire two really smart people and let them work more reasonable hours instead of hiring one really smart person willing to kill themselves for their job. You'll do better in the long run.
- Decouple operations from the finance organization completely.",1.0,1.0,2.5,4.0,1.0,
