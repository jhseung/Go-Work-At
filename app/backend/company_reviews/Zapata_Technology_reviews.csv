2017-07-24,,,Current Employee ,Love coming to work every day,Love coming to work every day,0,The culture at Zapata has focused on putting together a great group of people that excel at their jobs. I feel very lucky working here.,"They are results focused, and employees are expected to produce and do their job well. I would not recommend this place for slackers.",Keep up the great work of a quickly growing company!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2017-07-17,,,Current Employee ,Innovative and Growing Company!,Innovative and Growing Company!,0,"Great company if you like taking charge of your own career, hold yourself accountable, work well with teams, want to be the best at everything you do (or try to) and don't like micromanagement and having too many bosses,. Culture means more to Zapata than high performers that are difficult to work with, which is great for teams. The management team is open to suggestions and operates in a ""flat-organization manner"" vice hierarchical.

Very innovative and actually listens to the techs and provides them with the management support to execute their ideas

Compensation is very generous

Work/life balance is top notch, but requires you to be diligent, not for everyone

If you want to do more with your career than what you are currently, there are plenty of opportunities to do so (e.g., business development or programming), if it benefits the company and doesn't interfere with your current responsibilities","Working for a small business can be tough on some, so know that it's a big boy/girl environment, slackers are not welcome. Again, great for those wanting to grow and excel in their career with a company that is growing fast, but not for those that want a 9-5 with bosses telling them how to do their job.",Keep it up.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2017-03-29,,,Former Employee ,Terrible company.,Terrible company.,0,"A pay check every week.
You never get to meet the terrible management that will eventually terminate you without a second thought.","Terrible medical plan.
No tuition reimbursement. They may claim they have it, but when you go apply for it and you about to receive it, then they will terminate you, so they don't have to pay out the money.
They will lie and say you were fired, when it was a lay off.
The company is just a glorified hiring agency.
Don't take the job. Just say no.",Shut down your company.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

2016-07-11, Field Service Analyst/Database Administrator,,Former Employee ,Great Company / Smart People,Great Company / Smart People,0,"Zapata is THE BEST Company I have ever worked for, and I have been in the workforce for 30 years. When I say THE BEST, I’m not generalizing. Zapata is THE BEST in Salary and Benefits, HR and Management, and collective intellect. Randall Zapata is a tech-savvy CEO with a genuine interest in producing the highest quality of product. Employees are fully vetted and trained, and are encouraged to collaborate to ensure technical knowledge is disseminated for the benefit of the contract.","The contracting world. The company works primarily as a sub because of its size, which really is its asset. For that reason, they are dependent upon the primary when it comes to contract bidding and negotiating.",Don’t ever change your management style. Remember who you are as you continue to grow.,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0
2016-07-06, Senior Account Manager,"Atlanta, GA",Former Employee ,Sr. Account Manager,Sr. Account Manager,0,"This company has great people that operate with integrity and expertise. They provide their customers with thorough solutions and a lasting business relationship. Company benefits that stand out from the rest. They support their employees in achieving their goals both in and out of the office.

Great company to work for and to do business with!",Work can slow at times and this can place temporary strain on the company. Sales cycles can run long in the Federal space. This can make supporting new initiatives beyond the core business difficult.,Continue to be Awesome so that more people hear about Zapata and the great things happening there!,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0
2016-07-05,,"Dumfries, VA",Former Employee ,Great company! Great people!,Great company! Great people!,0,"Everyone in the company is very personable. They really care about their employees. The owner even talked with me when I was deciding to pursue my Masters. I ended up choosing his Alma Mater and I'm so glad I did.
The benefits are the best I've seen in contracting. If my contract hadn't ended, I'd still be working for them.",Career opportunities and contracts ending are dependent upon being on the prime or sub contract but that's all contracting. They do try to place you on other contracts if they can.,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
2016-06-27,,,Current Employee ,Phenomenal Small Company,Phenomenal Small Company,0,"Owner is technical and easy to talk to.

HR is pleasant and motivated; both pre-hire and post-hire.

Company culture is very laid back, it is a great environment for those who self-motivate and take initiative.

I work (as most at Zapata do) as a subcontractor, management and support staff work tirelessly and even on the weekends to ensure the I am supported and any hiccups are worked out in a timely manner.

Benefits are great and cost effective.

The company is as close to a meritocracy as is possible in government contracting. Those who go above and beyond are rewarded and recognized for their efforts.

The company offers a discretionary leave policy; so there is no need to bank away leave for a rainy day.

They have always been upfront regarding the statement of work and scope. I had some concerns regarding longevity of a contract; I took those issues to upper management and they collected the facts and addressed my concerns in a prompt and satisfactory time-frame.","Being a small 8a, HUBZone, and SDB; Zapata only has just so many projects to move you to at the end of a contract. However, HR and upper management will do everything they can to be proactive as the end of contract approaches.

With Zapata not being the prime in most of their contracts there are some disconnects with the prime (task leads) as there will inevitably be. This usually manifests itself in not being able to forecast travel and requirements out more than a few months at a time.",Engage employees and foster a sense of pride and ownership. Seek out new contracts and teams to work with. Most of all continue to do what you are doing.,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0
2015-02-25, Web Developer,"Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD",Current Employee ,"Interesting work, however at the mercy of the prime contractor","Interesting work, however at the mercy of the prime contractor",0,"The company has a plan where they pay 100% of your benefits, life/health/dental/vision, etc and the salary I started with was very satisfactory.
Also due to how the company is spread, independent work is the norm.
Work was interesting as well, but affected by the typical slowness that is Government work","The management doesn't really ""connect"" with folks at non-local job sites. Them being based in Georgia means very limited or no contact with contractor-site employees.
They aren't in control of their contracts since they are sub-contractors mostly.",Become the prime contractor in a project so you actually have some say in what happens at the job site,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
2015-01-12, Senior Software Engineer,"Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD",Current Employee ,Small Company that doesn't care about employees.,Small Company that doesn't care about employees.,0,"1) A paycheck.
2) No accountability as long as you keep your mouth shut and don't ever question the prime contractor.","1) Fire and hires employees at the whim of the prime contractor on govt contracts.
2) Hires the cheapest workers without regard to actual skills.
3) Will try and deny you unemployment by lying and stating you got terminated, when in reality you where laid-off.
4) Will ruin your clearance
5) Upper-Management will tell you not to go to the owner of the small company with anything, so they don't look bad.
6) Zapata is not a Technology company.
7) Terminates top employees at the drop of a dime if the prime contractor wants him or her off the contract and makes no attempt to relocate or provide any work.
8) The people you will work with are the bottom of the barrel talent, because they bid the contracts so low and no one that is actually capable will take the job. I had to wake up co-workers several times a day almost everyday and even found one of them sleeping in the car during working hours instead of doing their job, which I needed them to accomplish.
9) I took the lead of the project, worked hard, had a few success, only to get terminated and my security clearance ruined because of the lies this company told the government.","Try to explain to employees that you have no control over the prime-contractor and that no matter what the employee does on-site, under no circumstances, are they to ever disagree with the prime contractor. Be honest with your employees about the position you are hiring them. Understand that the people you have in charge are not relaying employee's concerns to the right people.",1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
