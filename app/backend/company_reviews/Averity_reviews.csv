2017-12-19, Talent Advocate,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,The best company I've ever worked for,The best company I've ever worked for,0,"It's an incredible place to work, and it starts with the culture. It's not just the insane vacation policy, opportunity to hit the gym during lunch every day, the cool music, standing desks, fridge stocked with beer, or the free massages. Everybody here legitimately wants everyone else to be successful, and we collaborate extensively to nurture each other's growth.

Coming from other recruitment agencies, I can say with confidence that things are done differently and better than the competition. We're niche focused and we work with great companies while interacting with smart, interested candidates. We hold ourselves to a standard and close deals without over-relying on KPIs. Most importantly, our work/life balance is unheard of. Where most recruitment agencies pressure recruiters to grind it out until exhaustion, we believe in having lives outside of work and working smart.

Joining Averity is the best decision that you'll ever make. Seriously.","It's still recruiting at the end of the day, which means plenty of ups and downs. You have to have a sales mentality and thick skin to be successful in this industry.",Keep on keepin on!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I've worked in other recruiting firms and what they were lacking in, Averity excels. Everyone genuinely cares about their clients and candidates, and we do whatever it takes to provide exceptional service. Internally, everyone is always helpful, and it's great to be in a team environment. The office is in a good location, there's a stocked fridge, and it's a fun yet productive atmosphere. It's also a great work-life balance, which is hard to find in the staffing industry.","This is not really a con, but there is always work to be done. If you don't have anything to do, then you're not doing enough. It's important to push yourself in order to be successful.",Wine in the fridge!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

2017-03-31,,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,A great place to be,A great place to be,0,"The people there are incredible. They are smart, articulate and extremely intelligent. This is definitely not a standard recruiting firm in NYC. Everyone that interacts with this company are treated with respect and treated like a human being. You feel important.

All of this comes through in the external communication with the people they interact with daily. Averity makes people feel like a name, not a number.

The work environment is casual, comfortable, and 100% flexible. Take lunch when you're hungry, go to the gym when you want to, leave when you're work is finished, take a vacation anytime you want for as long as you'd like. This is probably why the employees also go above and beyond to deliver a superior level of service. No one there gets the Sunday night demons or a case of the Mondays. People look forward to coming to work.

They volunteer their time at the NYC Food Bank and Habitat for Humanity. They have team building events and read books that talk about customer service and building relationships for life.

All anyone in the recruiting business seems to talk about is the ""potential"" for income. People there are compensated extremely well, but Averity is so much more than that. It really is a different place to be.

Oh yea, tie all this together with an innovative and tope tier technical environment. No wonder people at Averity love what they do and the people they work with.",There really isn't a downside.

Averity has direction and focus with a collective knowledge base spanning many years that you can rely on and grow from. Personal growth is encouraged and part of the overall mission in this people to people business.",I don't have a particular con I can think of. I would just say don't take the position for granted. At the end of the day you need to perform and are held to acting like an adult putting in your collective effort as a team. You are encouraged and support every step of the way.,More granola bars!

2014-12-15, Talent Advocate,"New York, NY",Current Employee ,Great Place to Work,Great Place to Work,0,"Averity is a great place to work. Founded by Chris Allaire, who has over 15 years of experience in the field, the work atmosphere is fun, fast-paced, interesting, and encouraging. Not only is the team well compensated for their hard work, but employees actually look forward to coming to work every day. Further, the atmosphere is extremely professional, and the company places a large emphasis on this in an effort to help separate itself from other firms in the area.

Averity also places a large emphasis on developing and maintaining strong and meaningful relationships both with the companies it works with, as well as with the great talent that comes to it every day. The company firmly believes in interpersonal relationships on both sides, and places this above all else.

I would highly recommend working at Averity. Not only do I feel extremely well rewarded for my hard work and time spent here, but I also look forward to the career advancement the company offers. The overall benefits are great, and the company is introducing fun, innovative benefits all the time to keep its employees happy.

Finally, this is one of the best companies I've worked for, and I can't wait to grow with it along with the amazing team that is coming on board.","The atmosphere is fast-paced and hard work is expected at all times, and every day you can look forward to being challenged.",,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
