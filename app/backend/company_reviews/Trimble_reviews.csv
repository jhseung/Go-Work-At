-Overall Trimble seems like a good company to work for","“This is the worst place I’ve ever worked” was a common sentiment that I heard from many different members of the organization while working at VSS. The negative sentiments towards the organization were driven by a lack of basic business management best practices, such as creating a clear direction and regularly rewarding employees for meeting goals that moved in that direction. Overall work was driven by seemingly ad-hoc requests that lacked clarity and purpose rather than providing clear requirements that were written down in a project plan. Furthermore, there was a general lack of vision and strategy that was shared across the business and engineering teams. Software engineers spent a good deal of time working on tasks that they thought were in alignment with the business strategy only to be questioned as to why they had spent time working on that task and then disparaged for not getting any ""real"" work done. As you could imagine, a significant number of software engineers have quit out of frustration, many of them not even lasting a year in the organization.","Your employees are trying to work with you, not against you.

New hires receive minimal training and are expected to figure out things on their own. “Asking too many questions” is viewed as lack of independence.

* Jamming out features seems to be more important than quality.

* There is lots of firefighting. As a result, production services are down many hours per year, and no one seems to care.

* Teamwork and collaboration is actively discouraged. It seems as if management views collaboration as something that interferes with productivity rather than enhancing it.

There are lots of very smart people working there, and in general, I'd say it's a fairly well run company. In my opinion, the main pro's are:
-The people were great. All of my coworkers were great people, and there is a ton of talent there. Everyone is outgoing and makes you feel welcome.
-The CEO and many other executives seem like very genuine people. Trimble seems to have far better morals than many companies.
-The technology there is cutting edge. It can be a steep learning curve, but the talent and technology are second to none.
-The office was very new when I joined, but that may not be the case across the company.
-Geographically and ethnically diverse. You get to travel to many places you'd otherwise never get to visit. You also get to work with people from a variety of countries and backgrounds which I found to be very rewarding.
-The geospatial industry is great, so I enjoyed my time at Trimble.
-There is a gym at the office which was convenient.
-Salary and benefits were competitive, but not overly generous either.","Although I'd say there were more pros than cons, Trimble isn't perfect. My main complaints would be:
-Layoffs seem to be very common. It seems like there were layoffs prior to every quarterly statement. I suppose this is one of the downsides of a publicly traded company, but over time it makes you uneasy every quarter.
-Lots of politics. Each division within Trimble (there's a ton of divisions in the company) operates basically independently, so getting alignment amongst divisions is often very difficult and time consuming.
-No decisions are made quickly. Product managers don't seem to have very much authority, so at times it can make you feel more like a messenger than a manager.
-Trimble has traditionally been a market leader in some verticals, so you do get a sense of arrogance at times.
-Way too many reorgs. In 3 years, I had 5 different managers. Very hard to form a relationship with a manager when you have a new one every few months.
-Geography can be a problem. Our division was spread across the globe, so I only had access to my manager (and other teams i worked with) a couple hours a day.
-Not a 9-5. If you expect to only work during business hours, Trimble is not the place for you.
-No bonuses or other supplemental compensation. You do get profit sharing, but that only amounts to a couple hundred dollars a quarter. Not very generous given the time commitment you have to make.
-Annual review structure needs to be reworked. There were so many reorganizations during my 3 years with the company I never actually had an official review. Hard to gauge your performance with no feedback.
-The manager who hired me was a great mentor, but after that person was laid off, there was very little career advice.
-There are no offices (regardless of position), so the office atmosphere can be very distracting.","-Stop reorganizing the company every quarter.
-Be better about mentorship and feedback. When you go 3 years without an annual review/feedback, thats a problem.
-Make better decisions with hiring. You shouldn't have to reduce headcount every quarter. This is mostly like due to poor forecasting, but there were tons of talented people that were laid off due to cost cutting.
-Give more decision making authority to managers.
-Don't be so cautious. Fear of cannibalization drives more decisions than opportunity.
-Provide bonuses other than just profit sharing. A couple hundred bucks a quarter isn't much incentive to go above and beyond.
-Don't lost the ""start-up"" mentality. The casual and flexible atmosphere is definitely something Trimble is doing right. Don't ever change that.",4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

""They pay so they are right"" mentality.","Was given 2 weeks notice to find Day Care for my son (during Christmas break). Told to travel a hour to and from work. Before Trimble bought my company, I was able to work from home, have my own place, pay my bills, take care of my son (single parent). Since Trimble bought the company I worked for, I was forced to put my son in day care, travel, lose all my overtime, lose the actual Holiday schedule I had and am forced to use my own PTO if I wish to have those holidays now off. Went from feeling like a person in a company that cared to feeling like a report on a piece of paper and as long as I stay above the line I am good.

2017-05-22,,"Westminster, CO",Current Employee ,Not bad if you need resume padding and don't mind low pay/no raises,Not bad if you need resume padding and don't mind low pay/no raises,0,"No long hours: Most people don't work 40 hours/week, and most departments seem very flexible.

Skill building: Many departments are using one or more current/popular technologies, so that can help with resume building if you need that.

People: some of the people are great to work with.","Low pay: pay is very low, and many people are lied to in order to get them hired. The CEO gives each manager 3% raise money for all of his/hers employees per year. Oversimplified, if you get 4% your coworker just got 4%. They use a lot of H1-Bs and foreign workers to keep salary costs down.

Distracting working space in Westminster: The building is attractive looking but very distracting due to its open arrangement. Culture on all floors is interrupt when you feel like it, and meetings are plentiful and rarely produce any work. Management seems to ignore that meeting culture is prevalent and ineffective. Most meetings do not have an agenda and if they do, the results are not implemented.

Poor management: I have worked in a lot of different places in Trimble, and all of them have had too many cooks in the kitchen. Management seems to suffer from changing goals every few weeks to months, with no clear leader and seldom management is held accountable. Management and Marketing control most of what the engineers do, and usually do not listen to common sense. Much of management lacks basic technical skills and domain knowledge skills. Most of software development is done trying and failing to adhere to agile. The amount of managers and marketing people is overwhelming, especially in some departments. Software engineers will have 2-6 people in between them and the customer, never meet the customer, and be subject to the current infighting between managers and marketing. The company is very slow moving. You may get to work on current technologies but expect it to take a lot longer than normal - closer to government work than private sector speeds.

People: Many in middle management or similar positions have worked for the company for far too long. It seems like many people strive for job safety by creating difficult solutions, not documenting hardware or software, or making special, non-standard solutions to easy problems. It is also very hard to get good people hired. Trimble doesn't pay very well. Combine that with a very long interview process with internal recruiters that are not technical at all and that means there are rarely good candidates to choose from. Indian teams are utilized very frequently for software and tend to do very poor work. Indians that are brought over on H-1B seem to be much better and quicker.

Morale: Layoffs happen fairly frequently and are handled very poorly. Management will announce it once it has happened but will not go into any details. You won't know who was laid off or even how many people. Layoffs happen, in most cases that I have seen, when the business sectors are still highly profitable but below wildly inaccurate estimates.

Horizontal integration: Trimble has many different businesses, and none of them talk to each other well. The verticals keep to themselves and many times design the similar/same solutions, hardware, and software for different businesses. Acquired businesses do not seem to be absorbed very well and tend to operate as separate entities with a few notable exceptions.","Hold everyone accountable. Make the organization more flat. Close the gap between the people designing firmware/software and the customer. Start giving raises over 3% and seeking excellent employees. Stop making it so hard to hire people and stop making every requisition go up to the CEO. If you don't trust your underlings to do a good job, hire new people.",2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

The team consisted of smart, talented and good people. This was back in early 2013. Then most of them left.

There were a lot of opportunities to do different kinds of development work at SketchUp which makes the place dynamic and creative. People were generally open-minded and there was a sense of camaraderie there. People wanted to help others.

Generally speaking, SketchUp has good coding practices, but it depends on what team you work for. I've met some great people working there and created some friendships too.

But, it's a mixed bag.","SketchUp can be a great place to work but it depends who you're working with. I suppose that's true of all companies.

Code Reviews: I have mixed feelings about this. We used to adhere to our style-guide, but that changed in the last few months on 3D Warehouse. We used to value quality over quantity, but that changed too. Unit testing was a priority, but not so much anymore. We also had a pretty close-nit team but that didn't last.

I worked there for just under 4 years and in that time I had 5 tech leads, and 4 managers. A lot of turnover. It seemed the longer I worked there, the more office politics and power struggles came into play. It's unfortunate, because I used to be a very happy employee there and believed in the company. Not anymore.

My team came under its most recent new management change sometime around the early part of 2016 and I really don't think these guys know/knew what they're doing. They had never been in management positions before. As a result, they certainly didn't foster a good team vibe and they really took on a dictatorial management style which didn't work for me. They threw our style-guide on the floor and ignored the collaborative culture we used to have. Not cool.

Maybe this has to do with the Trimble acquisition as well. SketchUp used to fly under the Google banner. But, upper management made some pretty bad decisions about who would lead the 3D Warehouse team and things really deteriorated as a result.

I hope they can figure things out.","Make sure the people you put in management positions actually know how to manage people! Managers need to have excellent communication and people skills. Putting technical people in management roles is not always a good thing.

Managers need to listen to their employees. Shutting them down will not foster a positive working environment and will not earn your trust.

Many executives here are ""accidental managers"" and were often promoted 10-20 years ago from technical positions. I can't see where many execs here ever had any training (initially or ongoing) about how to manage people or projects, so they just seem to ignore a lot of people management issues and hope they go away. Eventually the nail that sticks up will get hammered down, because many execs here seem to be more concerned with self-preservation than moving the company ahead.

HR is extremely weak, and I believe that's by design, not by HR choice. Change is very slow. Flying ideas up the flagpole often get completely ignored. For a company this size middle management has very little power or decision making authority. Most decisions seem to be made very secretively at the executive level only and then passed down from the top without much explanation or rationale for the decision.","Bring some flesh blood in to the executive ranks.

- Stock option plan.","- The company is almost 40 years old. And it shows both within the building's infrastructure and the attitude of its employees. A culture of change is strongly needed as everything is compartmentalized and it is strongly reflected by the lack of communication between key departments (i.e. Finance and Information Systems).
- It is a dreadful place for young people who are looking to start their career or are in their mid-late 20s to work there: you don' go to Trimble to further your career; you go to Trimble as a last resort option. Your career essentially stagnates and dies. It's also not a very well respected company in the Bay Area although it's been around for 40 years.
- Because the company is so old and so many workers (I would say over 50% to 60% have been working there for at least 5-7 years) the culture is absolutely repulsive. It's the ""Old Boys' Club"" kind of attitude you'll get from your co-workers who have no interest in getting to know you personally or professionally -- unless they are required to.
- Management is clueless. My position was ""experimental"" but never told that it was so. I was essentially a guinea pig for a miserably failed experiment.
- The acquisitions are an absolute mess leaving projects open for years-on-end in terms of integration.
- No bonuses or upward mobility in terms of the ""corporate"" ladder.
- The stock prices are very volatile given that their core market (Agriculture) has a very uncertain look for the future.
- Depending on your position, the ""Work/ LIfe Balance"" pros are not true. If you have a job that's close to six-figures or within the six figure range, there is no work/life balance. Expect your typical 9-12 hour days.

Well at Trimble the left hand does not even know that the right hand exists. Trimble is a fractured company with far flung groups that it has purchased all doing their own thing with limited input from corporate. It makes it difficult to know what resources are available (or how the company does things), especially since they seem to like to run lean and mean, meaning that no one has time to communicate and tell how things are done are what resources are available.

In the last 15 years HR has been a revolving door with VPs because the CEO gives them no power. And overall, the company is very autocratic. Very smart and capable 'sector VPs' are puppets to the CEO when it comes to employees and their development. Promotions are very few. Raises are very low. The company clearly would rather higher new talent at 40 percent higher salaries than promote from within. Not that they don't promote from within. But it's very few cases, it's always only someone on the CEOs small list of liked people. With that said, new opportunities for advanced roles and responsibilities are pretty good. You'll just work more hours and keep the same salary and title. The CEO thinks people will stay for 10 years because 'the company is doing well'. Also, the independent business unit concept doesn't work well. There are 50 business units and the CEO has taught them to focus on their own business and not the greater good. On paper, the independence sounds great. In practice the CEO is in denial about the poor non unified culture it fosters.","Trimble must have a real employee development program. The culture is one of financial prudence and unyielding focus on 20 percent profit margins. But that must not get in the way of promoting people and giving them 20 to 30 percent increases once they earn those promotions. Don't lock the company into a 3 percent merit pool for raises that also includes promotions. Promotions should fall into the budget for new hires, not the budget for raises. Easy math. CEO needs to retire. His business focused yet non employee focused culture is really hurting any future growth of this company. He's been there too long for that to ever change while he's in charge.

Trimble as a whole is a good company to work for. It is stable and it seems like the company tries not to lay people off during hard times. To save money they do mandatory company shut downs for the 4th of July, Thanksgiving and Christmas. While this is a hit to employee's PTO it's a good opportunity to take some time off and spend with the family. I have received a lot of good training courses and certifications during my time here, which is a major bonus. Trimble also has many good internal training courses such as Lean and Six Sigma. The good work environment and the very flexible schedules help to offset some of the cons, but not all. The health insurance used to be premium coverage but it's gotten a lot more challenging in recent years. I imagine this is due more to the health care industry as a whole.","In my position I do not have a lot of contact with upper management at the Corporate level and I've come to ignore most Corporate media propaganda about how great Trimble is. The salary leaves a lot to be desired and there really isn't much opportunity to move around in the organization to get a raise. If one wants to move into a new position, it will be a lateral move, with more work and same pay. The base annual performance based increase is 2%. Within my business division there is obvious ""who you know"" and not ""what you know"" who get promotions and salary increases. Even with the many training and certifications as well as successfully completed projects that had major impacts for the organization, I still keep receiving the same 2% raise every year. If there isn't any opportunity for self improvement through learning something new about a new technology or product, it just isn't worth it to do a major project at this point.","Even though our employee survey told management that we didn't like the ""who you know"" mentality within our business division, management continues the same behavior.
