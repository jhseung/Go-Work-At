- One man controls the entire organization and he is not the CEO
- Bait and Switches. Most commonly seen with promises made to physicians and then once 'buy-in' is achieved, the plans change. This leaves physicians feeling duped and lower level management having to clean up the mess.
- Physicians who have been with the organization forever, have several ""gentleman's agreements"" funneling $$$ into their wallets, while everyone else is given peanuts seen in the form of a 1-5% raise annually. 5% are never given because no one can possibly be exceptional and if they are HR makes it impossible requiring multi VP approval?!
