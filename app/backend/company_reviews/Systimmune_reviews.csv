2017-10-26,,,Current Employee ,Lack of direction and trust is discouraging.,Lack of direction and trust is discouraging.,0,"-Excellent scientists and technicians with great experience and technical knowledge.
-Fairly good equipment and tech setup for such a small company.","-Upper management is inexperienced in the full process of biotech drug development and it shows. Constant requests/demands to shorten timelines and cut out developmental milestones, with no justification offered.
-Scientific integrity is becoming questionable, with senior management asking for ""tests to prove X will do Y"" instead of asking a question and seeing what results the tests produce.
-Little time is allowed for documentation, both in daily work and in writing larger reports and other supporting technical documents for transfer or later filings.
-Strange budgetary decisions - OK to buy a new mass spectrometer, but not OK to pay for a day's parking at the airport for an employee flying to a seminar and back in that one day.","Listen to your scientists and trust them - you hired them in order to get the benefit of their years (or decades!) of experience, so utilize these resources. Explain why you want to cut timelines and throw out basic development, and how these risks will be handled moving forward.",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0
