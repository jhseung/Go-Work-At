The powers that be lord over their departments like a fiefdom from Medieval times. Human resources allowed too much inappropriate behavior over the years by employees and there is little chance of change until a major revamp of the department, starting at the top of the department. Plus, do not expect much advancement either. They are more likely to hire from outside than promote from within, unless you are a favorite of a VP or the president.

- also, the CEO has favorites. and they change. when you are no longer a favorite you might as well leave. when you are a favorite you move from volunteer to VP in a matter of five years.
- unrealistic expectations. you're expected to work 60-70 hours for pay below the museum average but just be grateful you work for the Adler.
- the Adler does not plan ahead for anything. As much as you try to plan out ahead of time, they refuse to work as a cohesive team and plan an exhibition, event, or even a gala and it's detailed out in advance. this brings so much stress across all departments.
- you will end up taking on extra work with no job title change or compensation. And apparently should be grateful for it.
- the benefits are sad. the insurance costs so much it hurts.

If there are serious money problems, why do a major renovation to a gallery that didn't need it?

However, the new management appears to have no experience delivering programs to the public and is motivated by improving the short term financial situation without a plan for the long run.

I was at the Adler for two years spanning a year of the previous President and a year of the new one (Michelle B. Larson) and was in a relatively senior (director-level) position the whole time.

I can honestly say that the Adler was in very bad shape when I arrived. There was no strategic leadership, the senior team were all at war with each other and the was a serious 'siloing' problem. Basically different departments didn't talk to each other or trust each other - this seemed to be the result of more than a decade of poor leadership.

All that has happened over the past year is that a *real* leader has entered the building and is shaping a vision for a museum of the 21st century. Adler was doing waaaay too much before and in my opinion none of it very well. The new president is refocussing the Adler into being a much more exciting, relevant and engaging venue.

Your employment allows free shows and admission for you and any of your friends or family, and free admission in to any of Chicago's museum. You also receive discounts for parking near the planetarium (no employee parking area) and discounts in the gift shop and cafeteria of the planetarium.

You also are able to deal with people from all around the world, as the museum is ""world class."" Usually, these people aren't rude or inconsiderate because they are there to have a good time and to expand their minds. I personally enjoyed talking to these tourists on a daily basis. Even though the job is mostly telling a visitor where the nearest bathroom is or where they can find a certain theater, I really had fun approaching the visitors and answering their questions.

The other great thing about this position is the flexibility of the hours. You aren't required to work more than 3 days a week, and you can choose which 3 days you'd like to work, and at what time. Make sure to choose only the days you want to work when first applying, otherwise you will have a widely varying work schedule. Sometimes you get to work an evening event, which is usually a wedding. Weddings are great at the planetarium, and if you're lucky, you get to indulge in some of the food at the end of the night.

Spending a long time in a musem, you are also able to pick up some knowledge that you may have missed by just visiting it. If you are intellectual, you'll pick up most of the knowledge the museum has to offer within a week or two. If you aren't, don't worry, because intelligence isn't necessary for the position.","This is strictly for the MSS position. The job pays barely over minimum wage, and you are no more than a talking sign. If you are an intelligent, mature person, this position is not for you. You will be bored and will be itching for something more to do after a few weeks of working here.

The job requires a lot of standing and a lot of talking which in itself is not a con. But what makes it bad is that you are never allowed to leave the spot you are standing in, even if it is to get a drink of water. You can ask for permission to receive a two-minute relief, in which you are not allowed to get a drink of water, have a smoke, make a call, feed an expired parking meter, grab a snack, or talk to other staff members. This is compounded by the fact that several of your shifts will be just short enough that they will not have give you a break during your entire shift. That means close to six hours of standing and talking without being allowed to have a drink of water.

It seems to be almost a consensus among the 70+ members of the Museum Services Staff that the required initial training leaves you feeling like you are a child in grade school being yelled at by the teacher. It is a very demeaning program that teaches you everything you can't do on the job. Also, every word coming out of your mouth during this training sessions must be word-for-word as what is scripted, and any deviation will get you reprimanded by the trainer. Any luxuries you can claim as an adult is also lost during the training program. You must act like a perfect grade school student who kisses up to the teacher, otherwise you will be belittled by the trainer. Again, this seems to be a concensus among the MSS employees.

They claim that their break policy is very generous; 45 minute break if you work over 6 hours, and a 2 breaks if you work work over 12 hours. What they do not tell you is that they work those break ranges to their limits when assigning you shifts. For instance, they will make you work a 5hr 45 min. shift so that they don't have to give you a break, or they will give you a 11 hour shift, so they don't have to give you a second break.

My biggest qualm about this job is that the job is more about what you CAN'T do, rather than what you can do. You can't have a cell phone on you, or you will be fired. You can't talk to other employees while you are working, you can't drink water, you can't be on the clock while using your locker, you can't refer to a handicapped person as handicapped, and you can't stick out compared to the average person. There are much more CAN'Ts than CANs when working this position, as you will find out if you get through training, which many people do not. It takes a certain kind of person to work this position, and intelligence, maturity, or professionalism isn't one of the criteria. If you can be a robot with no freedoms for 5-13 hours a day, you're set.","Lose the training program. I went through the two week training program led by the trainer, only to learn the scripts and the restrictions that you must abide to. It was only until I began working actual shifts that I learned what the job really entails, at which point I realized it is not for me. The money wasted for the first two weeks training me in the classroom could have been saved if I had just been put with a training partner on the floor from day one, where I learned the most about how to do my job well.

Your trainer and restrictive policies has scared off some very intelligent and extremely personable employees, which has left you with a force of staff that are merely robots. You can see it in their faces when they are dealing with with the visitors. The reviews you have read about your planetarium and their employees are wholeheartedly true. Many of the senior members of the MSS have a look of complete apathy when dealing with the visitors. When a visitor asks a question, I see many senior MSS members simply state one of their scripted lines with no emotion or acknowledgment of the visitor. You are breeding this type of employee with your restrictiveness. Time to ease your policies towards your employees, like other departments of the planetarium.",2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,

It would also be a good idea to stop playing favorites and blatantly disrespecting people that work hard for you but that don't smile in your face all day everyday while telling you every little detail of their lives. New management is definitely needed. This place has a very arrogant management team that looks down on people.
