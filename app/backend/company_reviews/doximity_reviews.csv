2018-10-23,,,Former Employee ,"Great people, decent culture, struggling leadership",,0,"- Overall a fun place to work. Great people who are competent, know how to get things done, and know the importance of having a good time.
- An individual's success/enjoyment may depend on their team's style. The overall culture is appealing. But, if you're interviewing, try to understand how your team approaches its process and internal management. What are the expectations? How will they support your growth?
- The perks are legitimate, but anyone can find something they don't care for or wish could be better. We all have our share of suggestions. Many of them seem to be taken into consideration. Some are not.
- A very promising business model, and the company proves its value quarter after quarter.","- Number one is lack of trained management/leadership. High-growth company hadn't figured out the gravity of training leaders well.
- Related, no clear path for growth/advancement.
- Also related, though the culture is positively tangible, it can seem like numbers/success come before people. Sometimes perks act like a pacifier, but developing employees takes dedicated, hard work.
- Secondly, expectations for individuals are unclear.

All of this revolves around a lack of self-awareness among management. It's one thing to put your head down and get the work done. Having fun here and there is great. But when leadership doesn't learn how to truly put people first, employees burn out.","- Focus on developing good managers, who can then develop good employees.

2018-10-01, Software Engineer,"Whitefield, NH",Current Employee ,Once in a lifetime company,More than 3 years,0,"The leadership is second to none, and everything follows from leadership. I've been in the industry for 15+ years and I've never seen such genuine, smart, capable, successful and humble senior management. Their effect on the rest of the company is tangible (or should I say ""Tangney-ible""; yes, that just happened). No task or person is too small, it's very rare and refreshing.
Other than that, it's just a joy to get up and be able to work here every day. My tasks are meaningful, we have all the tools we need to get things done efficiently, and there's no time wasted in meetings or otherwise.
The only downside is that it will be hard to top this. Even if someone offered me a stupid amount of money, I'd probably pass. You can't buy being happy at your job, and feeling like you're part of a big family that all truly care about one another.","Absolutely none.

2018-07-27, Software Engineer,,Current Employee ,A true pearl in a sea of Startups,More than a year,0,"Doximity has truly perfected the semi-remote office environment. I am one of many employees (from around the world) that works remotely, and I must say, this has been one of the most pleasant experiences; and it may just be a testament to the quality of people that work here, but my working hours (and well-being) are sincerely respected by every single person. There are four off-sites a year where everyone gets together to relax and reflect on our accomplishments and establish goals; and these are a real treat after months of remote work where you don't get face-time with the team.

From an engineering point of view, there is never a dull moment. At this point, the entire process is a well-oiled machine. Teams are broken into small groups of no more than 10, work is broken up reasonably (yet still challenging) into quarters, and the technology stack continues to grow in some bleeding-edge stuff. There is a yearly stipend to learn new things and attend conferences to keep your brain juices flowing. The best thing I find about working here is the personal consideration of my growth. If I want to lead a team, kick off new tech, better our process, or just take it easy for a bit, my voice is heard and offered the opportunity.

Financially, salary is competitive, the medical benefits are impressive, yearly bonus, potential spot-bonuses from co-workers, and a stake in an incredible company with some nice legs.","At times, goals can be set at a pretty high bar that can lead to some stressful end-of-quarter rushes.",Continue hiring great people and supporting a remote-working mentality.

2016-07-28,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Fun, motivated team",More than 3 years,0,"Vision – Healthcare is ripe for improvement and it’s inspiring to work for a company that is tackling real problems. The CEO is a visionary and gracefully walks the fine line of being a leader without micromanaging.

Ownership – Everyone has a big part in the company’s success. At our weekly all hands meetings you hear about work that’s being done. It gives us an appreciation of the different pieces needed to make a company tick. Quarterly goals are measured across all teams, which is also refreshing.

Upside – Doxmity has a really bright future, which is fantastic. But an even bigger upside is that employees get support to personally grow. I’ve seen many people get hired for one job and transition to a dream role they never new existed.",It’s a face-paced environment that runs on a pretty lean team.

2016-07-15,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Stability of An Established Company + Culture of a Startup,More than 5 years,0,"This is a company that cares about its mission and its employees. Strong growth and very positive long-term prospects give it the stability of a more established company, but it has the culture and perks of a fun, young startup.

Management listens and responds to employee requests & ideas. Teams are collaborative and lack the hierarchy that tends to add red tape and aggravation at other companies. Goals are ambitious and productivity is rewarded.

Moreso than at any other place I've worked, employees genuinely like and respect each other. There are no jerks here. Also very few egos. People take their work seriously but don't take themselves seriously, which is a rare and amazing combo.

Doximity does a good job of ""hiring slow and firing fast."" Non-performers aren't given a chance to stick around and poison the well for the rest of us, which is hugely appreciated. Turnover is very low and those who work hard and perform well are able to rise quickly into leadership roles.

Jeff (CEO) is strategic, smart, and sincere. He has a proven track record and has helped Doximity avoid many of the typical startup pitfalls by putting his experience into proactive decisions for the good of the company. He is very approachable and is open with employees about company goals, prospects, and trajectory, which breeds a culture of honesty and openness. Employees trust and respect him, and he trusts and respects employees.","I honestly don't have any complaints about this company. When growing pains happen, they are very quickly remedied.
That said, Doximity is not for everyone. If you are someone who craves a corporate environment with many levels of management and corner offices, you probably won't be very happy here. Managers are quite hands on and work hard at Doximity (there are no ""paper pushers"" here). Our CEO sits in the open office floorplan with everyone else.",Continue to trust employees and maintain a collaborative culture as we scale.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
