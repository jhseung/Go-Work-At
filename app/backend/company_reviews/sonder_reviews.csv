I have a clear understanding of what is expected from all teams.

I am not sure what to say about the strongly-worded negative reviews. My experience is limited to the engineering team, but I've never felt overlooked or overworked. As for the discussion of not vesting, I feel there should always be an understanding that vesting is not unlike an optional clause to extend a contract -- if you've proven your worth, you should never expect to be let go.

At the end of the day, we are helping travelers experience the world by redefining hospitality. It's a good gig.","We have no infrastructure to train inexperienced engineers.

2018-11-01, Head of Real Estate,"Phoenix, AZ",Former Employee ,Not worth it,Less than a year,0,"Lunch reimbursement, working remotely, travel credits","My experience at Sonder started off promising and ended with me abruptly quitting. I reached a breaking point and decided my mental health was more important than a job. I was repeatedly spoke to in a demotivating and demoralizing way and my manager threatened my job multiple times. I asked him many times to stop speaking to me in this manner. He tried to use fear tactics as a means to motivate me. He repeatedly told me I was expected to work 75+ hours a week, that I wasn’t meeting expectations, and that I didn’t have hustle (and you can’t teach hustle). At times his behavior would improve, but ultimately he would revert back to speaking to me in a way that I’ve never been spoken to in my 15 year career history. I felt like he used gas-lighting techniques to make it seem like I was making all of this up. He told many lies to me (as I confirmed with HQ) regarding concerns about my perceived lack of performance. Everyday felt miserable, not knowing which personality of his would be showing up.

I had multiple interventions, over a span of several weeks, with HQ about his behavior towards me. I told them it was affecting my work performance, my personal life, my mental health, and some of the things he said to me were borderline discriminatory. I certainly don’t think he would’ve spoken to a man the way he spoke to me. One of the last conversations I had with HQ about his behavior resulted in me asking them “how many more times do I have to have this conversation with you before action is taken against him?”. At that point, I felt it was clear they were going to allow this behavior to continue because the GM was excelling at his other job duties. I felt defeated.

As far as Sonder goes as a company and their mission, I have mixed feelings. I personally liked all of the people I connected with at HQ. I think one of the difficulties of working remotely from HQ is the isolation. When you only have one local co-worker, and they treat you poorly, it leads to you feeling alone and helpless. I also think Sonder grossly misled me on the commission structure (the one they changed and rolled out 3 months into my job). It was then that it became clear - I wasn’t going to be making the kind of money I was led to believe that I would be making and it definitely wasn’t enough to continue to be treated in an abusive manner.",One bad team member can ruin the entire culture and you need to take action before it gets worse.,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

No. We have to choose between spending a holiday with our families or making enough money to pay rent that month.

Not afraid to take on big challenges in-house. Great balance of ownership and autonomy, while being part of a larger ecosystem that is continuously sharing best-practices in order to learn and grow together. A month can feel like a year in terms of the personal growth achieved.

Conscious efforts on building a culture of transparency, open communication, collaboration; particularly important when at this stage of fast grow and experiencing wide geographical distribution.","Growing so quickly that means of communication need to evolve as well in order to stay efficient. Like in any start-up, need to be able to adapt as things change, new priorities/processes come into play.",Continue: challenging teams while fostering culture of transparency and growth mindset.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
2018-04-25, Director of Operations,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Big tech > Sonder: BEST DECISION EVER.,Less than a year,0,"I spent years working in big tech and felt super unfulfilled - I was supposedly doing ""big"" things, but I was extremely bored. I realized I was just a cog in a big wheel and spent most of my time writing emails to people about what I might do to get buy-in and permission rather than spending time actually executing.

In comes Sonder. I must admit, it was initially a hard sell to leave the comfort of my cushy big tech job and my stock vesting schedule. But as I write this at my 7 month mark at Sonder, I can honestly say that for the first time in by 10+ year career, I love my job.

Why? Sonder provides me with an amazing amount of autonomy and flexibility, a beautiful office, and hardworking coworkers who inspire me to come to work everyday. I spend most of my time actually executing rather than just writing emails. I am faced with intellectually challenging work every day. Most importantly, I leave everyday feeling like I learned something new.

I think this last point bears highlighting. At the end of the day, work is work. Not every day is going to be amazing. There will be bumps in the road. And this is true of every job you are doing to take. What is important, though, is that you feel like you are growing personally and/or professionally each day. I feel like I have grown more in my 7 months at Sonder than my prior 10 years of work.

Other amazing benefits (other than the obvious things like compensation, snacks, free lunches, etc.)
- A full-time executive coach that is available to ALL employees to work on professional and leadership development (I have never heard of a company of this size that offers this kind of benefit)
- A culture that thrives on intellectual creativity and curiosity. Reading is a huge Sonder pastime as evidenced by the hundreds of books we have for borrowing throughout the whole office and the very active bookclub Slack channel
- Flexible work-life balance. Colleagues WFH or elsewhere when they need to, there's an unlimited vacation policy, and there's no face-time policy
- A culture that promotes direct communication rather than triangulation. I feel empowered to express my thoughts and opinions rather than keeping them hidden inside.
- A highly empathetic team. We spend a lot of time talking about how we are feeling and doing. We work hard, but also spend time to ensure everyone is happy and healthy.
- A brand I can get onboard with. We aren't just creating run of the mill hotel rooms at Sonder. We are designing unique spaces for living and enjoying. I am proud of the brand we are building and creating at Sonder.
- A culture of “yes”. At my prior job, my coworkers more often than not were trying to find ways to say “no” to new ideas and initiatives as this often resulted to added workload on the team. This stifled creativity. At Sonder, there is always a forum for new ideas to bubble up and to be worked on.","Hyper-growth mode has its challenges in every company, especially as we grow from an early stage start-up to a mid-stage start-up. Given our distributed operations model of delivering services to our guests in local markets, cross-geographic communication can sometimes be a challenge since half of our company doesn’t sit in HQ.",Continue to focus on delivering an amazing experience for all of our employees and guests!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

It's motivating to see people work so hard, as we are all working toward a common goal.
- Sonder wants to be an industry leader. Not only in the short term rental industry, but in the greater hotel, and hospitality industry.
- Sonder is creating something that has never been done before. This means that everyone, no matter what role they are in, are figuring things out as we go. This gives everyone a lot of responsibility and ownership over their role. This exposure allows for a fast learning curve.
- We have grown at a very fast rate and have the backing from some impressive investors and board members. I have seen a lot of progress in our hiring and operations.
- The perks are great: dental & medical coverage, options, catered lunch everyday, beers and dinner every Thursday, fitness credit, beautiful office","- As with any startup, there is a lot of uncertainty of how things will end up. Even though there are statistics that the hospitality industry does best during a recession, young companies don't always survive.
- Regulations in high tourist cities are tricky and anti-short term rental. This is a pretty big bottleneck for growth.
- There is a bit of a lack of visibility when big decisions are made. This has gotten better over time, but there are still issues here.
- Work-life balance is a little difficult. I find myself working late into the evening and some days over the weekend.","- We need more visibility on upper level-decision making.

2018-04-15, Engineering Manager,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Great place for product-focused engineers,Less than a year,0,"From my view on the engineering team:
- Engineers are given lots of ownership & autonomy. Engineers work directly with other roles in every part of the company, make product & UX decisions, and have a lot of influence on opportunity/feature prioritization.
- The decision-making process regularly returns to a few shared virtues: scrappiness, first-principles thinking, quantitative research, and pursuing focused goals.
- Systems are generally not over-engineered, and tech debt is at a manageable level.
- Travel is frequent but not too frequent. Team members in the San Francisco office often visit city teams, but not to the extent that it feels like you're living out of a suitcase.
- The product can be touched and felt, it's not just pixels on a screen or 1's & 0's in a database.
- Company leadership has an ambitious, well-articulated mission/vision, sets ambitious goals and then beats those goals.","Again, a view from the engineering team:
- Sonder's focus is primarily on operations and it understands this side of the business extremely well. It lacks, however, an equally good understanding of its customers: why they choose Sonder, why they travel in the first place, what problems they experience when they use competing services. We have plenty of theories, but need to develop a true understanding so as not to forfeit it to Airbnb, Booking.com, etc.
- Office technology is weak right now: Wifi is spotty and slow, most conference rooms are unnamed & not bookable, video conferencing is a game of wires/dongles/various video-chat tools, an unpaid Slack account means messages quickly disappear, the wet-erase boards make a mess of your hands and clothes, office dashboards are now mostly powered-off televisions. All easy to fix, we need to Just Do It™.","Maintain the current balance of big vision and focused execution - it's great right now.

2018-04-16, Senior Software Engineer,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,"Breadth of problems, ownership and transparent leadership",More than 3 years,0,"The breadth of problems you get to tackle at Sonder is one of my favourite things about working here. Warehousing & logistics, home automation, operations optimization and consumer web experiences are just a few.

Engineers are given ownership over their projects. So instead of being handed solutions, we work directly with the rest of the company to understand their problems and coordinate solutions across multiple teams.

Outside of engineering, when mistakes are made, senior management owns up to it and looks to course correct. Leadership is transparent about the company's financial situation so there's never doubt about where we stand.","Communication between our primary office and the many city teams has been difficult. Goals are not always aligned which has lead to animosity in some occasions. Since this issue has been identified it looks like the company is moving in the right direction by working on building empathy and better communication channels.

Free lunch.,"CEO is a self absorbed and cocky wanna be Mark Zuckerberg. All C level employees follow his lead. Everyone is afraid to speak up and say how they really feel about the company.

They act like they are changing the world. In reality they are running illegal mini hotels in apartment complexes. By doing so they circumnavigate the rules and regs in each city. This is not Airbnb. At this point they are just operating cheap hotels with furniture that looks nice in photos but is far from it in person. Cheap bedding. Cheap pillows. You dont even get a real comforter.

The company is burning through venture capital money like no tomorrow. They have never even come close to breaking even. They will work you to the bone then complain that you are not working hard enough. The 25 year old CEO will tell you to book an appointment with him via google calendar. Then on purpose he fills up his calendar for 3 weeks out from 6am to 8pm with bs crap to appear like he is so busy and you should be too.

Its all pomp and dance. The whole company is built on a lie. From lying to the developers and apartment manangers that we wont disturb their long term tenants. (Lie. We get calls every single day from owners, developers, and long term traditional renters that have been kept up all night from our guests partying till 3am.) We tell the developers anything they want to hear just so they sign the rental contract with us.

They put potential hirees through the ringer. But in reality if you didn't go to Cornell you are not getting a managerial role. It takes them 4 months to hire managers. Then most of them last for a short time before being canned or bailing because they realize its not what they thought it was.",Get rid of the CEO. He's bad for the company. Your business model is probably not going to end up working in many of the cities you are in. In the meantime start treating your employees like humans instead of robots.

- Pay for transportation","This is going to be long, but I want people to get as much info as they can so they can judge whether this job is right for them. Here we go...

First off, the job description I read online was very different from the job I was told about at my orientation. Had I known that I would be traveling literally all over the city to inspect apartments while lugging around 40lbs in duvet covers and wine glasses, I wouldn't have even applied. I had an extremely hard time learning and doing my job well because --- I wasn't trained! At my orientation I was told that that was info day, and sometime that week I would shadow another HA to learn the job, and get answers any questions I may have. At the end of my orientation, I was sent out into the field to inspect an apartment, and was never trained after that. I had conflict with my main manager due to the fact that I was making mistakes, which caused me to go into every day with extreme anxiety (at all times I felt I could be fired at any moment). Maybe if they had taught me how to do the job, these mistakes wouldn't have happened.

I've worked at a few startups, and I've always noticed that there is a culture of anxiety that impacts every aspect of the company. The office environment was extremely depressing, I hated going there. It was always quiet, and everyone looked extremely somber, tired, and stressed out. The management put quite a lot of pressure on the HAs to complete quality assurance checks (QAs), which was extremely stressful because during my time there, there were only two full time HAs (myself included). The part time ones didn't seem to work even 20h/week. I could never understand why they didn't hire more full time employees, or manage the schedules of the part time employees better. Very disorganized. I would sometimes have three managers talking to me at once, telling me different things. Often times I would be called or messaged about an ""emergency"" (such as a guest getting locked out), only to take an uber, and find that the problem had been resolved, and nobody told me.

There is no HR department, which I find ridiculous. I'm sure this has something to do with the lack of equality/diversity. There were only two women in salaried positions, and all the employees in salaried positions were white. As a person of color, that was one of the first things I noticed when I met everyone on the team. The only people of color I met were doing maintenance, or were HAs. Issues are handled between boss and subordinate, and it is extremely intimidating and uncomfortable. When people were fired, they were given no notice, and I often heard that the person doing the firing was typically pretty rude about it. They need to hire someone that deals with these issues directly.

I found my manager to be condescending, and didn't feel that he took me seriously. There were times when he would reprimand me seemingly out of nowhere - almost always talking down to me. One time that really stood out to me was when he called me to tell me that the order in which I had decided to do my tasks was inefficient, and proceeded to reprimand me the way someone would their child. I assured him that I had chosen the most efficient way based on train and bus schedules (knowing that he either drives or takes the commuter trains, I do resent that he criticized the path I chose when I have been using transportation here all my life), and apologized, to which he simply hung up. 1.5-2h later I had finished my tasks with 3 hours to spare, let him know, asked if there was anything else he needed me to do, and he didn't reply. He didn't talk to me at all the next day, which is honestly so petty.

Another time that stands out was when I asked my managers (both men) a question, and they responded by looking at each other, letting out a quick laugh, and giving me a task to do, completely ignoring my question. I heard a similar complaint from another female HA, but never from any of the male HAs - miraculously, I never heard a complaint about them from any of the male HAs. I always felt like I was being talked at, or someone was trying to educate me - which I really did not appreciate.

Guests constantly complained about how cheap everything was. During a big problem with a guest, my manager disappeared, and left me to deal with everything with little support. The guest referred to him as a coward - which didn't offend me personally, but I really didn't like that I had been put in this position. Management just told the guests what they wanted to hear, telling them that I knew exactly how to fix the problem, when that wasn't true at all. Management seems to be primarily concerned with expanding, and not quality customer service. If you want to be considered a luxury service, provide guests with luxury-quality items (which I'm sure you could afford if you would stop expanding so quickly). After working there, I wouldn't use things like the coffee filters, and I would wash all the towels before using them. You have no idea how many times I've seen these things dropped on the ground (and put back on the shelf) of a storage facility.

15/h is not terrible, but it didn't feel worth it for a few reasons. I was miserable every day of this job, and the anxiety I felt the entire time working here was awful; you can't put a price on mental health. The work HAs do is not rocket science, but it is incredibly draining. I don't think anyone in the management positions really have a grasp on how much time some of the tasks take simply due to travel. I was often asked to take large amounts of supplies - wine glasses, water glasses, draino, an entire pot and pan set, two pillows (yes, this is a real example), and aluminum foil to apartments all over the city. Everything was kept at one place that was in quite a remote location (for a city), so I had no choice but to carry all of these things with me at once. When I asked whether someone with a car could do the task instead, I was ignored. Many times when I got to apartments to drop off ""missing"" items, they were not missing, or someone had replaced them before I had arrived, and nobody told me.

Poor communication. There were several instances when guests would arrive early, and we were not notified, so I ended up going to buildings for nothing.

I was also asked to buy SEVERAL things for units and/or guests. These things are reimbursed, but took sometimes 1-1.5 months to get my money back. I'm a student, and didn't start this job with a ton of money. I frequently had to buy cards, wine, flowers, chocolate, etc..., for guests, and also had to buy things like smell absorbers, laundry detergent, draino, cutting boards, baking pangs, etc.., which are all things they should have plenty of. I couldn't afford to be spending so much, and then wait a month or more for a reimbursement. You shouldn't have to spend money for your job on a regular basis, especially when you're not a salaried worker.

I'm sure there's more I could say, but you get the gist of it.

You will need to push your limits, if you're ready to. Sonder does encourage smart work over hard work at all cost and managers/exec teams do pay attention to the well-being of their employees, they care, and they will be there for you. Of course, you need to talk, right? Else, you should not expect that all your busy colleagues will stop their work to read your mind. You also need to be there for them and for Sonder, right? If you don't and you expect loyalty in exchange, then you missed a chapter on integrity and reciprocity. Building the trust is a bilateral exercise, don't forget it.

Be ready for the ride of your life, I could never have dreamt of a better career move.","If you are looking for a company that has everything structured and figured out already, a company where you will have you career plan all canned for you, then I strongly encourage you to stay where you are and It's perfectly fine like this. We need people in every industry, in every role, in every type/size of companies. It does not mean you are not a smart talented person, it only means that you won't be a good fit for Sonder. Again, don't get me wrong, Sonder has been growing exponentially, while considering all these aspects, but they are not completely refined yet. We are building these right now and will continue to do so, with openness and fierce execution.
Also, if you're looking for coddling and non-stop appreciation, you chose the wrong Company. Sonder does celebrate successes but employees that join a start-up have this tendency to think that it will be like a big fraternity where everyone needs credit for everything, and it's aberrant.
Live up to your standards, do the best that you can, and consider yourself lucky to be part of this great adventure, this is your recognition and it's more than enough, in my view.","Keep being so open to feedback, and keep thinking big!

2018-04-22,,,Former Employee ,Think Twice,More than a year,0,"With a suspiciously large clump of glowing reviews in the past couple of weeks, I think it's necessary to give a more nuanced perspective of the experience of working at Sonder. It's worth noting that most people at the company, particularly based in SF HQ haven't been at the company for even a year, some for far less than that. For all of you in the recruiting funnel ask detailed questions, particularly about retention and turnover.

I spent almost two years at Sonder in a variety of roles. We'll start with the good. Over my time with the company I got to take on a massive level of responsibility in terms of my seniority and to see a company scale to a point that most start-ups will never, ever reach. There's travel and the opportunity to build your own team and processes from the ground-up. As long as you're meeting your goals your manager will often be content to let you do what you want and make genuinely impactful decisions then take the credit for your successes so they can curry favor with the founders in what is an incredibly personalistic organizational structure. Be prepared for a serious lack of transparency and trust. Some people seem to have serial amnesia in terms of promises they've made days or weeks earlier, this includes huge projects announced in front of the whole company. The things you say will rarely make it to the top. I had a number of serious concerns with my direct manager that I brought up over and over again, only to be ignored for no discernible reason.

One of the few bearable aspects of this company is a core group of colleagues who are incredibly bright, friendly, and hardworking. I don't know how you've managed to convince them to stay on, but those friendships and connections were the only way that I could last as long as I did.","I once had a colleague who made the remark that Sonder's real culture is one of ruthlessness and this could not be more true. With exceptions, do not expect to be recognized for your work. Definitely do not expect to be compensated fairly, which is particularly grating when you're working obscene overtime, every single weekend, and contributing to raising fundraising rounds in the tens of millions of dollars. You are a tool on the road to building ""the future of hospitality"". Don't ever forget that you're disposable.

This isn't the case for every team. Don't forget that Sonder is supposedly a TECH start-up. However, that doesn't mean there's a functioning product. Nope, instead, there's an ever-increasing backlog of core features that are completely broken. There are other priorities like flashy, but useless tools to roll out that won't be practical but someone with a bit of clout thought would be cool. This happens a LOT (pun intended for all of you in the know).

At the heart of things, Sonder is a consumer-facing business. Yet, over and over again they under-invested in customer service and cut corners by building a heavy reliance on third-party contact centres and shoddy training. Having used Sonder quite a bit, this was by far one of the weakest parts of the experience, but it was largely neglected by the leadership team. That part of the company felt completely cut off from the rest and I saw extremely abusive language being directed to them by people like City GMs or operations teams more than once.","Working at Sonder has been invaluable in many ways. I wish I could say that this was because of a stellar corporate culture and a supportive manager. Instead, it's been pretty much the opposite experience. It's taught me exactly what type of workplace I'll be striving to avoid for the rest of my career, one that's afraid to be honest with itself and make impactful changes.

There's a lot of positive reviews that slyly, and not so slyly take digs at people who are no longer at the company. Many of these seem to state that those who left couldn't handle the workload, or the hours, or didn't understand the vision. I would hope that such a broad trend of exits would encourage you all to think a bit more critically than that. I didn't spend two years driving myself into the ground because I didn't believe in the product. However, I did leave because my manager treated me like I wasn't worth his time, none of my work was ever acknowledged, and my compensation package was laughable. Unsurprisingly to me, even the more positive reviews mention each of those problems. I genuinely hope that you confront them soon.",1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0

As a part-timer, I had flexible hours while still getting some of the company's benefits, like free meals.
Very pleasant colleagues.","My manager routinely was a terrible man-manager, and oftentimes ineffective at his job. Whether it was letting us know the company was moving to SF a mere 2 weeks after hiring us, working my full-time colleagues extremely hard, or letting me know, by email with no heads up, that he was terminating my contract, he routinely lacked empathy and kindness - not to mention failing to motivate our team.
Upper management was very much absent from the situation, unreachable or otherwise inaccessable.

2017-04-15,,,Former Employee ,"Ambitious company, perfect stepping stone to launch your career",More than a year,0,"I left a while ago but have been thinking a lot about my time at Sonder. Around the same time that I left something like 20 people quit or were fired, many from management positions. Maybe for the same reasons I did or maybe not, but the company had lost most of its best senior people and had scapegoated a lot of more junior ones. It’s possible they were also just running out of money.

Sonder does hire top talent, but all of the senior positions are based in San Fransisco. That is a big pro, though. You will get to work with some very bright and fun people. I always had a really great time working with my team and they’re what I miss about the job. You will also get to meet a lot of people and grow your network quickly.

There are no consequences for making mistakes, and half the time nobody will even notice any mistake for a few months because everybody is running on fumes. It’s a startup with classic founder syndrome. The founders treat it like a 5 person company even though there are over 100 there now, and by trying to keep such a tight grasp on everything they end up having control over nothing. They overlook major strategic problems with the business because they are so bogged down micro-managing every employee. There is a lot of talk and hype at the company, but it’s all ceremony, there is no substance.

This makes for a rather annoying work environment if you’re serious about getting things done, but it is a good environment to learn in. As long as you can build a convincing enough house of cards in the end, they will throw you a party. It gets annoying eventually, and is probably the reason why their best employees keep quitting, but it can actually be quite liberating working in an environment where there are no real consequences for experimenting and making mistakes, which is why I list it as a pro.","One of the founders is dead weight and the other is mediocre but thinks he’s the next Elon Musk because he reads pop science and studied stats on coursera. It’s sad to see someone with decent potential be so crippled by their own ego.

The biggest flaw is the business model itself, though. The company operates illegally in many of the cities it’s in and where units are operating legally the company struggles to improve because of their inability to respond to feedback. If you try to say something negative about the company to management, they will tell you to your face that it’s “BS” or that you’re “just wrong, you don’t understand”. Negative guest reviews are dismissed as outliers until the problems compound and begin to affect revenue a few months down the road. The company is always reacting to problems, never pre-empting them. They cannot grow to any major scale because as soon as they become big enough they will be completely overwhelmed by legal and PR issues.

This incapacity for self reflection is why the company is stalling. It will cripple them completely unless they fundamentally change the culture. The upper management is now so populated with yes-men who are there not for their competence but because they lie to the founders to make them feel good that it will take a near total restructuring to do that, though.

There are also very few women in the company. The few women who have been there for a long time get passed over for promotion in favour of people with less experience and education but who are more like the founders. Women they hire into senior roles quit after a few months for reasons that are totally obvious to some yet somehow a complete mystery to the founders. It’s a very toxic culture, but they’re proud of it so it won’t change. They pay lip service to the notion of diversity by publicly announcing people’s sexual orientation when they join the company and by holding “culture committee” meetings, but nothing comes of these and nothing changes because they fundamentally don’t want to change the root cause of it all, their frat-house culture.

This leads to high turnover and a perpetual hiring cycle. New people self-select out of the company and then the founders tell you they just didn’t have what it takes. There are always more new people than old so most of the effort of veteran employees goes toward training rather than getting things done.

Sonder will always be limited by its lack of a real underlying business model and broken culture. So, you should go to Sonder to learn as much as you can in a short time then leverage your experience to join a company where you can have a real future.","Keep hiring the best and brightest. Churn is expensive, but there’s something in the Kool-Aid you serve that keeps the pipeline full no matter how many of your executives quit.

Advice to staff: Don’t work here for more than 1-2 years. That’s all you need to gain some really valuable experience and launch into another opportunity where your time will be appreciated, you will be compensated for your work, and where you will also work with amazing top performers. Sonder will use you. Don’t be afraid to use them, too.

It feels at times like an unofficial C-suite of 20-somethings who can do no wrong because they've been here ""since the good old days.""

Lack of Women -- By my last count, there are approximately 20 women in the company, and 16 of them work in Customer Service at just above minimum wage roles. In the past 3 months, we have lost all but one of the senior female staff. There isn't (to my knowledge) a predatory environment here, but there is a definite lack of support and care for Sonder's existing female employees or potential new hires. Every time this gets brought up, it is meant with ""yes, that's a problem,"" but we have continued to lose female staff with no action being done.

Lack of Diversity -- There are very few people of color in salaried roles/at HQ. Almost every person of color employed by Sonder is earning just above minimum wage doing maintenance work. This could be remedied by a functioning HR department, which we somehow do not have after 3 years of incorporation. Because of the referral system, we only end up getting referrals from the existing (mostly white, male, wealthy) professional network.

Inappropriate goals from CEO and COO -- We aren't uber. Stop acting like it. We cannot realistically expand at such a rapid pace without perfecting our operations and product first.

Arrogant COO -- COO has no operations experience and routinely sets ludicrous goals for the teams that report (indirectly) to him. We get lectured routinely about how we should be more like XYZ cool SAAS company...We house people. We aren't a software company, and we need to stop pretending we are.

No HR department -- This company is three years old and doesn't have a functioning HR department. That speaks for itself and results in a lot of people being fired, very fast, with no recourse and no appropriate guiding of the situation.

Tricky legal environment -- Many of the cities Sonder operates in have by-laws that make it very difficult to operate legally. This means that despite having incredible talent in the City Teams, many people have been let go simply because it's near impossible to meet their OKRs due to laws out of their control.

Health Plan -- why, why, why are Orthopedic shoes covered by our health plan, but not mental health clinical visits?

Inappropriate budgeting -- Hourly employees do not have our own computers and need to get to work early if they want to use one for the day. And yet, we can afford to fly all salaried employees in every quarter, spend a ludicrous amount on Alcohol and Soylent (apparently, the fuel of startups), etc.

We were asked to write these reviews to attract more people, since we don't have a real HR department. You'll notice the timeline and the amount of planted reviews. Nice one.

Another huge concern is that there is serious gender bias and inequality, which is unfortunate in a relatively small startup. All high-ranking jobs are held by white men. Rather than trying to build a great company with fantastic employees, encouraging people to work hard while still enjoying themselves, they’ve created an environment where people are afraid and strain themselves with no reward or recognition.
All in all, terrible management, no guidance or feedback, and communication is not encouraged.
Most people perform very very well, yet receive no rewards or bonuses. Don’t expect to be noticed here if you’re not a white male — you’ll forever be disregarded.
