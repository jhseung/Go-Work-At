Good pay and stock options, but not very clear on when stocks are granted.","Promotion frequency for engineering vs management tracks seems far too slanted towards the management side
Merit pay increases seem to be below industry average
Asurion is a very fast paced environment at times which is not for everyone, and can be difficult to get a good work/life balance. However a good balance is achievable and carries a lot of weight as to why I’ve stayed with the company over the years. That balance took me some years to figure out, and I’m ok with working at odd hours and spending time working on weekends when needed. A lot of stressful years were put in before I reached a balance so I need state that for clarification. Also my first few years with the company the growth rate was really straining the employees. Employees are far less strained overall these days, but the pressure and flux can be overwhelming for some.","Improve merit pay increases. Bonuses are generally very good, but merit pay has been has been questionable over my time with the company. When management changes for a developer or engineer then any progress towards a promotion resets which can result in a bit of a recurring cycle. I’ve seen this scenario occur with a good number of coworkers, and with merit pay increases not having a lot of momentum. I’ve seen employees leave over this problem because they get to point where they can get a much better salary elsewhere.

I was also under the impression I would be providing client-facing support for ATT employees, not customer-facing support for ATT customers. I did not find the training to be effective. I felt it was rushed with a lack of practice before taking live calls. You should include an entire week for test calls that simulate a real day in production. that is taking multiple test calls a day for 5 days, not just 4 test calls. The micro management of attendance is ridiculous. I am a 40-year-old man and know how important it is to be on time and to complete work in a timely fashion. PTO and no paid vacation time were also a turn off. I am also a full-time college student and I think shift bids are inappropriate for my situation. My position at Asurion was not in line with my career and college goals.","Overall the fact that attendance is the number reason for high turnover shows that your system is flawed, I understand that Asurion needs to meet the SLA's of their Clients, but you are wasting millions of dollars every year on training people that won’t stay with the company due to poor work life balance. A class of 20 trainees at 17.25 cost you $13,800 a week, $82,000 for six weeks. Now let’s say you have ten training classes running consecutively for 6 weeks across the country that is $828,000 every six weeks in training. there is 8.6, 6 week cycles in a calendar year. So if you had 10 training classes every 6 weeks with 20 trainees your company is spending $7,120,800 dollars a year of training alone, If turnover is say 50% due to attendance your wasting $3,560,400 dollars in training each year, and how much money was then wasted on a short term employees who makes it through training to production only to quit later because of poor work/life balance and micromanagement? Offering great benefits and pay is not enough incentive to keep long term employees, and to be honest I think you know you can provide these benefits such as 4 tiers of health plans from 3 major insurance providers because no one stays long enough to use them.",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0

No micromanagement - you're given the freedom to make your own success.

You get to work with some really smart people.

I've never worked for a company that put so much focus on employee satisfaction.

Company is run by some very smart people. They created an industry out of nothing and grow substantially each year.

The company is generous at granting requests for any resources you need to do your job, including expensive tools, are long as theres a solid justification.","The company has grown so much, so quickly that there are some growing pains and administrative disfunction.

Work is very fast paced and you have to be able to change directions quickly.

Lots of technical decisions are made only with the short-term in mind and it creates technical debt to be paid in the future.

Lots of workplace politics and tribal knowledge. You have to learn to navigate this to be successful. This comes from being a small company many years ago and is changing.

Work/life balance is good in general if you set boundaries and get the work done. But, if there's an outage that affects the business, you won't sleep until over. The sense of urgency is higher here because of the financial impact.","Balance the long-term against the short-term so we're not accruing additional technical debt on every project.

Create standards for project management so there's a clear expectation on how things should go with each PM on EVERY project. When you change a process, make sure it's actually communicated to people.

Engage with technical resources when establishing new processes (purchasing, project management,etc) so we can create processes that are actually feasible. As it stands, new processes are being created that aren't realistic and people just work around them.",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

If an employee does not have the right life balance, hence the employee will be more focused on work but not the family which eventually makes him/her unhappy in the long run. As a result, his/her quality of work will be degrading. Asurion makes sure this life balance by flexible office time. I found the working environment is like academia like flexible research ability and cooperation and share knowledge which is essential for any company's growth.

2019-03-07, Principal Engineer,"Nashville, TN",Former Employee ,Keep your parachute packed -- save your money for unemployment!,More than a year,0,"They pay well, generally more than other employers in Nashville.","Save some of that money and be prepared to be laid off at any time. I was there for over 2 years, which included three Decembers. Two of those three there were major RIFs, layoffs, mass firings -- whatever you want to call it. December 2018 they got rid of 70 people in IT. They'll be hiring like crazy this spring. Every year, they churn a lot of people.

The environment is wide open. If you like noise and bustle, it is perfect. If you ever want to concentrate as part of your job, you are in trouble. Get some great noise-blocking headphones and figure out a way to shield your vision, because the noise and movement from every direction with no walls or partitions in the worst implementation of the flawed open office concept I have ever experienced. Right before I was RIFed there was a guy in the ""pod"" right next to me -- our elbows were literally less than 12 inches apart.

They have an embarrassment of riches, mainly because cell phone insurance and extended warranties are a complete ripoff. Other than the moral baggage of working for such a company, know that all that money means lots of projects being spun up on a whim. There seems to be no process to avoid duplication of effort, or starting something from scratch with a new team rather than fixing an existing product with lessons learned from the existing team Very wasteful, but they recover money by laying people off every year.

They have a reputation in Nashville, and it isn't a good one. Several recruiters told me Asurion is known for spitting people out. Another major employer in town refuses to hire anyone who has worked at Asurion. They do not want their culture infected by anyone who has been part of the Asurion way.","Walls and partitions are not a bad thing. People need to focus sometimes, so provide an environment where they can do so. Introverts don't need to collaborate constantly, and are annoyed when people are standing around them ""collaborating"" all day. Introverts are a major part of IT, so stop torturing them. The only people who like open environments are facilities managers. Do some research.

Hiring young, inexperienced people and getting rid of the expensive, experienced ones may seem like a good idea for the bottom line. It isn't -- intuition and experience should be valued and retained. Stop churning out your best people.

Perhaps get rid of the annual bonus and put that money into regular salaries. People are far too focused on meeting numbers to get a big bonus -- I think this drives the annual fall spending freezes and Black December layoffs.

Be more transparent about your product, so employees aren't afraid to admit where they work. Many of your customers are shocked to find out they are getting a refurbished phone and paying a deductible which could easily buy an equivalent phone on Amazon or eBay. Add in the premiums and it is obvious to anyone who has made a claim just what a ripoff your services are. Unless, of course, they are stupid.

There are good people who work there, but too many incompetent managers with no leadership skills.","Ok so here is the deal. I feel terrible for anyone working on the front line. That's right, Our ""technicians/agents"" are treated unfairly. Now, there are some technicians that don't care about their job, but there is no accountability for them but to be fair the role sucks, extremely long hours, terrible work-life balance, holiday /birthday kids event will be missed. So I understand why some people check the hell out. Now there are OUTSTANDING, WELL EDUCATED, & LOYAL EMPLOYEES' on the front-line, That are completely overlooked because they don't have the ""right look"" yes the ""Right Look"". I heard that said, what does that really mean??

The word that comes to mind is NEPITISM or CULTURAL BAIS or Racism. Regardless, terrible managers and leaders are allowed to stay in their role without question regardless of how many complaints they receive. -No accountability

 The company wants to retain most employees and overlooks obvious HR issues, management issues, and stressful work-life balance for their employees, in operations.

NOW-READ THIS--- roughly 90% of the front-line/entre level/operation..basically the grunt work, is a minority; Black, Latino, Asian, a super mixture of people. Meanwhile, at the(HQ) Head-Quarters location, these are all Administrative jobs and career paths are it a polarizing opposite,-90% White.

Now if you are NOT picking up what I am putting down, that is. An administrative job is wayyy easier, great work-life balance, weekend off, more opportunities, MUCH higher pay, corporate office parties (they're LIT) ..etc

Now I know, your saying well I should just apply to the administrative jobs. SURE. However, if you don't have the ""Right Look"" you will be discredited in some fashion while your white counterpart will be selected. I watched it happen over and over. Now here is the kicker....

I am WHITE, I just dont like unfair BS

2018-10-02, Premier Support Technician,"Las Vegas, NV",Former Employee ,Great job - not very forgiving though....,Less than a year,0,Was a great job while it lasted. The training period is adequate for the position and the job overall is pretty easy - just take calls and take care of the customer. Management is easily approachable and the degree of transparency is top-notch.,"Not very forgiving when it comes to policy (this is actually a pro and a con, see advice to management). Mistakes made while training can and will be grounds for termination. Not eligible for rehire, even if you give two-weeks notice (this is per upper management when I asked if I was eligible for rehire).","Policies are put in place to protect the company and the clients that the company works for... this is easy to grasp and understand. However, I would highly recommend taking a look at the companies stance regarding mistakes made during training. Training is a period to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes... which means giving people time to implement corrective action so as to avoid making the same mistake again in the future. I was literally put on a written/final for making a mistake (which I fully own) and then a call was audited the same day I was put on that written/final where I had made the same mistake again (which I again fully own). While I had taken the appropriate actions to ensure I did not make the same mistake again after being put on corrective action, (which is verifiable via the companies internal quality audits), this was still viewed as violating that corrective action and I was let go two days after completing training.

I don't hold the management responsible here, as I need to (and completely do) own my mistakes... but the call audited was literally the same day as my corrective action. I don't know the time stamp of the call, but I'm positive it was time-stamped before I was put on corrective action (since every call can be verified to see that I implemented changes to avoid making the same mistake) and that should have been taken into consideration by management when deciding to pursue termination for breaking the written/final I was put on.

So my advice to management is to view the training period as just that: a training period. Allow people the time to learn from their mistakes. If an employee makes a mistake and is put on a written/final, give that employee a chance to show that they can implement the necessary changes. Would save the company a lot of time and resources in training people.

NOTE: This in no way, shape, or form is me claiming I was let go unfairly. I understand and get policies and management has been transparent from beginning to end. This is just some friendly advice is all. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make Asurion my home and I am sorry things didn't work out.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

•Monthly incentive bonuses if metrics are exceeded, annual raise reviews (when your leaders remember to actually schedule time for your reviews).

•Occasional themed days and snacks for employees.","•Shift bids every 6 months based on metrics (no seniority), leadership only focused on metrics and “delivering premier service” when they themselves are inexperienced and very few actually tech savvy.

•Operations Managers rotate frequently, changing clients and departments.

•In the course of two years, you could be working on up to 10 different teams/leaders/schedules.

•NO SICK DAYS - any unexcused time counts against your metrics and eliminates/lowers your chance of a bonus or good schedule ranking.

•Miscommunication between “supervisors” and policies, forcing department changes and unexpected audits (that they are unprepared for) from external clients and unnecessary stress to employees.

•Good company to start at when working at a new site, but quickly fell a part with high turnover.

•Incentive based bonus structure readjusted or changed to hurt employees and favor company randomly, as it is constantly being re-evaluated.

•Almost every manager or leader is guilty of poor grammar and spelling in written communications, but expect perfection when speaking with customers/clients.

•Very high call volume and at times, mandatory overtime or “leadership” pressuring employees to sign up for additional hours outside of their regular working hours.

•When working in a role that is fluent for both voice and chats, priority appears to be given to those technicians to chat with poor surveys, or individual favorites within the department (no fair rotation to maintain proficiency).

•Troubleshooting is not trained, nor education on specific devices, but the roles are expected to know “how to look for information”. Many times, online simulators are inefficient, knowledge articles are not updated, or search results can be blocked (depending on client) for certain hardware and software scopes.

•Metrics are unrealistic when troubleshooting over the phone with customers of different technological backgrounds and wide scopes of equipment/devices.","•Investigate supervisors and Operations Managers accused of sexual misconduct, as well as be more transparent with employees and changes.

•Invest in a yearly allotment of sick time to be used, so as to not hurt employee’s chances of advancement when the unexpected happens.

•Do not hire or promote employees as “coaches” without a technical assessment (when that is expected of employees), as well as their ability to be empathetic, and actual role models as leaders within their own teams.

•Metrics are very unrealistic and the focus should be on delivering a “premier experience” no matter the time cost to the company or negative impact on a technician’s total call resolution time or random surveys.",1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

They want you to sell upgrades with no commission. Overtime is hard to come by unless it's odd hours like 4 am and it's barely nothing. Move your schedule doesn't work half the time either the app is slow, it shut down, or they have too much staff because your days off are obviously over staffed but that's the only option to move to. You have way to many apps to open and litterally even the help desk tells you they have to large a system for the network they pay for so half the systems don't run sometimes. You are in a claims department but you don't make bonus if you make claims or ie: your resolution is low. No support. You ask a question your sups litterally don't know and won't try and help you find out. Only 1 person in aq ever even helps everyone else is eager to get you off the phone and doesn't help you they way they can. You have to apply for promotion so if your a person who likes promotional recognition this isn't for you.

Also they do a lot fun activities for their employees every month.,This company takes better care of their new employees better than there current employees. Brand new employees start at for example 16.50 when people before them started the pay was 15.50. The base pay goes up and thats why the new people start at 16.50. Also all current employees get that plus whatever raises they had acquired unless you are on a corrective action. Then you don't get a raise. So if you started at 15.50 and didn't receive a bonus and got put on a corrective action then you stayed at 15.50 when the new reps who haven't done anything start at 16.50 that make makes tenured reps upset.,My advice to management would be make sure your tenured employees are taken care before you take care the employees.

2018-03-27, Technical Consultant,"Fort Myers, FL",Current Employee ,"Nice company, unless you're in a rural area.",More than a year,0,"Competitive pay/benefits for the field. Work is fairly easy to keep up with, only a finite number of things can go wrong in a phone.

Company takes care of its employees in the event of crisis or serious need for help. I genuinely do feel they care as a company(they checked up on me multiple times during the hurricanes, constantly offering help). Constant fundraisers for various reasons to help out other employees with medical bills, funeral expenses, etc.

Incentive plan looks juicy, although due to other problems, you will never get it in full.","Living in a rural area essentially results in career stagnation. You're essentially stuck as bottom rung until someone is fired or quits, then someone gets promoted not on merit, but necessity. The end result is you have talent at the bottom rung, with supervisors picked for you based on little more than seniority, which is a fast track to incompetence, since it's a hard position to fill in rural areas(they wouldn't get fired for incompetence, they'll be put up with). Additionally, raises are very, very slow, with an average of about 20 cents an hour a year.

Incentive pay is a whole other thing, where none of it based on individual performance, but rather performance as a store and as a district. This results in hardworking people losing their bonus pay for performing super well to some store a couple hours away, and there's nothing they can do about it(this can end up making you lose out on like $300/month). Additionally, they tend to up the requirements every time a district gets close to reaching peak pay out, which is demoralizing. What's the point in continuing to go the extra mile if you're going to keep asking for a bit more each time?

Management switches out fairly often, and they often hire from outside markets, meaning they don't have a grasp of how the operation is run. What this results in is the subordinates having to teach the management how to run stores. We shouldn't be training them. They should be promoted from within, or trained extensively. It is not our job to make sure our bosses know how to manage us.

No control over your inventory, which can result in a ton of escalations with customers. ""What kind of repair center has no parts?""","Train your managers. Promote from within. Promoting from within gives everyone else in the company room to grow. TC to LTC, LTC to Manager, Manager to Senior Manager, and so on.

Instead of giving us a million discounts that we can't use/benefits that aren't applicable to most people, funnel that money into wage raises for your employees that have been there. Invest in us, and we'll be more keen to invest in you. We are your front line, take care of us.

Promote based on merit. Enough with this seniority nonsense. I know of three different stores in my region that each have TCs that are overqualified for their position(myself included), meanwhile their LTCs have no manners with customers, or even with their co-workers Sprint side. I've met two LTCs in my district alone that genuinely do not know how to repair phones. As a result, you lose a lot of TCs in that store, because they have no one to teach them, so you assume they're not fit for the job. This makes everyone short-staffed, having your people become overwhelmed with work for no extra benefit. Major morale killer.

Make at least SOME part of the incentive plan based on the individual. It is awfully discouraging to put all your effort into a truly wonderful customer experience, keeping exchange rates low, getting registrations, etc., to have no payout because someone three cities away could give a rat's behind.

Honestly, I could go on for ages. The company is great, but their management and presentation leave a lot to be desired.",3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

2018-03-30, Online Chat Representative,,Former Employee ,Only for those with the thickest skin.,More than 5 years,0,Decent pay; the option to work from home; paid time off,Very high-stress; nonstop barrages of angry customers; inconsistent management; low hiring standards; poor communication between departments,"When I first joined the Online Chat department, I was very happy and greatly enjoyed being a part of that team. However, as the department grew I felt that upper management tried to do too much too quickly with it. Chat agents are expected to handle three customers at a time. During my time with the department, the process of assisting a customer with their claim via chat grew more and more complicated, to the point where it had the same number of steps as required by the call center agents. And yet, we were still expected to handle three chats at a time. Having to juggle three simultaneous customers, assisting each one to the same level as a call center rep would, is simply too much to ask of a single human being. After arguing this point with management for over two years to no avail, I finally parted ways with the company.

I urge management to reconsider the practice of having these agents do triple the work of a call center agent. Reducing the concurrency from 3 chats to 2 would be far more manageable, and would allow your agents to better assist your customers. Wouldn't you rather service customers better and more quickly, than service a few more customers poorly and more slowly?

My overall impression of this company is that they value numbers over the comfort and welfare of their employees. The call center and ASG employees have the most difficult job in the entire company, because they're the ones dealing with angry customers all day. Maybe if these employees were happier, the customers would in turn become a little less angry, and more likely to leave a 5 on their survey.",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

A lot of employees lack the job skills to work here after training and leave poor notes that leave you confused at what happened previously with a now upset customer. Coaches for the most part are not supportive and only care about themselves. Only a few good apples (talking about you Charles, Tray, and Courtney) in the bunch and they're overworked and underpaid. Promotions are based on kissing butt, not who's qualified. If you have issues, get sick, or have family problems you're out of luck.

Yes the management records all conversations when they meet with employees 95% of the time whenever the upper management calls the employee into their office onto a laptop.

Upper management needs to provide proof of any customer voice interactions of the employee and customer who the upper management is accusing of any inaccurate procedures or prohibited Asurion company procedures conducted by the employee.

Let the employee hear the recorded conversation instead the management saying or stating what they heard with their own ears. Remember the employee get a lot of long or stressful calls at times.

The facilities are new, modern, and clean -- three qualities missing from every other call center in Las Vegas. Most of the people are friendly. You'll learn a lot about tech, and your family will be asking you how to fix their phones.","The location is terrible. It's way out of the way for many of the techs.
Management is out of touch with the techs, and any outside reality. There are managers who don't have any idea, for example, that the best talent in Las Vegas goes to The Strip for jobs.
Management lives in a bubble of spreadsheets and metrics of dubious quality and accuracy.
This is an insurance company (after market extended warranties, actually) trying to do tech. The result is people in the VP and C suite in Nashville are completely clueless about how tech works or what customers need.
They work with a third party for things like ADA compliance and any sort of medical issue which requires leave of absence. That third party has no understanding of basic HIPAA policies and disregards various legal and ethical guidelines in medicine.
You'll be told that internal promotions are what they're all about. But when push comes to shove, external managers are hired while those promoted are sat back down.
Upper management is led by people with no connection with reality.
In other words, this is a corporate call center led by shallow people who never read books or could make it in another field.
This is a call center. It's a shallow industry led by shallow people.","Repeat after me: This. Is. Just. A. Call. Center.
This is not an ER.
What we do isn't a matter of life or death.
Keep it simple.
The coaching model being used is a joke. Nobody takes it seriously because it puts all the power in the hands of the wrong people. If there are problems, it starts at the top, so don't take it out on the managers if the entire company is experiencing the same problems.
This is Las Vegas. The top industry is hospitality, not call centers. If you want the best talent, get out there and find out what the top call centers are doing in terms of employee recruitment, on-boarding, training, and engagement. When the top call center in town drops half a million on a holiday party and all Asurion gets are stale cookies and supermarket doughnuts, there's a total misunderstanding of what it takes to succeed in this town.
On that note, this is a service oriented job. Go find hospitality gurus who can come in and help train the techs in how to deliver the best service under the sun.
Your location is bad. Has anyone considered offering some sort of shuttle service to ensure employees get to work on time? Many techs have to use the poor Las Vegas public transportation.
Learn what HIPAA is and what doctors can and can not divulge. If HR gets ahold of an employee's medical records through the third party, it's a violation of federal laws. Fines and prison sentences for violators are the prizes for that violation.
Let newly promoted coaches learn. Don't throw them under the bus. Have legitimate training for them so they understand concepts like zero defects, how to manage reporting, collaboration, negotiation, and then give them the tools and support to their jobs successfully.
Want retention? Recruit at the colleges! Then take a hard look at your on-boarding, training, and engagement practices.
Plan and develop programs before rolling them out.
Streamline reporting. Get it right so techs and coaches aren't always trying to figure out what's accurate and what's not.
Hire more college educated supervisors and managers. This should be a given. But too often having a conversation with someone who doesn't understand the difference between empathy and compassion is like knocking down a wall with a spoon. They're not the same thing.
Read more. P.L.E.A.S.E. Read more. Read serious novels. Read serious literature. Read history. Read serious books about management.

2017-10-12, Employee,"San Mateo, CA",Former Employee ,California R&D Office is a Joke,More than a year,0,"- A free Caltrain shuttle stops at the door of the building
- Sweet view of the bay
- If you’re on the right team, you’ll work on the in-thing in tech","The title of this review is not hyperbole — employees at the headquarters in Tennessee dismiss the teams in the California office as a joke. I’ll tell you why from a people perspective...

The attitude, demeanor and knowledge level of the staff at the California office is cringeworthy. I’ll give you three examples to prove this.

Firstly, there are individuals in the organization holding lead developer roles who do not know how to use git and are resistant to using pull requests and code reviewes — it’s 2017, get with the idea of collaboration. Google is your friend, research best practices for collaborative work — pull requests and git are must haves in 2017.

There are other lead developers who are primadonnas who will throw a hissy fit if they don’t get their way — you’re a lead, act like a lead by your words and actions instead of using your “title” to prove you’re a lead.

Thirdly, the attitude problem goes beyond frontline employees —managers will second guess your decisions at every opportunity, even if they were involved in the decision making process with you and you both agreed on the decision together. If you are a leader, have the intelligence to think through a decision, have the conviction to make the decision, and have the steadiness not to waffle on the decision later and most of all, don’t constantly second-guess yourself or your team — you are managers, act like it!

On top of that, the managers that they’ve tended to hire at the California office don’t exude poise: they speak without confidence or conviction. And if you get past speaking ability, content-wise management don’t demonstrate the vision or foresight to plan more than 2 sprints ahead — many teams don’t even have a well-defined quarterly roadmap with milestones.

All of these problems can be traced however to a candidate vetting process that is suspect at best. There have been candidates that were brought in, who, when interviewed, had little to no match with the qualifications listed on the job posting; these candidates shouldn’t have made it past a phone screen and instead they made it to the in-person round when we actually flew them into town for the interview!","You are based in Silicon Valley — the mecca of tech; there is no reason that you should be staffing an R&D office with mediocrity. The concepts and ideas come out of this office have the potential to be good, but the ability to execute, the level of professionalism and the vision of your teams are stifling potential .

Clean up shop at the California office by doing the following:

1) Trim the fat by getting rid of weak managers who cannot lead with confidence and vision

2) Don’t reward mediocrity — there is no way developers in 2017 should be a working at a lead or senior level if they don’t even know how to use git or don’t know how to create a pull request. And don’t let people get away with acting like primadonnas in the workplace.

3) Only insist on hiring people who can demonstrate that they meet the hiring criteria for a role — at the very minimum! If you aren’t going to filter candidates based on qualifications what’s the point of a creating a job description?",1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
