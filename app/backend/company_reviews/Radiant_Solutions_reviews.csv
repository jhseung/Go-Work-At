It was a very close group which made it particularly hard to leave. In addition, my manager and director were always extremely supportive of career growth which was very important to me and I appreciate everything they did for me. As an operational meteorologist, I learned an immense amount from the more experienced meteorologists. It was a supportive group which I believe allowed us all to succeed and I know that they will continue to succeed.

Outside of my direct group, I was an avid supporter of the Snack Wednesdays, the company holiday parties, the chili cookoff, along with other events. Dogfish Alehouse is across the street from the Gaithersburg office too which always makes for a good meeting spot.","This is more to do with the requirement of my role but the non-standard hours were difficult along with working holidays and weekends at times. This comes with the job though. I also felt that the upper level management was disconnected at times from our group. There also tended to be some communication issues from upper level management at times, but this improved a lot from when I first started to when I was leaving.",Continue to allow people to grow.

We still maintain that ""smaller company"" feel even though we have grown so much in the last several years. It is important to empower mid-level managers to help the people under them and make sure the right people are chosen for such positions. Just because someone has been a great analyst or programmer for years doesn't mean they will be a good manager. It is also important to train and give resources to the managers who want to improve and get better for the sake of their team and the company. For the most part, I believe this is happening and it benefits everyone in the long run. It is easy to let a job fall into just punching a time clock and showing up (especially after several years), but I don't believe in that and I don't think that is what we do in this company, in my experience.
