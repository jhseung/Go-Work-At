2019-02-04, Senior Consultant,,Current Employee ,Fantastic company to work for,Fantastic company to work for,0,"I have never worked at a company before who cares more about their staff welfare. Every time I have needed help, or someone else needs help, the management team jump into action. From HR to the CEO, everyone is willing to help, and will do whatever they can to make things better for you.

The C-level management team are very accessible to everyone. They have grown quickly, and are all busy, but never too busy to listen to you or have a chat. It is lovely to have such a down to earth management team, who do not have a trace of arrogance, and make an effort to listen to your input and ideas, then thank you for them! I personally, have had many a meeting with the CEO, who has asked my opinion, listened to it, and made decisions based on it. How refreshing is that!?

I love the diversity within the company. As a woman in tech, the workplace can sometimes be a lonely place, but here at Adaptive there is a broad spectrum of people from all walks of life, and this makes for a fabulous and diverse workplace.

People here are seriously smart. Seriously. It is such a luxury to work with a bunch of superheroes who need little to no management oversight, get on with the job, and do a fantastic one at that.

People here are also very friendly, and work together as a team, with a huge amount of mutual respect. There are plenty of social things that happen as well.

It's a great office in London, with fab views out over the city.","As Adaptive are a growing company, they are evolving in their management structure to adapt to the growth and size. Sometimes they don't get this perfectly right, but on the plus side they recognise this and are constantly taking steps to change things and make things better all the time.

For the same reason, Line Management is somewhat 'light' at Adaptive. Some people prefer this of course, whereas some perhaps more junior members of the team may feel a little lost. Again, it is something they are aware on and working on, which is very refreshing.",Keep doing what you are doing!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2019-02-03, Back End Developer,Barcelona (Spain),Current Employee ,A dynamic tech company,A dynamic tech company,0,"I've enjoyed working for Adaptive Consulting for now more than one year. No hierarchy (no ""boss""). The collaborators are let free to organise their work as it best suits them. I've worked on a project using trending technologies and very challenging, having the opportunity to work with great people (some of them located in the London office) and learning a lot.
Moreover, the company is growing and in constant evolution with more clients and more and more projects.
A very nice atmosphere where respect is always present. I sometimes travel to the London office, and the feeling there is also very good.
I highly recommend.",I really can't think of any...,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-07-06, ,"London, England (UK)",Current Employee ,Take it from me - these guys are the real deal.,Take it from me - these guys are the real deal.,0,"I came on board at Adaptive on a fairly large and challenging project. Now, I've been around in financial services for a long time, and I know how most companies in the sector operate; I fully expected to be left high and dry, desperately trying to deliver an ill-thought through project while being whipped through constant 14 hour days, and seven day weeks.

Consequently, I was stunned when it become clear that that the absolute opposite was true. In fact, the directors had my back throughout. When I needed support, they were there, and did their absolute best to do whatever they could to help. They set the strongest possible example, always thinking of their employees first - and by the way, such strong examples are what really sets a company's culture. At all times, I was empowered, supported, and (maybe most importantly) trusted. Here, delegation is of both authority and responsibility; I have seldom seen environments that are both so respectful, and so empowering. I can't stress enough that the ethos and culture of this company is genuinely something unusual in the sector, and I count myself extremely fortunate to have ended up here.

Career opportunities? They are definitely there, if you want them. The company is growing quickly, and if you want responsibility, you can step up, and it's yours for the taking. On the other hand, if you want to just come in, do a great job, and preserve your work / life balance - that's OK too. Meanwhile pay is high, and benefits are strong.

I honestly can't recommend Adaptive enough - I'd certainly refer the best and brightest people I've ever worked with here, and I can't think of a better endorsement than that. I feel privileged to be here, and hope it will continue for a long time into the future.","Frankly, not much.

They are a small team but each member has been carefully selected. Passionate, experienced, highly intelligent and team focused. You find yourself constantly challenged and growing .

The 2nd reason I love working here is the mix of working in the London Finance arena, but not being shackled by big company red-tape. We work on important projects for big clients, but we get the benefits of being in a small company. We work hard on researching latest tech and ways we can stay ahead of the technology curve, we have great work stations at the office, and we get the flexibility of working for a smaller company.

Working with great people means you meet more great people. Meeting more great people help you grow even faster. It is a virtuous cycle.","We are a consultancy, so often the best we can do is to consult. This means sometimes the client wont follow our guidance.
