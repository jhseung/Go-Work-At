2019-03-03, Purchasing Manager,,Former Employee ,"Work Hard, Learn a Ton. Never a Boring Day.","Work Hard, Learn a Ton. Never a Boring Day.",0,"My work was varied, interesting and challenging. Offices were well kept and thoughtfully put together (which makes a difference when you're working somewhere for long hours). Boss is super knowledgeable and experienced, someone I learned a lot from in my years at the company. I went on to find success in my succeeding jobs due largely in part to what I learned here.","Some seriously insane coworkers at this company over the years. People who hid drug issues, came in late constantly, picked fights with management, stole company property. You name it. I suspect it's was/is a symptom of the local DC job market.

The CEO is an opinionated leader with a track record to back up his point of view. That can be challenging to navigate at times but when dealing with competent and hard working staff he was always very reasonable and open to input.",,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

2016-10-26,,"Alexandria, VA",Former Employee ,Stay away for your sanity,Stay away for your sanity,0,Nice looking office. Most of the staff is helpful and understanding of the workplace situation. No need for overtime (could be perceived as negative).,Lack of middle management means that the employees have to answer directly to the CEO. CEO is pretty clearly a raging narcissist who is incapable of clear communication with staff; is verbally abusive toward employees when miscommunication arises.,"Hire a middle management staff as a buffer between yourself and your techs. Negative reinforcement is detrimental to company morale. Do not expect junior technicians fresh out of school to be ready to do management's job-- if you need someone to do management, then don't post a junior technician job.",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
2016-07-29, Administrative Assistant,"Alexandria, VA",Former Employee ,Horrible experience.,Horrible experience.,0,None. There are none. None.,"The owner of this company is verbally abusive, manipulative, and cruel. I lasted for less than a week and started to experience chest pains. He was charming and nice during the interview, and then the first day was less nice. The second day, he started to berate me and I had to spend hours listening to him talk about things that made no sense. He started to make offensive comments. I overheard him mocking a co-worker's accent. He asked me why I looked so scared and if ""I had ever been beaten."" And many other really inappropriate comments. Horrible, horrible, nightmarish experience. He seems insane. I reached out to a former admin. asst. who told me the same thing happened to her, but she was able to stick it out for almost a year. She said she didn't know how she did it.",Get help. Now.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0
