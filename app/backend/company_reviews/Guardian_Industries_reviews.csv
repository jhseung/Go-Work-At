When I started, it seemed great! Good pay, good benefits, and a sense of worth. They paid a good relocation package for me to move across country to work for them. However, it did not last long. What initially attracted me to them was they seemed to be entrepreneurial minded, however, I learned you need to be very careful when taking chances. They are not as entrepreneurial friendly to their employees as it appears. If a mistake is made, they are very unforgiving and your job in on the line. If it is successful, your manager takes the credit.","These guys manage with a sense of fear, every day I went to work I felt like I was walking on thin ice. I would just think to myself. I just have to make it 13 hours. There is a strong good ol boys club and if your not part of it, watch out! They fired people left and right. Especially the hourly workers.

Shortly after college I was offered a job with Guardian as a shift supervisor. I gave my heart of soul to this place, picked up my young family and moved across the country for guardian. It ended up being the worst career move I ever made. I'm not a slouch either. I am a smart, hard working and reliable employee. . I have never been let go from a job, ever! Until Guardian. There is a reason you see the position of shift supervisor open so frequently on their website. They fire most of them, or they quit because of the stress and pressure put on them. If something bad happens, it is your fault, whether you had anything to do with it or not. Turnover is horrendous!

If you are offered a shift supervisor job with them, think long and hard about taking it because chances are, you won't make it a year with them. Of the 5 salary employees that started with me, only one was there after a year. seriously. I think the hourly employees were turning over about every month or two. The only ones that stayed were there because they needed the money so bad that they stayed until they found something else.","If there is a issue, a good manager helps fix the problem.

    You will work 12 hour shifts and rotate from nights to days every month. In addition, you will be forced to work overtime on your scheduled days off. You are given two ""personal"" days per year which count against you if you use them. You are also given few vacation days that they can reject as they see fit. Basically, forget about your family, and forget about attending any events that must be planned in advance. They are supposed to notify you 24hrs. In advance but that is not always the case.
    This company will destroy your work ethic. Forget about merit and seniority, they mean nothing at this place. Everyone is treated the same, good workers and lazy workers. The more skills you learn, the more management blames you for everything. Everyone gets paid the same no matter what! The only things that don't apply to all equally are the rules. Discipline is decided on a case by case basis (no rule book here). If you are part of the good ol' boys club or one of their kids, you are untouchable. If you are a regular employee and step out of line, you are scum and a horrible person.

The last year has seen sales of parts of the business and whilst this is understandable, it was very poorly communicated; fear and confusion lurk everywhere. Guardian was a little oasis detached from corporate reality for many years, now the changes are coming and I have never worked at a place with such an uneasy and unpleasant vibe compounded by total lack of clarity around what is going to happen. Half of the old timers in management are paralysed with fear that they will be next out the door and the other half is cutting people off at the knees to keep their jobs, or look like they are capable of keeping their jobs.

Because of the change in ownership or strategy there is no ""Guardian Way"" anymore - this is because there is no culture - its a changing beast and once which has yet to grow into its new skin.

- no accountability
- back stabbing
- zero leadership
- very political - if you are not part of the ""good ol' boys club"", don't expect to move up

The only power the managers can exercise is ""veto power"" - ie. the authority to say ""No"" - so everything gets shot down, ex. the great new idea, the great new opportunity - even the great new position

As much as 80% of the salaried workforce (managers included) are miserable because they are in the wrong position for their skill sets/interests - the ""veto power"" in effect

It all boils down to a defective culture. The culture allows complacency, lack of accountability, political back stabbing, and lax leadership to be an accepted standard. Culture impacts all of the employees, and it is the one thing none of us have the ability to change. So what to do instead... ?","Since you work your top performers like dogs, at least pay them accordingly. Or, just a thought - promote them to the positions they've earned!

2013-11-22, Manager,"Floreffe, PA",Former Employee ,Good if used as a stepping stone,Good if used as a stepping stone,0,"The Floreffe facility is very flawed for several different reason but its weaknesses can create great opportunity for some. Their unjustifiable polices on pay increases creates a revolving door of people, which can result in opportunity that wouldn't come at other companies. Guardian has a policy, which they not only admit to but actually brag about, in which they say ""we don't pay the position, we pay the person."" All that this means is that when you get a promotion, you don't get a raise. They will claim that once you prove yourself in the new job, the money will come..... but it never does. As a result qualified people who have moved up, quickly get frustrated for being under paid and leave to go to other companies. This then forces Guardian to promote people who are not as qualified but are willing to be under paid for the opportunity. However, once these people get some experience they become more valuable and are able to get better paying jobs at other companies. Then the cycle repeats.

While this is a terrible strategy for being a successful company, it create opportunity to quickly move up and then get a much better job at another company once you get the experience you wouldn't get at a work place with stability. The lower line supervisor is the best for this if you are starting with little to no experience. The job is absolutely terrible, but the turnover is so high that there are always openings. If you can stick it out for a year it will pretty much be guaranteed that a shift manager position will open up, as these have very high turnover as well. At other manufacturing facilities it can take 10 years or more to get a shift manager spot where as at Floreffe, most have only worked there for 1-3 years. From this point you either see if something higher up opens up, or just get a great manager job at another company making 50% more money. It literally happens 2-3 times a year.

The turnover goes all the way up the ladder too. In the last 3 years there have been 4 Hot end managers, 3 production managers, 4 sales managers, 3 HR managers and 2 plant managers. These are the highest positions in the plant....","Opportunity is only there for managers and supervisors. If you are an hourly employee, run for the hills. It is a terrible work environment and chances are you will only stay there for a couple years. The same goes for engineers. There is very little opportunity for them to move up and they never stay with the company over 2 years. In fact 2 were hired out of Penn St and both quit in under a year.

Make sure you negotiate a good starting salary because you will be stuck at this number until you quit. The job is also dangerous and everything in the plant is old and breaks down. Last year a guy lost his leg, and another got lung damage so bad he will never work again. If you work here, always keep it in the back of your mind that it is just a stepping stone. If you are looking for anything else, you will be disappointed.","I can't say much as I did what they all do.

Essentially, Guardian is forcing their up and coming talent to leave and go to other companies. Also, the shift schedule at the Geneva plant is TERRIBLE.
