They exploit their hard-working members and make them pay for things that legally should be included with employment - you know all those tables that love to steal pens? Well, GAR forces it's serving staff to pay $2 for every 5 pens with THEIR logos on them and you are not allowed to use any other type of pen or you will be 'in trouble' or scorned for not following the GAR standards of service. The teenage hostesses are paid upwards of $16/hr (a portion of which is paid via tip-out of servers who are making less than $3.00/hr), while the extremely hard-working dishwasher who slaves away in the nasty dishroom cleaning up for the entire restaurant, if offered barely over minimum wage. The entire GAR system was built to make sure guests remain happy, despite the inherent flaws in the system that leave hard-workers high and dry but are always reminded to put on a smile. There is so much potential for a team service method in the restaurant industry, and GAR is completely failing at it.","I tried to provide insightful advice to management for years and was turned away or told to 'stop whining' when all I wanted to do was make the work environment better and to try to make the floor stronger. Our sales weren't doing well but management would refuse to try to change their business model. Maybe take a look at why the only servers who stay at your restaurant are the ones who feel too comfortable to try to better their lives, and when people eventually do leave - a huge majority of serving staff have very little nice things to say about their experience.

2016-11-19, Hostess/Server,,Former Employee ,Biggest Bunch of Hypocrites I've Ever Seen,Biggest Bunch of Hypocrites I've Ever Seen,0,"As an hourly employee (food runner, hostess, etc.) the money is decent. The kitchen staff is always wonderful and will look out for you if you don't treat them like trash.","As a hostess: The servers talk about you behind your back constantly, saying how you don't know how to do your job. Extremely sexist management - from the beginning it was apparent that the most important part of being a hostess was smiling and looking pretty. I mean, they refuse to hire male hosts because part of the job description is being eye candy. This is an actual quote from the Managing Partner during a host meeting where he was asking us to put more effort into our appearance: ""I know you all can look good because I interviewed most of you, and I wouldn't have hired you if you didn't."" Another manager told me one day when a girl came in for an interview, ""She's not GAR material"" - just by looking at her.

As a server: Training to be a server was a nightmare. I had already been working for the company, yet I almost quit during server training because it was that bad. The second I finished training, I was taken to the office to fill out my schedule and immediately guilted by the server manager into picking up house shifts for her. This is a problem with management - they constantly try to get you to pick up shifts where you know you won't make money but they REFUSE to work with you when you try and negotiate with them. If you don't help them cover shifts, they treat you like trash. The side work takes waaaaaay too long. On a busy night it can take around two hours just to get out even after you've been cut for a long time. The uniform costs are outrageous and you have to get them heavily starched every shift (a $7 cost every shift). There is clear favoritism when it comes to the floor plan and who gets the best sections. More than once, managers refused to cut me even though the place was empty just because they were mad at me for something. When I was a hostess, the manager who was cutting servers at the end of the night would literally tell me ""If anyone comes up here to see if they're cut, tell me and I will make sure they get cut last.""

In general: There is a strict policy in the company on salaried employees (aka managers) not dating hourlies, and yet this is an issue across the entire company. It is ridiculous how many managers have hooked up with hourly employees. When I was working there, I actually had an issue with a manager who insisted on texting me outside of work and trying to ask me out - this made me extremely uncomfortable since he was my boss. Management is cheap and nickel-and-dimes the guests even though the company is worth millions. I was told once by the GM that ""people have been fired for less"" when I forgot to charge a guest for one cup of coffee - a tactic used often to scare servers into being perfect robots. Management does not have your back when you need it. I can't count the number of times when either me or another server had an issue with a table and management always took the guests' side - and the server was chastised harshly just because that specific table was full of terrible people.

This company is full of hourly employees who are just trying to make enough money to get their degree, feed their families, or just earn a little cash on the side and they are some of the most wonderful people I have ever met. It makes me sick to my stomach how poorly these people are treated by management. There is no room for error in this company, and all management and corporate cares about is lining their pockets at the expense of those below them. Those who choose to work for this company either: 1. become mindless GARStar robots who implement the wishes of corporate without any sense morality and compassion, 2. don't last very long and end up quitting after a year or so because they just can't stand it anymore (me), or 3. stick it out and pretend to be a mindless GARStar robot out of survival because they need the money - but they hate every second they are in that building.",Please start thinking FOR yourself and OF others.,1.0,,,,,

Employee activities and rewards are above expectations.,"This place is not bad if you want to lose your soul and personality. Their corporate standards strip employees of their individualism forbidding the use of any accessory such as piercings, jewelry,etc...that does not fit their conservative mold. As a minority I faced discrimination while working there and was told not to speak Spanish even to my fellow servers. They also have a problem with favoritism, if you are new expect to get the worst possible schedule. Management needs to be able to balance out these issues in order to be fair.",,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0

Everyone is so nice when you first start and always want to help and as you grow everyone is so good at letting you know that you have improved. The people who go to these restaurants are usually very nice and want to come out for a good time. So if you like to talk and mess around with people you'll do just fine here. You also get food discounts and cards after working there for some time. Your teammates really do feel like a family after some time and the parties are actually fun unlike a lot of office parties I've gone to.,"Its like working for Disneyland sometimes. If you're not smiling, you're reminded to. The training in the beginning is a little crazy memorizing a lot of recipes and wines. You have to memorize every ingredient in every item on the menu. There isn't really a way to move up out of waitering/bar tending unless you get lucky and are asked to be a manager and/or have been there for years. The tips are seasonal so the summer is hard to get through unless you work a lot of hours and/or have saved up.",Remember how hard it was when you were at this level and those days where someone stiffed you.

A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Be prepared to pick up the slack of others.,"Keep relationships professional. Developing personal relationships with employees fosters a toxic work environment. Not only does it cause animosity amongst the hourly employees, but it also allows for favoritism and inhibits the necessary disciplinary actions from being executed... thus allowing the company's values to degenerate.",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,5.0,
