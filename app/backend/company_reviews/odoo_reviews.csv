The product is THE BEST. Team activities are fun.","In a nutshell, if you are willing to have a less-than-thrilling work and take your below-mkt paycheck, you’re fine. The job is not that hard, and there’s no encouragement to do more. You’ll not be punished if you do the bare minimum, but will not be rewarded if you go beyond. You can easily arrive at 9 and leave at 5, take your lunchtime, hang out in the office. Motivation lasts for the first 2-4 months, and then you’ll realize it’s better to join all the other demotivated people and start looking for a better job. You’re a slave of your position, you can’t do, create, or try anything different if it is not explicitly demanded by your superior. Just do what your boss asks, and you’ll be fine.
Odoo is best for:
- Inexperienced people, who are willing to have 1st experience
- People who don’t want to work hard
- People who want to get into sales and then get a real sales job
If you do not fit in any of these buckets, find a company that respects people.
Benefits are not that good compared to other startups","Odoo needs a more professional approach. Upper management needs to understand trust, empathy, appreciation, meritocracy, internal structures, communication, and the importance of employees. The company needs to embrace change, management is blind and believes knows everything. You’ll be sitting in many unbelievably broken processes (which makes you waste a lot of your time, such as in repetitive tasks or tasks that add no value) without the chance to do anything.

2018-11-08,,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Not Great Compared to other SF companies,Less than a year,0,"-Employees come from very diverse backgrounds, not just a caucasian club.
-Some sales positions can yield decent commission pay
-Not much corporate culture, (Odoo in the USA is laid back) and does not demand drinking the koolaid
-The product is interesting and covers a wide scope, so there is much to learn
-Beer Kegs that are usually stocked
-Plenty of parking (unusual for san francisco!)
-Good place to get a start in tech... they often hire people straight out of college, and a couple teams have intern positions also
-Fantastic for spanish speakers because the LATAM departeent at odoo grows much faster than US and Canada","After you've been here for about a year you realize that it's really a weak company in so many ways and you'll start looking for a new job.

Odoo is a Belgian company, and most of the important decicions happen there. The belgian CEO has a huge amount of control over the product, sales, company direction, and he is even technically the director of marketing!!! As a result, working at Odoo in USA feels like working on a moon base that is totally separate. You never know why the company makes its decisions, where things are headed, what the goals are, what it stands for... For example, odoo just released a brand new version, but there was literally ZERO marketing about it. Instead they just sent out a ton of emails and push notifications to people in the us, canada, mexico and latin america about going to their annual event in BELGIUM. This is the kind of thing they do, because the strategy is not including this part of the globe.

It might not feel like a very bad job if it were not here in san francisco- but it simply does not even compare to other tech companies in the area, in terms of standards like salary, vacation time, WFH policy, equity, 401k, offsite company events, meal service, etc. They say they are growing all the time, but that just seems to mean that they are hiring more and more underpaid people instead of ppaying their current employees what they deserve. People are normally disappointed with their annual reviews and raises, THIS is why the job hunt tends to start at month 13 of the odoo carreer.

the partner system has flaws, we recruit partners but we are encouraged to just sign up anyone that might want to be a partner- it doesn't matter if they are going to be good at it or not. we try not to let really bad ones in, but still, the system leads to bad partners, and bad partners get disappaointed when they don't do well, and this spreads the word in a bad way. or, the partners don't do a good job of setting up the system for their customers and so their customers get disatisfied with odoo. Either way it's not good for spreading the word and getting a repuatation.

Also- if you are in any of the sales teams here (there are 3 plus a customer success team) then you will find yourself gradually getting fewer and few leads because of a few issues mostly involving overhiring and a tiny marketing budget. Seriously- do a google search on ERP SYSTEM ( which is what odoo is) and you will not find Odoo. The company does not spend money to advertise.

On top of the daily frustrations with the company and trying to do your job right, the vacation policy is really bad- it is two weeks maximum per year, and if you try to use sick time for something the company thinks is actually vacation, they will punish you for it , change your request to ""no pay time off"" and make the decision right when they cut your paycheck without even letting you talk to HR about it. This has upset so many people and even one of the best workers we had left in part because of this.","You have lots of good things going for you in your company and it could be great! But know that there are things that need to get better.

Hire an outside company to come in and evaluate the mess and make suggestions on how to fix things.

Spend more on marketing and don't blow it on dumb things like clearbit leads that are just basically spying on people browsing the internet

-Intelligent, caring and hardworking people
-Opportunities to travel (this is optional)

I have worked at Odoo for two and a half years, and this is one of the happiest work environments I have had.

Odoo gives you the possibility to make an impact on the organization.

Ever since I started at the company, there has never been a dull day. The company is still growing at a fast speed, we are still making mistakes once in a while but we keep learning. I now manage a team that I have to keep motivating in order for them to also grow and make out of Odoo the best possible experience.

I really admire my own manager because his door is always open to hear our concerns, frustrations and ideas. I never stop learning from him.

There is so much improvement that we can still do in the organization, but I do see changes going slow and steady. The most beautiful part of Odoo is not the product, is not revenue growing year after year...it's the people!

I recommend Odoo if you are looking for a place with a great community of smart people, a great product, a fast-growing environment with unlimited things that you could do to impact.","-No access to equity

2018-11-03,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,An amazing learning opportunity,Less than a year,0,"Odoo has a wonderful work environment. I have yet to encounter people as friendly as my ex co-workers at Odoo.
They value diversity, and will hire motivated people who can think outside of the box.
If you prove you are good at your role, you are able to build a good case to change teams. They are open to granting people horizontal movement within the company.","The amount of responsibility you get highly depends on your direct lead's management style.
It's still a small company here in the US, therefore the amount of career growth you can aspire to is also small.
The benefits Odoo offers aren't comparable to the San Francisco tech industry standard. They can really do a better job here, since this is a big reason for their employee turn over rate.
Lack of structured training or onboarding materials. If existent, they rely heavily on the team lead.","Take time to define processes within the company, and create some structure.

2018-10-31,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Very demotivating work environment,Less than a year,0,"Awesome co-workers
Interesting product and a good B2B experience
Flexible hours","Not sure who are those people who give Odoo positive reviews on this platform and if they are even really employees. The overall sentiment among employees in Odoo is ""it's only a matter of time until I leave"".

The employee retention rate is extremely low and most of the staff is currently looking for another job or waiting for their Visa to be approved.

This place is TOP HEAVY, in the sense that only 2 people from the Belgian office actually manage the entire group of 100+ employees. No one else is given responsibility/ authority/ or the proper respect and freedom to do ANYTHING.
This means: you will be micromanaged, you have no where to go in this company, expect your motivation to die very quickly.

If you are looking to grow, learn and be inspired by managers who are leaders and mentors, this is not the place for you.
Management will scrutinize employees over small mundane things which should not be dealt with by the executive levels. On the other hand, they don't reward employees who work hard and excel -EVER- and for that reason all the good employees leave.

This in turn creates an environment of demotivated employees who really only come to work to get the bare minimum done while they look for a real job in the meantime.

Now switching over to talk about the technical aspect of the job. Most jobs at Odoo require that you learn a very extensive software. In essence this is an ERP system. It encompasses things like accounting, inventory, manufacturing, sales, CRM, events, expenses and many more elements, each one holds a world of knowledge. In order to learn it and then teach it/ sell it/ provide support for it, you have to work hard and put in a lot of effort. In addition to doing your job, in order to be good at what you do, you have to spend time learning something new ALL THE TIME. Which means that motivation in this job is key. If you don't have it, you are doing the bare minimum. Sadly the bare minimum represents nearly all employees at Odoo.

They hire really good people with a ton of potential but due to the above reasons most employees end up striving to the middle, they loose motivation, and end up quitting if they are any good. This is how the company only maintains the mediocre employees and brings down the rest of the potential.

If you look past all the technical problems the software has, it's a great product to work on but it requires motivated, experienced employees who stay with the company for a long time. The approach of the managers is that everyone is HIGHLY dispensable. Both employees and even clients. They do nothing to make sure the employees and clients are happy.

 As an employee you can have 3 years of experience and an impressive track record and you will still get the same treatment as the day you started working at the company. This also translates to very small salary increases, only once a year and if.

More on the topic of career opportunities and the way Odoo SF is being managed in a very 'top- heavy' fashion: Some of the internal teams have a team coach. Coaches are usually chosen from among the more experienced employees. The coaches are responsible for coaching and coaching ALONE, which means that they have ZERO authority within their respective teams and only have the responsibility to teach their team members. The financial incentive the coaches get for the added responsibility is minuscule to a discouraging degree but the biggest issue here is that they can't manage and grow their teams because like all other employees they are only employees under the disguise of a coach. This creates a very confusing, unpleasant, fragmented work environment for everyone, including the ""coaches"".

As a client, once you bought your subscription, the amount of effort and care you will receive will plunge. Treating clients this way makes the employees' job much harder often times because you end up being stuck between an indifferent management and resentful clients with very little wiggle room.

What matters in Odoo is not if you are working hard or if you bring results, the only thing that matters is if the managers like you. If you are lucky enough to be favored by them, you will be treated with respect. If not, expect to be gruesomely degraded and treated with disrespect.",Hire leaders to refresh the management,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Odoo has a young, relaxed culture and is very forgiving of mistakes by employees. They want you to learn and grow, so they trust their people.

The customer churn rate is incredible due to the nature of the ERP business, until recently management would allow salespeople to keep commissions no matter what.","Odoo simply doesn't hire experienced resources. As a company, they believe in hiring young and training internally.

A downside to this is that they really don't have anyone who is a true subject matter expert. There isn't ANYONE in the Americas who has even 5 years of experience in sales, marketing, finance, project management, HR or any other area necessary for running a business.

That's probably why such a high percentage of projects never get completed.

Salaries are laughable, because Odoo doesn't fundamentally believe in hiring experienced candidates and they don't give out raises to tenured employees, they simply don't retain anyone who is really valuable.

Maybe its the Belgian culture, maybe its because its still basically a family-owned business, but Odoo could easily be growing 10 times faster if they had a different mentality.","Fabien, the majority owner and original developer, is the only person who could really be called management.

Odoo offers you first of all a nice and friendly place to work, with such an incredible fun environment (after-works, sports,BBQ, ...). Colleagues become friends within some days...
There is always an opportunity for people that are willing to take more responsibilities, of course you need to prove yourself!
Start-up mindset","Might be seen as an inconvenient for some: the organization and the structure.

2018-11-16, Sales,Brussels (Belgium),Former Employee ,A stepping stone,More than a year,0,"- good & fun atmosphere among colleagues, average age mid twenties
- very international people (mixed backgrounds)
- easy to get in if you're fresh off university
- company car","- no valuable training when you start: it's swim or drown

- office politics and arbitrariness from executives (see next point)

- no meritocracy (being best buddies with the executives will get you promoted, in some departments worse than in others; being disliked or even speaking up will get you fired quicker than you can imagine)

- hire and fire > managers see you as perfectly exchangeable, regardless of your track record or experience in the company

- ZERO homeworking (the company owner ""doesn't believe"" in homeworking because he tried it once and it didn't work out for him, so obviously it won't work for anybody else)

- zero flextime (you have to arrive on the dot and stick to your break times), today also known as micromanagement

- the company owner has a rude way of communicating with his employees

- no insurances, 401k, pension plans, etc.

- managers often not ready to help you grow as a professional

- pay is comparatively low

- no or very limited growth perspective in terms of career development

- management is usually all over the place and often doesn't treat employees with respect

- this place will drain your motivation like no other (see next point)

- the company makes minimal effort for their customers, and management won't back you up in case you need to step up for a customer; you alone can't help your customers so in the end you just end up with a whole backlog of unhappy customers, when you are the first line of contact and get all the hate from them

All in all this is an initially ""fun"" place to work and collect experience for about a year, but then becomes monotonous and after a while quite toxic; you'll witness colleagues being treated unfairly and will likely start looking for another job soon if you're smart. Every high potential colleague quit the company at some point, the employee retention is extremely low, and the vast majority of people are job-hunting.
Use it as a stepping stone and keep your guards up.","You need to realize that Odoo is not the best employer in the world just because you hire young and fun people. You need to offer appropriate benefits if you want to be competitive. You need to watch out how you talk to your employees in all-hands meetings. You need to show them that you actually care: this starts by checking on the way your executives treat their employees, over the way people are terminated (sometimes you come to the office just to get a mail that a colleague was spontaneously fired and you know it was because he didn't get on with a certain person above). You need to hire a capable C-suite that can help the owner steer the company!
