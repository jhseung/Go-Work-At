Make new games quickly, but build teams slowly. In mobile, you can make a prototype with 3-4 people. A prototype team doesn't need to be bigger than that.

Mismanagement all the way up the chain made that game set up for failure and it was killed shortly after being released. This is a very common theme there.

I remember the boss one crunch night commented on how our team was the best because “we make the funniest jokes and are the meanest”. After being on the team a while I was suddenly fired because “I didn’t care enough about the game”. I was given no warning or way to change my ways... even tho I was acting like most of the others on the team. The team already had really low moral since we had been crunching and the game was unstable. They claimed that I was committing lots of bad code but I had already talked to my boss about how I was being given half finished and buggy code to build off of and had one guy breaking my code (aka setup for failure). I was just the last person to work on the area and management was so poor they didn’t check anyone’s work before me (since it was the last part).

I can say, without any doubt, that joining Glu was the worst decision I ever made in my career.

Within a week of arriving, our president of studios was let go, and 2-3 months later, many central roles were also cut (with no head's up or attempt to shift people to other roles within the org) -- apparently, re-orgs were quite common at Glu (I don't know if that's still the case).

I also found Glu to be a highly political environment (departments within SF [but also studio vs. studio ] engaged in politics, jealousy, and backbiting) with non-existent leadership at the very top (De Masi was practically invisible; occasionally, he would make an appearance, usually at a monthly all-hands meeting).

I have reworded things to be a bit less derogatory with additional updates in brackets]

Everything. Management is disconnected from reality, both professionally and personally. They honestly don't understand things like how bad traffic has gotten and how unreliable bart is. [redacted] It's that bad.

Managers are constantly cycled through, and due to high turnover they regularly throw their subordinated under the bus in order to get themselves promotions.

Every other day or so one team that takes up half the studio gets catered lunches, [and other food], and all that jazz. They literally spend [lots of money] each year on entertainment while [the rest of the company] is constantly cutting salaries(yes your promotion and salary are not safe here), holidays, and other expenses. This team eats [catered food] 3 days a week while the rest of the company eats sea weed chips, trailmix, and Doritos. What's hilarious is they *literally* offer their scraps to everyone else when they are done with it. That's the kind of inequality you deal with at glu. It's outrageous.

Worse yet, you'll be told to be quiet just for having a quick laugh with a coworker, or playing in the game room ""too loudly"" yet this ""certain team"" can be heard at all times of the day through out the entire studio playing games, screaming, playing music, clapping, and spinning this stupid wheel that they use to decide where to order their next $5000 lunch from each and every day, while again, the rest of the studio gets to sit in silence and watch.

Glu pretends to care about your career, and will set up ""bonuses"" to help ""encourage"" you to further develop your career, but in reality they are just reducing your pay until you put in a whole bunch of extra work so they don't have to hire others to fill positions. Worse yet when they lose people they often don't refill the spot and they just make the rest of the team pick of the slack. Eventually either the whole team quits, or the whole team gets laid off and their jobs sent to India for ""under performing""

Oh did I mention India? Yeah, no reason to even bother working here any more as they are working each and every day to find a way to outsource literally every job they can to India, and [it appears that] they are even forcing employees to train their replacements in India before firing said employees. It's sickening.

This is just the tip of the iceberg too, they have a huge list of problems that comes from then spending as little as possible on as much as possible.

Their benefits providers have no idea what they are doing, can't explain missing money in flex accounts. Checks randomly never come through.

HR lies to you during salary negotiations.

Their ""secure bike storage"" somehow manages to have bikes stolen regularly.

They give you underpowered computers and then fire you when you take too long to finish a render.

Provides 0 space for employees outside of desk space. Using game room means people will literally yell at you for having fun

Managers will steal and take credit for your work

Leadership of HR actively keeps other women suppressed, same with some female managers. They seem to be upset at the idea of any women doing better than them and want to be the ""face"" of successful women at glu. Many women have been chased out of the company, specifically HR because of this.

Company gave away every single employees W2 to random phishing scam and bought the bottom dollar protection service form Life Lock which does literally nothing to help.

Refuses to pay more than $2 for headphones despite having open office floor plan and loudest office I've ever worked in.

Rife with fire hazards all over the building.

I interacted with many creative teams across several development groups at Glu. I was especially impressed by our collaborations with Glu Hyderabad and with Glu's User Experience Group.

Glu maintains ownership and stewardship of several solid franchises.

I saw significant pettiness when projects were ""peer-reviewed"" across studios. This includes the responses I saw from our own studio when we reviewed games developed by other teams. None of that was healthy.

We did not have enough mobile game players among the mobile game makers. Therefore, there was a limited real understanding of the market direction and our audience's expectations.

The management constantly shift strategies and never owns their decisions. This often caused lot of confusion and changes that needed to be made to accommodate their new visions. This of course slowed down the development process and wasted ton of resources. And to cope with these loses, they cut more jobs and closed down studios and ship those IPs to places like India to support the game.

The studio I worked at started with over 150+ people, and after only a year, the number had shrunk down to 60 or so people. By the time the game was shipped, they closed down the entire studio and laid off everyone who worked on the game. Those people who were directly responsible for making all the wrong decisions got raises and are still comfortably sitting at their offices and planning a next move.

• At this time, the game development part of Glu is a collection of different studios who have a specific area of focus (Action, Simulation, Sports, Casual, etc) and different work cultures.

• The San Francisco office is in a great location in downtown.

• I've had the opportunity to travel and work with other Glu studios around the world because of my role in game development.","As of this moment, I work in game development in San Francisco under the Action category, so my review is mainly from that experience. Due to the fact several products failed recently, Glu has laid off a significant amount of its development teams.

• For a company in the Bay Area that is global, it lacks diversity, especially in management.

• Benefits package is average but below average compared to direct competitors. (No 401k matching, 16 days of PTO, no daily catered lunches to name a few).

• You may get bored and feel unchallenged because of the lack of variety, creativity and innovation encouraged by management and over-aggressive monetization practices.

• Most of Glu's games and outlook of products for the near future are going to be rehashes of out-dated technology and recycled game-engines with a celebrity's name attached to it. Some may do well, many games have not and management will continue to do this because of a past success, á la the Kim Kardashian Hollywood game.

- Good office location.
- Free snacks, coffee, and drinks.
Good people still around but most have already left voluntarily or have been laid off.
- Free Lifelock Ultimate Plus for 3 years because the kind folks in HR voluntarily gave my personal info to scammers.
- Knowing I don't have to be here much longer.","- The C-Suite cares about the almighty dollar infinitely more than the people that make them that almighty dollar. Truly. They don't care at ALL about their employees. I've been in the industry for almost 20 years and most companies are good at pretending to value their employees. Here they don't bother.

- Communication to employees is atrocious despite repeatedly vowing to be more transparent. I found out about the GluW shutdown from seeing it posted on my LinkedIn feed.

- HR actually uploaded ""the data for most employees who received a W2 from Glu in 2015"" to a unknown scammer website.

- Ill-advised commitment to celebrity titles. KKH was a success so they invested EVERYTHING into the genre. Not a single release has even remotely come close to duplicating that success. Because of it, 3 studios have been shut down and work has been off-shored to India and Moscow.

- The company has an employee value proposition but it's hysterical to read since none of it is actually true.",You've never followed through on anything you've said you would do so just cash out and sell.,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

Great supporting and operational staff in the studios.,"Communication between studios and corporate in SF is abysmal. A breakdown between the C-Suite level and the studio leadership can doom projects and the jobs of the people working on them. Performance standards are uneven between studios and making it very clear which titles are the pet projects.

It's worth also looking at their insane commitment to celebrity titles - they're known as the company that developed the highly successful Kim Kardashian game. Since the success of that title, they have invested their entire future into celebrity titles. However, since the success of KKH, not a single one of their celebrity deals has actually translated into financial success and this is probably because ""# of followers on Facebook"" isn't a key indicator for success... and they might have known this if their market research and data analytics weren't in the stone age.

Finally, it's worth mentioning the huge data breach where pretty much everyone who worked for Glu in 2015 had their W-2s uploaded to an external website. It's hard to pick which of Glu's many failings to attribute this blunder to, so I'll leave it to the imagination.","I would say ""hire the right people and get out of their way"" but you've already hired and fired those people.",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0
2016-06-07, Associate Game Designer,"Bellevue, WA",Former Employee ,Incompetence and lies abound,Incompetence and lies abound,0,"At the studio level things were mostly good. Aside from a lot of strange hiring/firing decisions, which mostly trickled down from what I'll touch on in the 'Cons' section, I loved my day-to-day at the office. The people were great, the location (Bellevue, WA) was pretty nice, and when we were allowed the grace to do what we wanted things tended to go very smoothly.","Cooperate tended to lie to their employees more than not. And I do mean more than they would tell the truth, it seemed. They would say things like, ""We will not be downsizing. In fact, we will end up increasing headcount."" then a month later lay off dozens of people. This is one example of many, but an example I use because it was one of the more common lies Niccolo in particular fed us.

The folks running the show (the c-suite), I'm convinced, have no idea what it means to make a game. I feel like this is all too common in cooperate-run studios, but with Glu it seemed particularly egregious (I say that having worked in AAA). Niccolo, and a few others just below him, toured the studio to ""see what we were working on"" a few times throughout my time there. Each time it was a lesson in ignorance. They seemed to have absolutely no idea what they were looking at and could hardly even speak the game development language.

This incompetence was not limited to just development, it seemed many of the poor hiring philosophies implemented in upper management of studios has/had them hiring based on how well they like person as a person not as a developer. This led to a plethora of crippling issues throughout development, including ignorance of proper development practices, pipelines, management, you name it. Go figure, hiring someone based not in skill and experience ended up being a poor call. I fully expect no one at Glu to have learned from this mistake.

Glu actually made the decision to shut our studio down at the end of May. A decision I still have a hard time justifying to myself, considering our studio was lean and (more importantly) profitable. The c-suite then decided to offload all of our projects to the Moscow studio, a studio who's track record has been nothing but failure since my time at Glu started. As a result they have been non-profitable since before I started had there as well.

To top everything off, a few days ago I received a letter from the company explaining a breach in security/information. One of the folks in HR received an email from someone impersonating Niccolo requesting they upload all W-2 information from employees who worked there in 2015 to a website. They complied. This was a textbook spear phishing scam. The company had just willingly uploaded all of our personal information to a phishing scammer. They then chose to wait 2 weeks to notify their employees. More likely, they had no idea anything was wrong for the majority of these two weeks.
We are still receiving information as to how bad this breach really is. Some are reporting instances of information leaks to their family members as well. At this point in time it is assumed that anyone/anything referenced on our 2015 tax information is at risk.

Niccolo does not care about your product unless you are making a celebrity game. He does not want innovation, he does not want integrity, he does not want you to succeed. He wants the game to have a title with a big name in it so he can show how good that looks to investors and people looking to purchase the company. If you want to make a good game and have some level of security in your job (and information) I would recommend working anywhere else but here.","The sad thing is, no matter what I put in this box you wont heed it. We did this at the company, gave anonymous advice and complaints, and it did nothing. You don't listen, and I don't think you care about anyone working at the company.

How does one start a review without sounding bitter about working at this studio? That's the challenge because this was without a doubt THE WORST experience I have had in the business of working in video game design and production. Perhaps it's easier to just bullet point these negatives -

* The design department only ever finalizes a clear direction when they're at the finish line then expect everyone else to bend to their wavering, indecisive, safe and ill conceived whims. What's worse is that Production/Upper Management allows them to do so.
* Studio management is a 'boys club', you are either a member of it and can expect career advancement or you are VERY much not a member. If you are not you can expect to never be asked what you would like to do with your career nor see your base salary increase.
* Company CEO seems oblivious to the ineptitude of the GluW studio management, they fail (repeatedly) and point the blame at others and they carry on regardless while those under them lose their jobs because of THEIR failures.
* Unable to identify exactly why Deer Hunter 2014 was a runaway success they played it safe and created the same game in Deer Hunter 2016 with barely a fresh coat of paint, it failed miserably. With this failure the studio has now been reduced to a single game studio, down from it's previous production highs and positive atmosphere.
*Management laid-off two entire teams (30+ people) just a week before Christmas 2015, just a miserable, thoughtless and uncaring thing to do.
*Individual Directors (especially in Creative, Art) are disengaged and play favorites. They do not engage with the individual (unless they are a personal friend), openly lie about the studios future and the individuals role in upcoming projects. Carrots are dangled but they are quickly pulled away or in reality simply do not exist.
*Pay is well below the industry standard, the stock options offered are basically worthless given the continued stock price fall. No 401k matching, now non existent bonuses (bonus plan was pulled back to a once a year payout, now the employees have been told not to expect a bonus at all come February 2016).
*Expect to see your work/job turned over to an employee from the India studio who will complete your tasks for a 6th of the cost! A fact that was openly shared just before entire teams lost their jobs!
*There is no longer a well spring of creative direction at the studio, no solid choices based on wisdom, knowledge, inspiration and experience. Now just a light tread across safe waters based on data from uninspired data/number spinners which has ultimately led them to a creative and money making dead end.
* Work on bland games based on old technology, raise awareness that this could be a problem, be ignored, see the games fail - rinse and repeat!","Stop playing favorites.

The company has been farming development out to external studios for years and the San Francisco headquarters is merely a place for upper-management to gather and congratulate themselves on keeping the company afloat after years of poor decisions.

There is no foresight left among Glu's ranks. It's just a race to the bottom, chasing competitors and failing business models and avoiding any risk or innovation.

 - ""There is always one throat to choke."" is a quote from Niccolo M. de Masi during the company-wide meeting when Griptonite Games was acquired by Glu Mobile. Many Griptonite employees were mortified by this statement.
 - The previous CEO, who was cherished and a friend to many, was dismissed quietly before the acquisition. Management has no idea how to handle delivering negative news.

It was very liberating and useful, as we were given the right tools (mobile, laptop etc) to check in and make sure we were on track with projects.
You will work hard at Glu, but its worth it.","Glu is a company that is constantly struggling against the bigger mobile companies, and lacks the necessary push to make it to the top. The reasons are:
1. Capital. they had a few off quarters and the economy tanked in 2009.
2. Internal lack of leadership: there was a divide between internal groups as to which direction the company should head in in 2009. Hopefully this has been resolved.
3. Compensation was about 15% below the rest of the market. When it came time to talk about raises, there never was enough to go around. They would only award bonuses in case of a dire need or drastic change.","1. Figure out the internal issues and put them to rest.
