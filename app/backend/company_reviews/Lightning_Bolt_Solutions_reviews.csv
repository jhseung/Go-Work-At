2018-02-28,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Great company, awesome staff!","Great company, awesome staff!",0,Lightning Bolt is a dynamic and quality industry leader that has been recognized as first in automated physician scheduling for two consecutive years. Staff and consumers alike are both loyal and enthusiastic about the product. The environment was positive and lead to a lot of growth for me professionally. Salaries are competitive and I was promoted several times during my employment at LB. Management provides training and support to ensure employee and company growth while investing in each individual's career path. Confidence is now at an all time high now that new leadership is in place.,With growth there has been some changes in leadership. I see this as a plus however and the company predicts growth in their overall team.,Continue to invest in the team and support the growth of individuals. Thank you for all that I have gained working with LB!,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
2018-02-13, Applications Consultant,"South San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Newer management --> hopeful growth,Newer management --> hopeful growth,0,"Prefacing this review with: It seems like a lot of these reviews are either 1* or 5*. Let's be realistic everyone, Lightning Bolt is not the best of the best and cannot compete with other 5* places like Google. But it is also a cool place to learn & work and by no means is a 1* company.

Attempting to be as unbiased as possible, as a lot of these reviews are either mad ex-employees OR current employees whose job is to make LB look enticing (you can tell who these two groups are if you've worked here...)

-Bright coworkers. Warm, friendly environment. Very easy to get along with (most of) your coworkers.
-Work from home Tuesdays & Thursdays
-Flexible WFH, if wanting to take ""half-breaks"" maybe working from your hometown, etc.
-Snacks available in the office (chips, drinks, fruit, etc. Small lunch items available to make an OK lunch. Catered lunches about 1-2 times per month.
-Software idea is cool and is probably the best for the specific/niche market that LB is in
-Old management is being cycled out. For good or for worse, that's up to the individual. Personally, I think new management will be much better for growth in the long term
-Promotions/raises are looking quite good recently (past 6 months) as a point to combat other people's reviews saying low raises/promotions. BUT maybe this is only due to the employee turnover all at once
-Extremely easy to give feedback to seniors/leads/management and you will almost always get immediate changes if it's truly a good change
-Opportunities to work on side projects of interest: client facing, internal facing, sales, etc.","-TOTAL compensation is alright. Kinda low for the Bay Area in a tech-focused skill role. Salary is comparable, but no bonuses/equity (almost worthless)
-Consultant work is very, very support focused. Technical aspect >>>>> Support aspect in terms of intelligence, but you spend time doing about 35/65 (possible pro, if you really enjoy client success focused work)
-Work, in my opinion, doesn't feel rewarding. Seems like your job is to literally just prevent fires (make sure clients don't cancel/keep them happy)
-Growth paths can be kind of arbitrary depending on what the company needs, unclear if a position for what you want will be available

AND THIS ONE.
-The software...Conceptually, it's a great idea but the execution of the UI & back end codebase is SO poor.
-I'm pretty sure the UI won't be even half updated until 2019-2020, at which time half of those features will probably be defunct. What is the UI/UX guy actually working on? Everyone's unsure
-85% of your job as a Consultant ends up having to help clients because 1) UI is so god awful that it's too confusing for clients to do work on their own or 2) bugs, bugs, bugs everywhere-- which have an insane life cycle before they get fixed. Causes unintended, confusing results that you spend hours troubleshooting, only to realize it was a bug","-CEO is smart and friendly, but unsure if he truly knows how to run a business -- stagnating for awhile with ""hopes"" of Enterprise deals. Get someone who is experienced and can push LB forward if he cannot.
-Tuesdays & Thursdays work from home are extremely detrimental to productivity/culture/responsibility to company. Everyone reading this would be angry if this changed, but let's be honest -- if the company is to thrive, people need to work 5 days a week. Right now it's about 3.5-4 realistically.

Small advice:
- spend a couple hundred dollars extra on food a week, or hire a cook for the 3 hrs of lunch per week (MWF). A few thousand dollars is chump change to ensure that your employees are happy.
-Lightning Bolt as a company name is kinda odd...

2017-12-13,,"South San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Incredible place to learn and grow,Incredible place to learn and grow,0,"-Advancements in your career and growth as an employee. I started out part-time, and I am now part of our management team. In fact, most management started at entry-level and have worked their way up. You're also given the opportunity to gain experience in other aspects of the company that you're interested in. If someone feels their position is ""dead-end"", then that's most likely on the employee.

-Work-life balance is huge-- especially with the option to work from home. This is probably more of an outcome of the overall culture of caring for the employees. Any company should know that their employees are their most important asset, and Lightning Bolt embraces this.

-Working with great people that you can learn from. You're surrounded by very intelligent and bright people who bring different backgrounds and experience with them. There are a lot of friendships here, and we all want to help make sure each other succeed. If there are staff who are detrimental to moral, productivity, and the overall culture, management will make sure to address it.

-Easy access to management and the ability to have a voice within the company. All staff have one-on-one meetings with their managers. Anyone here can talk with the CEO if you want-- something I would've never imagined at my past positions.

-The office has been great to work at! I know most of it has been built with suggestions and feedback from the staff, and it's always getting updated based on suggestions from the team. The pool table is easily the most used toy we have!","-There have been some bad apples who created a toxic environment for the team (I believe they've left some reviews here). I see this as a growing pain, but the company has addressed this as needed (thank you!).

-Team hierarchies are still getting solidified. That can be tough as the team grows and the company tries to accommodate growth for the staff.","Continue to keep focusing on staff feedback and concerns. You've done a good job reinforcing everything staff like about the company, and it's great to see positive steps forward in being transparent about addressing concerns/feedback from the team.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
2017-10-04,,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,"Indefinitely stuck in ""Start-Up"" mode","Indefinitely stuck in ""Start-Up"" mode",0,"Great work/life balance, get to work from home every Tuesday & Thursday.

Newly remolded office with lots of space to work silently or as a team.

The incredibly smart team, always willing to answer any questions you may have.

Fully stocked kitchen; one side of the office is dedicated to leisure (ping pong, huge projection screen, basketball hoop, fully stocked bar (albeit with bottom-shelf liquor), in-house gym).

Opportunities to give your own input and be creative with projects.","Very lax work from home policy made it nearly impossible to collaborate with crucial team members as they literally never came into the office. (Even on days that are not ""work from home"")

Training is a joke, you essentially train yourself.

Compensation & benefits are abysmal, especially for the SF Bay Area.

Very cliquey work environment, if you don't fit in right away you are ostracized.

Several employees are given preferential treatment, they literally have a say in every aspect of the company within all departments.

Micromanagement is the norm at Lightning Bolt, it kills all motivation/momentum.

Very little appreciation is shown from management or senior team members.

Absolutely no room for career growth or development. Dead-end positions at a dead-end organization.

Lightning Bolt has been in ""start-up"" mode for the past 15 years and doesn't seem like it will take off anytime soon.","Stop promoting employees because they sleep with you, totally undermines the company culture & values.

Stop micromanaging your employees!",1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

I feel the turnover is due to the fact that there is little career potential for senior positions and many of the employees reach their full potential within a couple of years.
