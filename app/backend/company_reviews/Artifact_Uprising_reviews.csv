There's a new management team and they are doing things differently than the old management team. That's OK.

The company is focused on growing what is already a good business into a great business. Growth creates opportunities, and while things are different than when I first started, I have confidence that management will get it right, even if it takes a few tries.",Fast pace but I like it!,Keep up the good work and don't get derailed by naysayers.,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

If you are more senior, you will get bored quickly.","AU is not the high growth company it was sold to me as in the interview process. Company model is simple and easy to scale, but unfortunately the mismanagement at the top has disrupted the progress. Turnover is extremely high with many key positions and historic knowledge walking out the door. Pay is below market and equity is not an option to offset the lack of career path opportunities. Company does not promote from within and the over staffing of executives is leaving an environment of more talkers than doers.",Place more value on employees,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0

- The benefits are excellent (medical / dental insurance 95% premiums, 401k match, team bonding events, product discounts, etc.)
- Lots of exciting work to do
- Office perks - drinks, snacks, occasional lunches
- Delivering meaningful product to the world is very rewarding","- Absolute zero trust between the most of the company and the CEO and vice versa
- CEO is more focused on employees punching a clock than output; you’re only valuable if he sees you working in the office
- Company organization is incredibly top heavy, close to ⅓ of the company is in a leadership role, the recent talent drain is causing burnout and with a lack of individual contributors the CEO is focused on hiring more executives to make up for his shortcomings
- No equity in the company
- No opportunities for career growth
- Work / life balance is hit or miss and largely dependent on the team / manager","It’s time to replace the CEO or he should step down to a role he’s more suited for.

-A lot of potential to grow the business through low-hanging fruit
-Good benefits and some nice perks (team ski day, retreats, employee discount, 401k match
-Fast-paced environment so you're never bored","-Increasing divide between senior leaders and the rest of the team has negatively impacted the culture and resulted in a recent talent drain
-There's an underlying lack of trust and respect between leadership and the rest of the company (goes both ways)
-Leadership is making more decisions motivated by short-term financial gains often at the expense of what's best for the customer
-Emphasis on in-office ""face time"" and top-down micro-management leaves many employees feeling undervalued and burned out
-Pay is generally below market and compensation review process is opaque and inconsistent","Time to bring in a more experienced leader at the top with strong ethics, vision and a better ability to align and inspire the larger team.

Unfortunately, those people aren’t on the leadership team and are likely on their way out. The original founders and the impact they left behind is inspiring.","- Leadership is not trustworthy and does not have the employees best interests in mind.
- Culture of micromanagement and butts-in-seats
- If you disagree with any of the CEOs ideas, expect to have a target on your back
- The company is convinced it’s normal to lose 33% of your workforce within a 4 month period
- Pay is subpar and morals seem to be missing at the top of the ladder",Acknowledge your mistakes. Stop looking outward and start looking inward,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

He is not the founder nor the one that established the amazing culture that once existed. Don't think you're getting equity joining this start up because the CEO keeps it all to himself. He expects everyone to work extra hours and build the company up for him, while he takes 3 month vacations and adds zero value to the business. The company reorgs every time he listens to a new podcast or reads a new trendy business book. All the good people that make AU successful are leaving and those still working there are not happy. If you're interviewing for a position, just ask about the turnover. The turnover is taking a toll on the business and the toxic culture is starting to seep into the numbers.

Lots of room for growth and encouragement from management to try new things.","AU moves fast, pivots fast, and expects that everyone keeps up - even when that means your work week is way more than 40 hours.

- Quality products.
- Dreams big and lots of room for growth.
- Everyone works really hard.
- Management really makes an effort to make sure everyone feels valued.
- There's a high desire for open communication.","- Can be very fast paced environment. With a culture of everyone being of such high-caliber and working so hard, you have to work incredibly hard to stay on the same level (which, is also a good thing, but can leave you feeling like you're in the dust if you've had an off day or two).
- Work/life balance is a hard one to find. As in most startups, it seems like it's sun-up to sun-down, and following the lead from everyone else can leave you exhausted - and if you don't follow the lead, might make you feel like you aren't on the same level.",Keep doing what you're doing!,5.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0
