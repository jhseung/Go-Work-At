Others can be cruel- will let favorite staff go home and keep others working until they are the last people in the stadium.,"*Surprisingly, for such a big enterprise, they are extremely disorganized in having the supplies you need to start the job. I.e., the cups you need for that event aren't always available and when they are, you're lucky to have matching lids. Sometimes you'll have to pour every beverage from a bottle or can and/or remove the caps but you're not told this until a minute before open.
*You'll work non stop on your feet without even the chance to look at the time, let alone have a break. I wonder how they circumvent customary labor laws with this. Your voucher menu for a hot dog/pretzel or tenders/fries grows old very fast. More often than not, you'll be so busy you won't even get to eat until the stands that have what you're allotted are closing and the food is gone.
*There's no place to sit on your 'break' anyway, unless you sit on the floor.
*Sometimes they haven't enough shuttles to take you to your car so, after standing all night, you stand in line for a shuttle -which can add another 30 minutes on to your already long night.
*Most fans are reasonable and patient but many are rude and impatient. They insert their credit cards for a nano second and take off and you have to call them back, further delaying the wait for others.
For the most part, beertenders, especially experienced ones, don't play as a 'team' and want nothing to do with others in the stand. I've found that they are often possessive of their inventory and resent sharing, even if you're just trying to service the guest.
*Though some are great and helpful, a few workers can be hostile to newer staff and make the job more difficult than it needs to be.","Get a better internal system for having the necessary supplies available for every stand well before open time.

I personally watched my manager throw away a co-workers food because they stored it in a work cubby. However we don't get any discount on food during events (which is everyday) and all we get is a voucher for a hot dog everday. If we even get a break at all. Most employees do not get any breaks, even after working 10 hr shifts (boh does get lunch breaks, majority of the time. foh usually isn't allowed). But managers will sit right in front of us, not only eat but drink alcoholic beverages too. I thought that wasn't allowed. We had a manager so drunk on new years, he threw up on his shirt and continued to work. Also we live in Michigan, it is winter. They posted signs around the arena to try not to wear your coat inside. Because there's nowhere to store them . It's disgusting how these managers act, and treat their employees. Oh and HR will tell you, that they are overwhelmed and can't do their job accordingly. If you go to them with a problem, they will just inform your manager and you WILL get retaliated against, if not fired. And HR will not have time to even get a statement from you, or hear your side. You cannot have your cell phones on you . But nobody answers the phone if you try to call any restaurant . So if you have children , and there is an emergency there is no way they can contact you . You can't wear a jacket if you do get a break . However you're not supposed to be in company uniform . You have to pay $5 a day for parking, but you're not even guaranteed to get a shuttle if it's outside of shuttle hours. So now you either have to pay an Uber or walk the city of Detroit to get to your vehicle.

And I can only offer insight on what to expect with Delaware North in Kings Canyon. I'll start with what I think is most important, the food. Not much variety at all, but the Chefs do a great job of making every meal option delicious. The disappointing aspect is that all employees who applied this summer were promised meals priced at Breakfast - $3.25, Lunch - $3.50 and Dinner - $3.50. Even when you show up, you sign a document stating the cost of meals but it is not honored because and I quote ""the company is being stingy because they are low on funds."" They offer half off which ends up around $8 a meal, not exactly an employee benefit when its simply frozen meals from Sysco. Housing = cabin with plywood floors, gaps around the doors, disgusting beds, overcrowded (expect numerous people in a standard size bedroom), no heat/ac, no restroom or shower for employees within 200 yards (bathroom is being rebuilt so employees have to shower in guests rooms before they are cleaned by housekeeping), their housekeeping department is severely understaffed and results in numerous complaints everyday from high-paying guests (Also, HK is barred from getting tips from guests), management is staffed with the head honcho's friends who are suspiciously not required to have experience within the department, maintenance is understaffed and basically just available for guests' needs and employee housing is overlooked. The waiters are understaffed (but get the tips in return). The payroll department can't figure out how to deposit money to bank accounts or how to cut a big enough check to cover the hours you work (and getting lost money back from payroll can take weeks). Don't worry about getting a pay raise unless you have five years worth of patience. Schedules can change from week to week bringing you from full-time to part-time randomly. Complaints about working conditions are deflected elsewhere by management, similar to how front desk staff deflect guest complaints (nonchalantly and with no intention to fix the issue). Wifi is limited and cell service is non existent without Verizon. This list is not am exhaustive list, but do be weary when applying and be sure that you come here for the right reasons. In my opinion, you have to be either desperate for experience or be crazy in love with the wildness that this canyon has to offer. I'm here for the second reason and I feel like the luckiest person everyday. I just wanted to offer people a more open view of what the employee experience will be like here so that they can weigh the different options they may have.",Find some true experienced managers and put some effort and some of that $3 billion back into your properties.,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

As a cashier and a food service worker, my job entailed helping the customers, busing tables, and cooking the hot dogs and other food items. Things did get stressful during the rush hours but other than that, the work was pretty easy to grasp. The things I liked were:

-The dorm that I stayed in as part of the deal was just as good as any college dorm. And the rent was pretty cheap compared to if I had been staying in an apartment over the summer somewhere.
-The food was also very good tasting and there was a fair variety of options. The chefs were also eager to cater to the vegetarians as best as they could.
-The two days that I got off a week were perfect to spend exploring Yellowstone and the surrounding towns such as Jackson Hole and Cody.
-There were cool benefits like a discount to the store and a half-price for employees weekend.
-A lot of events were put on for the employees too, such as a July 4th event and a 'Yellowstone Christmas'.","The problems I faced were mostly with my co-workers.

I first applied for DNC over a month ago. One week after signing the background check (I had a misdemeanor for a bar fight some 5 years ago), I was told to pack my bags, I had the job.

Borrowing money to make the 1,800 mile trip, I arrived at Yellowstone National Park on the 18th of May, 2016. I completed orientation, training, and began work.

Two hours into my first day, the manager saw my background check and immediately fired me (no matter that HR had already seen it and hired me anyways). They did not pay me for orientation, training, or my labor. I was literally dumped off in Bozeman, MT in 28-degree weather, at night, and no way home. They literally left me to die.

Forced to hitchhike back home, I did meet two others who went through the exact same experience I had. We are all trying to figure out how to get the Department of Labor involved, so we can get what little pay is owed to us, but it is difficult as Yellowstone is a grey area of State and Federal land (we're getting the runaround between state and national labor departments).

Minimum wage is acceptable here though, because in Yosemite, housing is available and is super cheap. If you don't have a car and use the optional meal plan in conjunction with the 50% at restaurants, you can pay almost all your monthly bills on a single minimum wage paycheck. Save the other 3 each month and you'll have quite the savings account in no time. Not to mention that you can tell people you live in Yosemite, which in itself is an amazing experience. Days off you can go hiking, rafting, climbing, whatever.","Honestly- management is sloppy. Standards are low, and employees can get away with basically anything. Get into an argument with a coworker on the sales floor? Standing around talking with friends most of your shift? Show up late to work every day? No worries, management will just waggle their finger and say ""Don't do it again"", and not much else. Also- as much as I like the idea of what a union stands for, Unite Here does nothing but protect bad employees. There are people that have worked in Yosemite for decades, and so they get special protections, even though they hardly can do their job anymore (both from severely poor attitude or age). Also, policies are rarely upheld except on inspection days, which we are all given advance notice on. A week prior to inspections, we are all given tons of extra cleaning jobs on things that should be cleaned regularly anyways (but typically aren't).

My other issue is less with the company itself and more about the employee housing (which is operated by DNC). There are waaaay too many employees that need to learn to appreciate their surroundings better. When you walk around the housing regions, everyone's smoking or drinking (and they waste a huge amount of money, as the employee discount does NOT work for cigarettes or alcohol). It's a bad habit, and while I believe everyone should be entitled to do what they want, I still say that most employees are a bit excessive on these habits. You can save as much as $800/month on a minimum wage job if you're smart.","Be consistent, don't wait for inspections to shape up.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

Because of this, there is plenty of work and overtime during the tourist season. If you live locally it is a reliable place to work with minimal commute for us mountain folks. You will often gt to meet celebrities and other people of interest that are visiting the Park.","VERY dependent on tourist season. Sure you sometimes have foreigners in the off season but it is usually not enough to keep everyone working a full 40hr work week. Because of this there is often mass turn over. Either you get laid off for periods of time, or you are barely working part time hours. Each season is a little different of course.

Weather! Tenaya Lodge is well over 5,000 ft. elevation and you can get snowed in at work! Even if you have a 4x4, sometimes the road gets closed due to the extreme conditions or accidents blocking the road. When this happens, you are expected to work back to back shifts often many days strait to ""cover"" for other employees that cant make it in to work. Tenaya will usually comp a vacant room for you if you are stuck there, but you may be sharing that room with other employees depending on how many vacancies there are when this happens.

Management in most departments was very difficult to deal with at the time I worked. They either managed with fear, demanded that you did extra work off the clock, or just plain didn't know what they were doing. Some of this is due to management using work politics to promote their friends into management and supervisor positions. So as a result there are lots of shady management methods, personal junk, and sometimes even threats.","Stop promoting friends into supervisory/managerial positions if they don't have the skills to properly perform their job duties.

but main thing is the horrible managers that like to bully employees. (DAWN- horrible woman) Management takes advantage of TSA and security checkpoints. When inspectors or people they dont want to deal with come - (BBB, Health Department, Union Reps, even workers trying to collect their last check), they just wont let them up. Without an escort or a ticket, they cant come up. Once I even saw an inspector buy a cheap refundable ticket just to get up to inspect, they reported him to TSA. Because of Anti-Terrorist laws, its now illegal to buy a ticket without the actual intention of flying/ just to get past security.Think about it... Why would DNC managers NOT let these people up? Because they are low class and up to no good.
I stuck this job out for a few years because I was helping my mom payoff our house. Being young and having no work history, i didnt have much options. Because of this, I saw the incredibly high turnover that they have here. I literally saw hundreds of different people come through here. Yes, there were some longterm/lifers, but id say 70% of people there lasted anywhere from half a shift to 3or 4 months. Most people just got really sick of the management.
You have to park in an employee parking lot, and a shuttle picks you up. Then you have to go through security. So from the time you actually park, wait for the shuttle, and then make it through security, you no joke waste AT LEAST 20-30 minutes out of your day - EVERY MORNING, without fail.That adds up. Thats like 2-3 hours a week that you are ""at work"", yet not getting paid.
By the way -Not getting paid? These guys have been in several class action lawsuits for not paying overtime. many times I dealt with this BS myself.
Also many customers are nice, BUT many are VERY VERY RUDE and they are aggravated because they missed a flight, are traveling tired and hungry, and are just looking to vent/blow up on someone. Because of very bad management, you will ALWAYS be out of certain items, which customers will (of course ) ALWAYS want and lose their minds over. Some of these people were beyond childish. Even then, I think the managers were worse.
Last but not least, Im a Marine Corps Sgt, and even tho I've literally been dug through the mud in the Corps, I feel I was ALWAYS treated better and with much more respect in the Corps, even while getting hazed, yelled at, getting broken down mentally and physically. At least that served a purpose. The managers at DNC bully people simply because they feel they can, they are in somewhat of a loophole. Its literally too hard to check up on them because of TSA checkpoints. So they abuse what little power they have in life, to try and make themselves feel better by trying to bring others down. Maybe thats why bootcamp was easy for me, because DNC was a hostile workplace from hell that was even worse.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Change your budgets! Staffing is done by numbers from a YEAR AGO! We are in a river town. Business is always dictated by the weather.

My manager was flexible with scheduling, so I was able to plan some longer hikes and trips to nearby national parks around my work schedule. How demanding the job is really varies from store to store, so be sure to ask the HR person who interviews you for a more relaxed or fast-paced store depending on what you are looking for. I worked at Old Faithful Upper and it was super fast-paced, which is something I thrive in, but for some people it was more than they'd bargained for.","They only paid me $7/hour, before you count the money DNC took out of my paycheck for room and board, and the money the government took out for taxes, which brought it down to $4/hour.

The corporate office is responsive to the needs at the local level.","At the entry level, this is the food business and the pay is low compared to other professions. An employee can be held down by a general manager and/or area manager for different reasons. If an employee is performing multifunctions at a high level for a low salary, they may not be reccommended for advancement and/or rewarded for their efforts because they can not be replaced efficiently. An employee's loyalty and perfomance can be overlooked by their GM and used to advance their own careers. This goes beyond favoritism or personality conflicts, it simply can be what's best for the GM's bottom line. When a loyal, experienced employee has taken on numerous tasks with minimum staff , is totally consumed time-wise, and performing at a high level, opportunities can go to other managers who simply have more time, less responsibility and more support. When a GM hires a manager from the street without giving the opportunity to a high performing supervisor within, that supervisor is left feeling unappreciated and stuck in a rut.",Continue to be the leader in the industry and to evaluate more completely GMs. Encourage area managers to look beyond just the GM's opinions of their direct reports and actually search for talent that can benefit the company beyond their direct report.,2.0,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,
