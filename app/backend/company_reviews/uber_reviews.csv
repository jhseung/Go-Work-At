- Disorganized managers/managers who lack, experience

- HR

I would have given a one-star rating if not for the amazing potential of this company! Uber could really go places. But the company is its own worst enemy.

Quality work is not rewarded. It's not even encouraged. The focus is on how fast can you turn out a product; not how good of a product can you turn out. Other departments may be different, but I doubt it. The ""just-throw-something-together-quickly"" mentality permeates many departments I have interacted with. Most people on my team are just waiting for the IPO and the post-IPO waiting period, and then they will cash out and move on for this very reason. You can't treat smart, innovative people like piece-work factory workers and expect them to stick around.

To HR: You're not as smart as you think you are. That is not to say you are not smart; It's to say that you think employees are naive and easily-manipulated Kool-Aid-drinkers. And, oh, you love your Kool-Aid. Your cheerleading sessions are impressive. Varsity-worthy. I'm all for positivity and pep talks but in organizations that want to innovate, positivity needs to be tempered with a tolerance for healthy challenge and conflict. I'm not talking about being mean or demanding here; I'm talking about allowing a safe environment for people to present dissenting opinions and different ways of doing things, without managers becoming defensive or bashing you for not being a Pollyanna. For all their talk of diversity and inclusion, diverse opinions are not welcome at Uber. (At least not in my department. I would hope in mission-critical product operations dissension for invention is enouraged.)

Innovation only applies to the high-profile products (Elevate, autonomous vehicles, app updates.) Any department that is not in a direct consumer-facing or transportation product development role gives lip service to innovation, but are stuck in archaic ways of doing things, which I find quite odd for a tech company. Despite this, employees in these departments are killing it with creativity with what they have to work with. The phrase there is ""with what they have to work with.""

The reason I put flex and unlimited PTO as both a pro and a con is because it's sort of a mirage, or a shell game. If you work a weekend day, you can take a week day off, ""if"" you don't have any work to do, or you can ""flex"" and get your work done another time. Well, there are too many meetings and too much ambiguity and too much work and too much lack of direction to allow for any efficient work processes at all. I know PTO and work/life balance is different based on department and roles. But much of the overwork could be eliminated with thoughtful processes and clear objectives and, frankly, competent management. Honestly, sometimes with managers it's like the blind leading the seeing.

Many of the reviews mention that this is a ""startup,"" which they use to excuse the ambiguity, haphazard processes, and chaos. (And make not mistake, it is chaotic here.) You can't call a company that is a decade old and has 12,000 global employees a startup. It's time for Uber to grow up. After ten years, it's time to figure out plans, procedures, and processes for each department. And hire managers with mature mindsets. (I don't mean ""old"" mindsets; I mean mature mental processes.) Many managers here run around like headless chickens. (Some managers, however, are quite competent and effective, but they are the rarity.) Most people on my team, even if they like working for Uber, are frustrated in their job because they are not given proper time to develop quality products and ideas.

Managers (again, only speaking for my department here) are quick to throw some employees under the bus, while coddling others. Favoritism reigns supreme.

So, with so many ""cons,"" why am I still at Uber? No, I don't think I'm masochistic (although I am beginning to question this the longer I remain here.) I am hoping against hope that after the IPO that shareholders will put pressure on the company to change its ways and mature into the organization it is capable of becoming (er, I hope it is capable of becoming a great organization, anyway). And that includes a path to profitability. The company has made positive ""for show"" strides post-Travis, but only because the company was forced to in order to get its house in order for the IPO. Without outside media pressure and the public comments of some previous employees, I doubt the company, internally, would have been motivated to change on its own. Everything now is a show for IPO. What the company turns into after that will tell the real story of what the company is, or is not, made of.","Hire experienced, competent managers, be honest with your employees, encourage outside ideas (and don't stay stuck in the ""not-invented-here"" syndrome), treat all employees as close to the same as reasonably possible, and do what top companies do to engage employees: allow them to do the work they are capable of doing. Perks are great, but perks are not culture. Don't confuse the two, which you seem to do now.",2.0,,,,,

I also like that we had free snacks and meals. Location is decent, located near a BART station though that will change soon with the new office in Mission Bay.","I don't even know where to begin, everything I learned through my experience at Uber was basically a confirmation of things NOT to do when managing a team, building a new org, developing new processes, and implementing policy changes to external customers. Perhaps it's given me valuable insight into what doesn't work.

The company grew quickly and has reached a size, in my opinion, that isn't considered a ""start up"" anymore. However, the tenured folks there still had that ""move fast, break things"" mentality without realizing that now their mistakes have a cascading affect across 100s of people working in their org. I'd like to have seen more strategic and intentional decisions versus experiments (sometimes even ignoring data) based on ""intuition."" I also continued to see people being handed roles only because they were there at the right place, right time.

Middle management was the worst I've seen with first-time managers who had little understanding of how they should serve their team. There was no trust between my team and my manager although we got along well outside of work. With this type of management, there was no accountability into one's work and very little (if at all) individual goals.

Dara's All Hands were usually inspirational, but I rarely felt proud about my work. I wasn't challenged and felt like I was wasting my time, not being able to contribute in a more meaningful way. My skills and experience wasn't put into good use.

All of my coworkers are miserable in their roles and feels stuck. I pray that they will be able to dig themselves out of this hole and find something more engaging. The benefit was also SO BAD and management continued to ignore and delay a proper response despite MONTHS of effort from team members across the US to bring this topic to the forefront. When I left the company for a new job, my new salary literally increased by more than 3x of what I was getting at Uber.",,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

There are many good teams in the org with necessary contributions such as hardware, laser, vehicle platform etc and it really takes a larger org to build a self-driving car","* Repeated strong success of deep learning models coming out of this group comes with a territory and politics in the org which is really universal across humans/workplaces especially in a competitive area like self-driving.

* It is very important to be unaffected/able to stay out of wider politics and continue cranking out work/results if you are at Uber ATG. This can be challenging but overall the results coming out of ATG Toronto, the problem and data are amazing and the org is moving in the right direction.

* Not all humans in the wider org are unbiased/honest with themselves. Some of them are, more should strive to be. This is a fact of life in most organizations unfortunately.

- Dara is great.","- The company is so huge that learning to be diplomatic when working with other teams is a necessity. Sometimes the people you have to work with will not want to help you but you have to find a way to deliver anyway.
- There was a period in 2017 when the company was in a deep cultural crisis. That was a weird time and things are very different now than they were pre-crisis. Uber is a little more grown up, but a little less fun than it used to be.

There's a huge amount of scope for professional growth and learning, but it doesn't always come with a new title and a pat on the back.

Also, I wholeheartedly don’t believe that diversity and inclusion is a priority here, which is unfortunate because many of the contacts we support in SORT are people of color. Majority of the efforts towards D&I seem to focus on gay males or transgender. Extremely poor management and acknowledgement of toxic people with concerning work ethics. Currently, after several reports made from a handful of different individuals from different LOB’s in different shifts; employees leaving the company unwilling and involuntary, claims made from Racist to sexist and micro aggressive behavior about a specific lead who has went from day shift to night shift from removal of his team to now not having a team at all and holding the only position as a “floating lead”, there is a completely distrust towards upper management and the representatives that support the app users.","Longevity and the eagerness to further develop professionally here to eventually transfer to another COE was a dream that was held in high hopes. However, to have CSR concerns constantly disregarded and ignored while continuously support a team lead who has had numerous negative reports brought upon them, is very troublesome and will eventually push away some of the most effective CSR’s to other company’s that pretty much offer some of the same benefits as Uber does.

I can with confidence that Uber is the best place I've ever worked.

The challenges are fascinating. We're not just building a website or driving ad clicks. We're attempting to fundamentally change the way people and things are transported around the globe.

The impact is tangible. At a place like Google, it's easy for an engineer to feel lost in the weeds. Uber has become a big company, but every project still feels vital. Every engineer has the chance to affect millions of riders and driver partners.

The opportunities are abundant. Uber has grown faster than any startup in history, but that growth meant there wasn't always time to build to scale. That's both a positive and a negative at times, but on the plus side, it means there are many parts of our tech stack that can be optimized and improved by a motivated engineer. If you want to take ownership or a project you feel passionate about, no one is going to get in your way.

Change is happening. 2017 was a real wake up call for Uber. Thankfully, the company took note and listened. We're now refocusing on the longterm sustainability of growth and talent. I've seen so much positive change happen in just over a year. It's been a roller coaster of emotions at times, but it always trends upwards.","On the con side of the tech debt problem I alluded to before, there are parts of the engineering process that are painful at times. We've been committing resources to fix it, but there's still a lot of room to improve.

Different parts of the organization still feel oceans apart. Maps reminds me a lot of Google, other parts of the company feel like other organizations entirely. We still have a ways to go towards homogenizing our values and standards, but things are improving. Just be mindful of which team you end up on if you decide to join. that said, transferring is easy and encouraged.

The media attention can be draining. The world can't seem to stop talking about Uber. In some ways it feels motivating to be working when all eyes are pointed your way, but it can also be painful to be put under such intense scrutiny.","Keep focusing on the long term. Uber a platform is the future of the company. Growth at all costs was not the right approach. We need to focus on brining the best tech to the market, with the right investments in the right industries (Eats and Freight are two great bets).

The pay is garbage. There is no 401k match. The equity is laughable at best.

There is absolutely no sales training and coaching. Career mobility is zero. And there is nothing else to sell other than 1 thing.

Cool technology and growing industry.
Most co-workers are friendly.
Really awesome job to start out.
In the beginning, I felt like I made a difference and helped to improve the technology and the future.
My job felt like it had meaning.","The reorganization.

I was hired as a Test Operator and I loved the work we did. It was challenging and fun. The managers cared, listened, and respected us. We were a productive, engaged team. I was happy and, as far as I could tell, so were the rest of the test ops team. I felt like I made a difference.

But it was too good to last.... They announced a reorganization complete with all new job titles. One of the job descriptions was almost exactly the same as what we were already doing but we were told we would no longer be allowed to do this work anymore. We would need at least 6 months with Uber to apply. Our department had not been around 6 months and all but a handful of us did not meet that requirement. The good news is that this new job would come with a raise, if you were able to get it.

Our new job would be VO, the job duties were significantly decreased and we lost some of our benefits. We were merged into another department and now work under their management.

The work now feels meaningless and empty. I’m unsure of the short term goal and can’t seem to get a clear picture of how the reorganization contributes to the longer term goal in any meaningful way. I’m struggling to keep motivated with the loss of direction and my role in improving the technology through this new position.

Our new managers play favorites with the people they have been working with from the beginning. We’ve had no opportunity to get to know the people we work with/for.

Most employers grandfather people in to their benefits/job duties when they make a decision to reorganize like this. It shows respect for the talent that you have recruited with the promise of these benefits/duties.","Just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you should. Your decisions have huge effects other people’s lives. Some of us left other jobs based on the job we were offered, not what it’s become.

The reorganization could have been accomplished differently with the same end result and happier employees.

Managers may benefit from leadership training and a discussion about preferential treatment.

Remove time based constraints for applying to the new positions created by the reorganization so that everyone can apply. This is a win-win because you can hire the best people for the jobs and employees feel they have an equal opportunity.",2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0
