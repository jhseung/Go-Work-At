# Go Work At

__This is the final project of Cornell University's CS/INFO 4300 class.__

Having experienced firsthand the difficulty of finding jobs, we wanted to turn this experience around. The job application process does not take into regard what we truly seek in a job. Go Work At aims to provide a way for job-seekers to find jobs relevant to their skillsets that also align with their expectations of the company.

Incorporating different information retrieval methods such as Jaccard similarity and SVD (ML), we utilized job postings from Indeed and company reviews from Glassdoor to create a ranked list of job postings, tailored to the user's needs and wants.
